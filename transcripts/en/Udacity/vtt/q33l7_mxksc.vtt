00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.905
Okay interesting fact time,
did you know that there are roughly

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:09.574
320 million users with some form
of color vision deficiency?

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:12.431
To put it another way that
means 1 in 12 men and

00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:16.576
1 in 200 hundred women suffer from
some form of color blindness,

00:00:16.576 --> 00:00:19.943
which affects men much more
substantially than women.

00:00:19.943 --> 00:00:23.507
That also means that around 1 out of 20
users of your site will likely have some

00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:25.650
form of color vision deficiency.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.280
Now imagine telling your manager that 1
out of 20 users of your site will not be

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.120
able to complete the experience.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.170
That seems like a conversation that
wouldn't go over very well, but

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.350
when we rely too heavily on conveying
information with color alone,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.300
that's effectively what we're
setting ourselves up for.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.980
To give you an example, here's a form
that I filled out previously, but

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.950
something's wrong.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.410
Can you spot it?

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.160
All right, how about now?

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.230
Notice that the telephone
number field is underlined red

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.360
signifying that it's invalid.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.950
But to a colorblind user or
a screen reader user,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.550
this information may not be conveyed.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.590
And because of this, you should always
try to provide multiple avenues for

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.069
the user of your site to
access critical information.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.650
The WebM checklist specifically
states in section 1.4.1 that

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.520
color alone should not be used as
the sole method of conveying content or

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.890
distinguishing visual elements.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.240
And that color should not be used to
distinguish links from surrounding text.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.940
Unless they meet certain contrast
requirements which we covered in our

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.560
previous lesson.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.460
Instead, the checklist recommends
adding an additional indicator

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.750
like an underline to indicate
when a link is active.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.880
So an easy way to fix that previous
example is just to add an additional

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.240
message to the field
announcing that it's invalid.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.040
When you're building an app, try to
keep these sorts of things in mind and

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.180
watch out for any areas where you
may be relying too heavily on

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.940
color to convey important information.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.820
If you're curious,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.100
you can use the NoCoffee chrome
extension to simulate various

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.890
forms of visual impairment including
different types of color blindness.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.860
If you're relying heavily on
the use of color in your UI,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.880
you may want to do a pass
using a tool like NoCoffee

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.400
to see if there are areas
where you can improve things.
