00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.512
The roots of this parabola are 1 plus or minus i times the square root of 21

00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:08.996
over 7. This is a simple case of using the quadratic formula to solve, and

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:13.802
actually I had to do this problem way earlier on in the lesson. You may not have

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:18.347
even remembered it. And this time you got to do it totally on your own. And

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:23.157
you've also got to write the answer in the complex notation that you know about

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:23.459
now.
