00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.074
First I want to generate a yLow. .nextDouble will give me something between 0

00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:09.000
and 1, but I want it to be between 0 and 2, and I definitely want a double.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.643
Because yLow could be anywhere between 0 and 2. Then I'll generate another

00:00:14.643 --> 00:00:19.187
double between 0 and 180, and I'll use both of those to calculate yHigh, which

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:25.368
is yLow plus the sin of A in radiance. Now if yHigh is greater than or equal to

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:30.666
2, then I increment the number of hits. But I want to do all of this try as

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:34.692
times, so I'll highlight it all, hit tab to indent, and then wrap it in a for

00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:41.820
loop. And I'll need to actually declare hits. Which starts off at 0. All right.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.542
Let's try this. I'm going to try it 30,000 times. 3.13. I guess it's okay. It's

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:53.350
not great. Let's try it again. 300,000. It's a little closer to 3.14. How about

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.495
3 million or 30 million? 30 million. This one might take a second but not that

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:05.846
long. 3.141. We're getting much closer now, but it took 30 million flips. And

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:11.320
Pi is actually 3.1415 something or another. So we've only got three digits

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.543
correct. I think anyone who tried to do this without a computer would be

00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:20.250
flipping needles for their entire life. This method was simply not viable

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.400
without a computer.
