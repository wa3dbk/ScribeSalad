00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.510
A platform which terminates apps on its own is a pretty radical departure for

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.920
anyone like me who cut their teeth on desktop Winforms development.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.910
If you come from a similar background you probably have

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.912
a pretty good idea of what to expect in terms of lifecycle event handles.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.380
You start with the onCreate call back where you build and wire up your UI.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.910
Once that's done, your activity has been created. It likely won't be a surprise

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.650
to you that there are also event handlers for when the activity becomes visible.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.970
Which is onStart and another for when it gets focus and becomes the active

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.255
foreground app, which is onResume. That same sequence, then happens in reverse.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:48.542
[SOUND] onPause indicates that the activity has lost focus, followed by

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:54.283
onStop when the app is no longer visible. Finally, there's an onDestroy method,

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:58.540
indicating the end of the app lifecycle. When your app is first launched, you'll

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.265
quickly move through these states. Create, Start, Resume, one after the other

00:01:03.265 --> 00:01:06.803
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:10.985
But within the full application lifetime, from when onCreate is first called and

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:16.480
till the app is finally terminated. It will move through the active lifetime and

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.640
the physical lifetime, many times. Let's look at those in a little more detail.
