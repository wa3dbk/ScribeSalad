00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.150
Let's take a look at Lauren's example of ABCs in the natural environment. In

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.726
the first example, she talked about thirst. Thirst was our motivation. The

00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:15.438
refrigerator was our cue, or discriminative stimulus. And the behavior was

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:20.870
grabbing a soda and taking a drink. And then we said the thirst is quenched.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.935
But lemme ask you this. are we adding refreshment, or are we removing thirst?

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:32.759
In the second example Lauren says that we spit out the milk, because it tasted

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.840
bad. so here did we add an unpleasant taste, or did we remove a bad taste?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.064
These are 2 good examples to demonstrate that sometimes it's difficult to

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:47.600
distinguish whether something is being added to the environment or removed from

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.198
the environment. But just remember, if behavior increases, it is reinforcement,

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:58.049
and if behavior decreases, it's punishment. We also want you to know that some

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.697
people in the field argue about whether or not we even need the distinction of

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:05.630
positive and negative punishment or positive and negative reinforcement, and it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.054
is difficult to tell. For example, if you're cold and you put a sweater on, are

00:01:12.054 --> 00:01:17.713
you adding warmth? Or you decreasing cold.
