00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.030
So continuous integration just means
that whenever you check in new code,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.800
it gets integrated, and built.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.090
But seriously we're not
going to do that by hand.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.220
Running the compiler and
test suite is a job for a program.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.820
And no surprise there are a lot
of pieces of software to do this.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.640
One of the most popular ones is Jenkins.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.800
It's an open source
project written in Java.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.380
You have to host it yourself.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.120
There are also several
hosted CI solutions.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.210
Like Travis CI and Circle CI and others.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.190
All of them work on the same principals.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.101
The CI system,
watches a code repo or branch.

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:36.350
What it is looking for
is new commits written by developers.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.200
When a new commit occurs the CI
systems grabs the new commit and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.920
spawns a build process.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.830
The build process runs and builds things
such as compiled binaries or data files.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.920
Once the build is successfully complete,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.900
the CI system then spawns tests that
can be run on the build artifacts and

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.390
then it reports the results
back to the developer.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.340
Now, since most of the hosted CI
solutions require subscription, for

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.550
the next part of this course,
you will be setting up and

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.940
using your own Jenkins server
