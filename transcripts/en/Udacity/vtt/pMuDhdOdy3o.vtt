00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.450
This hyporbola is centered at 1,2 and has an a value of 4 and a b value of 3.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.056
Good work if you got all three. We'll start by graphing the ellipse. The

00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:18.030
ellipse will be centered at 1,2. So we go 1 unit right and 2 units up. Next we

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.160
move 4 units left and right in the x direction from the value of a, then we

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.480
move 3 units up and down and the y direction for the value of b. Now we're

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.579
ready to start constructing our hyperbola. We draw a dashed rectangle around

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.040
our ellipse and then we connect the diagonals. We'll cut open our ellipse and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.432
then we'll flip the two halves outward, and this will give us our hyperbola. We

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:46.441
want to make sure that the ends of the hyperbola are stretching out to the

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:51.808
diagonals. This curve will always approach this dash diagonal and this dash

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:56.930
diagonal. It's one of the special properties for hyperbolas and you should look

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.260
into it more if you're interested.
