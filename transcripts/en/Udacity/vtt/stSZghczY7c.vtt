00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.470
Net Cat gives us a simple model
of a program using the network.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.580
But it's a lot simpler than the way
that a standard web browser and

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.130
server use the network.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.380
Browsers and servers don't just
handle a single request or

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.390
a few requests one after the other.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.560
They also work on several
requests at the same time.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.340
When your browser loads
a web page from a server.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.700
It usually has to load
a lot of different files.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.810
The HTML itself, plus images,
scripts, CSS, and other data.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.570
The more that it can do this
in parallel the faster it can

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.009
render that page onto your screen.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.330
Or imagine that you're in charge of
the server that's sending this video

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.750
to your browser.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.510
You're probably not the only
person watching it right now.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.590
You might be near the end of
the video while someone else is just

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.830
starting to watch it.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.330
So the data that the server is sending
to you isn't in sync with what it's

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.790
sending to that other person's browser.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.650
And there are a lot of different ways
that programs can handle multiple

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.460
connections at once.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.710
One of the most basic ones is
what early web servers did.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.060
And what many programs
such as SSHD still do.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.450
Whenever a new connection comes in,
the server process forks,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.530
it asks the operating system to split
it in two, like a cell dividing.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.690
A different model that many more recent
servers use is to create a pool of

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.080
processes or threads, each of which
can handle one connection at a time.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.640
And this is faster than
starting new processes.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.380
But it does have the downside that
there's a limit to how many requests may

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.390
be handled at once before
things start to slow down.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.560
And finally a third model is
to have a single process that

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.450
quickly switches between handling
requests as they become available.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.680
There are a few different facilities and
operating systems for

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.700
doing this efficiently,
such as the epole function in Linux.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.570
But before your server
can handle a request,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.890
the client has to know how to
get in touch with your server.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.890
Up ahead, we'll take a look at DMS,
the directory system for internet hosts.
