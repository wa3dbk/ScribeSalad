00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.097
Here is a filled out version of our table. I simply plugged in each value of x,

00:00:04.097 --> 00:00:07.171
into either of our two functions over here, to fill out these first two

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:13.104
columns. Then to fill out the last column pq of x. I just multiplied the two

00:00:13.104 --> 00:00:17.278
numbers in the cells adjacent to it together. Negative one times five is

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:21.849
negative five. Zero times three is zero, and so on and so forth.
