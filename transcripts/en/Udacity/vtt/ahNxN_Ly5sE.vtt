00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, so that allows us to substitute 1 string. What if we want to substitute multiple strings?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is how to format, like this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If we want to substitute multiple variables into a string,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we can include multiple % s's, but it means we need to include multiple variables.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you don't include enough variables, Python might get mad at you.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Why don't you try that out in the editor? We'll do a quick quiz.
