00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.578
The algorithm you just looked at would work if Robby were a person. But Robbie

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:06.980
is a robot, and only knows how to do very simple tasks. Moving to the first

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.570
place where he sees a yellow before a blue is too complicated. He can only do

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.320
simple tasks. So, he could move all the way to the left. Or, he could move all

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.830
the way to the right. He could move one space to the left or one space to the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.270
right. He can check if the block right in front of you is yellow or blue. And

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.960
he can check if the block, just to his right is yellow or blue. I'm going to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.070
have you write some pseudo code, but so that I can help you check it, I'm

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.020
going to give you some of the structure up front. Use the pseudo code commands

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.879
over here to write pseudo code to move Robbie to the leftmost yellow brick

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.370
that's followed by a blue. These lines are scrambled. Can you type them into

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.353
the right positions? You might need to type a line more than once.
