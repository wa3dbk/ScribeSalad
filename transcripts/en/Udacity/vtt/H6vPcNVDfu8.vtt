00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:03.807
Let's take a look at a commonly used kernel in scientific computation.

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:08.103
This is called N-body computation. In an N-body computation you have N objects,

00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:11.664
each of which exerts a force on each other object.

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:17.580
You'll use N-body computations to, say, model the gravitational interaction between stars and a galaxy

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.644
or the electrostatic forces between a number of charged particles.

00:00:20.644 --> 00:00:25.252
It's the way we compute molecular dynamics, which in turn can model protein folding and misfolding

00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:28.688
and is an important component of our understanding of disease and drug discovery.

00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:31.458
N-body techniques are used in folding at home, for instance.

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:36.229
The specific formulation of N-body computation that we'll discuss today is called all-pairs N-body,

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:42.703
and I'm basing this discussion on an excellent article by Lars Nyland, Mark Harris, and Jan Prins in 2007 in GPU Gems 3.

00:00:42.703 --> 00:00:45.773
All-pairs N-Body is the simplest N-body computation.

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:51.210
It's known as a brute-force method, and it involves separately calculating the force between each pair of elements

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.145
and then adding up the resulting forces on each element.

00:00:54.145 --> 00:00:57.251
A simulation using N-body will usually have two steps.

00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:03.490
First, compute the forces on each element, then move each element a little bit based on its force, and then repeat.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.259
So we first want to understand the complexity of this approach.

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.164
So we have N objects, each of which computes the forces on it from each other object.

00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:15.342
For N objects, what is the work complexity of computing all-pairs N-body?

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:19.342
Is the amount of work proportional to N, N log N, N squared, or N cubed?
