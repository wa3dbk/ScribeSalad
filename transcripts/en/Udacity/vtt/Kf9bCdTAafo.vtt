00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.380
Now an application, such as Google Earth, sits at

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.230
the top of the hierarchy. And it's code for

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.910
tracking the mouse movement on the screen, written in

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.380
whatever high level language is compiled into the instruction

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.530
set and traverses the rest of the hierarchy and

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.940
magic happens on the screen. Now within this hierarchy,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.870
the operating system acts as a broker between the

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.700
application at the top. And the physical resources such

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.950
as CPU, memory, and IO devices, can provide an app,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.730
with all it needs, for its successful and safe execution.
