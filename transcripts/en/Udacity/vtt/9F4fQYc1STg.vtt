00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.780
Now that we've discussed how to choose a pattern. Imagine that

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.210
you have to write a class that can have only one

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.090
instance. So to satisfy this requirement, I would like for you

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.720
to pick one of the design patterns that we discussed in

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.580
this lesson, and write the code here that satisfies that requirement.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.270
And when you write the code, please make sure that your

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.140
class has only one method, without counting possible constructors, and that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.120
the class is called Singleton. And write your class right here.
