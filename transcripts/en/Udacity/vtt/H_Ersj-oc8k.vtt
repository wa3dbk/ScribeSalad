00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.918
So the average program is in better shape than it was at first. It can now take

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:07.005
averages that include zero, but it still chokes when the user doesn't enter

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:11.750
enough numbers. What we would really want would be to print out an error if the

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.230
user enters no numbers and count to zero. So, when we run our program, it would

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.926
ask us to enter a value, and if we enter a bad value like s, it would say

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:26.146
error, no input. But if we enter values like we did before, it'll calculate the

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:30.651
average. Fix the average class, so that it prints out a sensible error, if

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:33.030
count ends up at zero.
