00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.960
SImilarly, let's go through some commands that you can run on

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.150
remote repositories. First command is the command to copy a repository,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.840
which is git clone in which you get a remote repository and you make a lot of

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.850
copy in your working directory. The repository can be specified as a URL.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.230
It can be a local file, it can be specified using the HTTP or

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.070
the SSH protocol, and there's also other ways to do it.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.300
This creates a complete local copy of the repository, as it says, and links it

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.030
to the remote repository, which is what is called the origin. And if you want,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.400
you could also actually link to the repository, later. Then the normal way of

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.800
receiving changes from a repository is to perform a git pull command. And we saw

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.345
that you can also perform the same operation through two commands, get fetch and

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:47.210
git merge. In case you want to inspect the changes before actually merging them,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.550
before actually getting them in your local copy. And

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.940
if you want to send changes that you have in your local repository to

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.680
a remote repository, you will use the git push command.
