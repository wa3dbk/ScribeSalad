Right now, we have that log base 2 of x is equal to log base 10 of x over log

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.430
base 10 of 2. But there's another way that we can rewrite this that I think

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.309
could help us out. Instead, we could write 1 over log base 10 of 2 times log

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.420
base 10 of x. Now, what can we say about the value of 1 over log base 10 of 2?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.619
Does it change, or is it constant?
