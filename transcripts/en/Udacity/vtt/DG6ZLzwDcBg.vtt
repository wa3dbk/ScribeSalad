00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.690
Now you have some useful
parallel tree algorithms.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.210
One is built on top of
work optimal lists.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.360
And the other on the rate
compressed framework for

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.740
evaluating expression trees.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.960
Now before wrapping up the lesson,
I wanted to point out one of the neat

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.080
ideas common to these methods, which
is the idea of linearizing the tree.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.530
Why is that cool?

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.590
Well linearizing helps you achieve load
balance which is what you need to make

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.130
a practical parallel algorithm scale.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.980
As an analogy imagine that
I gave you a pretzel and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.770
I asked you to cut it up
into say seven equal pieces.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.350
Like leaving the house and forgetting
to put on your pants, it's awkward.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.290
But if you unroll the pretzel
back into a line,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.660
it becomes much easier to measure
out into equal sized parts.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.720
Though I know what you're thinking,
it will be a lot more fun to just

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.290
eat the pretzel,um.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.570
That is delicious pretzel.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.360
I doesn't taste like rubber at all.
