00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.820
Here the solution to our equation is 2. Great work if you got that one orrect.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.700
Now if you didn't quite know how to handle this four let's see how to do it,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.332
then you can pause the video once you figure out and then continue solving. To

00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:16.784
start we'll square both sides of the equation so we can undo the square root.

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:21.068
We square 4 which equals 16, and then we square the radical which gives us the

00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:28.375
x minus 1. Just this radicant. On the right side we square the binomial 8 minus

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:34.115
2x. This gives us this polynomial. We'll distribute the 16 on the left side of

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:39.050
the equation to get 16x minus 16. On the right-hand side, I'll just re-arrange

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.249
the position of these two terms so I have my x squared term first. We'll have

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:51.280
4x squared, since it's positive, negative 32x, and positive 64, or plus 64.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.814
Next we want to set our equation equal to 0, so we subtract 16x from both

00:00:54.814 --> 00:01:01.449
sides. And we add 16 to both sides. We do this since we know we'll get 0 on the

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.528
left, and this polynomial on the right. We'll have a quadratic that we can try

00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:10.806
and factor. All of these terms have a common factor of four, so we can divide

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:16.814
out our equation by that factor. We'll have 0 equals x squared minus 12x plus

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:22.732
20. Next, we find factors of positive 20 that sum to negative 12. These factors

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:27.390
are negative 10, and negative two. We set each factor equal to 0, so x can

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.730
equal 10 or x can equal 2. And finally, we check x equals 10, and x equals 2,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.660
and the original equation. When we do this, we see that 10 does not check, we

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.910
get 12 equal to negative 12. So this one is not going to be part of our

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.300
solution set. However, for 2, it does check, so this must be our only solution.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.524
So don't worry if you stumbled at the beginning with squaring this 4, if you

00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:54.281
are able to finish it out, great work.
