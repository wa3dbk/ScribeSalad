00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.800
We want the FetchWeatherTask to return an array

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.520
of string forecasts. That means we need to

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.380
modify the return type of the async task.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.630
Then in the doInBackground method, after we've read

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.390
in the input string, we perform this code.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.200
We call the helper method getWeatherDataFromJson and we

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.660
pass in the forecastJson string as well as

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.475
the number of forecast days. We also catch

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:30.180
any Json exceptions if there's a problem with parsing. We

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.080
wanted to verify that the string array of forecast data

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.960
is correct. So, within the getWeatherDataFromJson method, we added some

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.720
logging statements to print out each element of the array.
