00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.580
You know, it's really hard to make a drawing stand out,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.050
if it's only in black and white.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.710
We can change the colors of fills and

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.190
strokes by using these two, fillStyle and strokeStyle.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.600
We can call fillStyle on the canvas context and in this case,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.200
we're going to set it to blue.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.620
You can use a name color.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.730
There are a 140 name colors, according to the HTML specification.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.970
And you can learn more about them in the instructor notes.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.110
Or you can use a hexadecimal color.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.940
So in this case we're setting the stroke style color to 33CC33.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.660
And we're calling it on the canvas.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.860
Hopefully these two should add some color to our drawing over here.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.940
Let's find out.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.320
I will save it.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.620
I will come over here and hit Refresh.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.730
And we see that in fact the fill actually did become blue.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.910
Our triangle is now blue, which is pretty cool,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.850
but it looks like strokeStyle here didn't have an effect.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.790
This hexadecimal color should be a shade of green, but

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.700
we don't see any green over.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.880
And that's because, fillStyle and strokeStyle.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.150
Only applied to the fills and strokes that come after them, inside your script.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.840
So in this case because we're calling fill,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.420
after we set fillStyle, we have a nice blue triangle.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.510
But because we drew our stroke rectangle,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.180
well before we set the strokeStyle it didn't get affected.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.450
Let's go ahead and change that.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.950
So now we set the strokeStyle to this color before the rectangle.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.400
And we should see green rectangle instead.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.700
So let's save our script, come over to the browser and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.240
hit Refresh, and now the rectangle has a nice, light green outline.
