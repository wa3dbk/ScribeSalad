00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.960
If we zoom in on our terminal buttons, this is what we'll see. The joining of

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.928
the terminal buttons with the neighboring neuron is called the synapse. It

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:13.930
causes the release of a neurotransmitter. When the electrical impulse reaches

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.684
the terminal button, where all the neurotransmitters are. It causes a release

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:23.490
of the neurotransmitters into what we call the synaptic cleft. At this point,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.520
the electrical impulse stimulates a chemical change, which releases the

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.761
neurotransmitters. The transmitters carry the signal across the synaptic cleft

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:39.094
to the next neuron. Finally the neurotransmitters reach the receptor sites that

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:44.517
only allow in particular kinds of neurochemicals, so it has to be a match. And

00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:49.057
then the process starts all over again. Down the dendrite, through the soma,

00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:53.611
down the axon, through the terminal buttons in the synapse and then reaches the

00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:58.349
next neuron. This is the basis of how nerve cells communicate.
