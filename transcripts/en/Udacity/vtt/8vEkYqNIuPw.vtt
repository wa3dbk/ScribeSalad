00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.790
When you write code as part of a team, picking good class and method names

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.473
makes it possible to work together. When I pick good names for my classes, it

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:10.788
makes it easier for other engineers I'm working with, to read my code, and know

00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:16.059
what it does. It also makes it easier for me to remember what I did. So, this

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.940
process is important, but how do you get good at it? The answer is practice.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.408
Lots of practice. Keep writing code, and when you read code, ask yourself, what

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:30.265
patterns does this code follow to make it easier to read. Or, what patterns

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:35.392
could this code have followed to make it easier to read. These questions will

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:38.594
be very hard to answer, at first. But as you critique more examples, it'll

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:43.014
become more natural. We'll talk about a few more patterns in this lesson. But

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:47.889
for now, let's do another example of designing class and method names.
