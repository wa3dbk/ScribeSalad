00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Very surprisingly, the resulting Gaussian

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is more certain than the two component Gaussians.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That is, the covariance is smaller than either of the two covariances in isolation.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Intuitively speaking, this is the case because we actually gain information.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The two Gaussians together have a higher information content

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
than either Gaussian in isolation. It'll look something like this.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That is completely not obvious.

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You might have to take this with faith, but I can actually prove it to you.
