00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.140
We're glad you're back.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.850
In the last lesson you practiced
building better inputs.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.880
You practiced picking
the right input types.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.430
You enabled autofill.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.750
You added clickable labels and
you validated inputs.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.420
&gt;&gt; Now it's time to take a step back
from perfecting individual input and

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.660
start thinking about designing
better forms made of many inputs.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.200
This lesson is particularly
important for e-commerce,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.950
where better forms means more sales.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is really,
really important.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.510
And take a look at PayPal's
ridiculous rise in mobile payments.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.660
I think it makes sense that this
lesson also focuses on creating great

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.980
mobile experiences.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.240
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.600
Luckily, there are a few basic
principles everyone can follow

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.470
to build better forms on every platform.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.670
And they also apply well
outside of e-commerce.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.460
Your ultimate goal is to minimize
the amount of time your user spends

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.420
filling out forms.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.810
&gt;&gt; In this lesson, you'll practice
techniques to make forms mentally

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.800
easier for your users to handle.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.630
And at the end of the lesson,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.850
you'll be given two ugly,
nasty forms with low conversion rates.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.570
It'll be your job to apply best
practices to improve the forms and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.410
boost conversion rates.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.200
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.750
Let's go.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go.
