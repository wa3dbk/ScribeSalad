00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.000
In the box below, input a CSS selector that will

correctly select the top nav bar of the page.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.160

And there may be many ways to select this element due to the flexibility of CSS

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.160
selectors, but any selector that correctly selects the navbar is fine.
