00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right. The question was which of these five strings are in the language of this grammar.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The first one looks pretty good. I just apply rule 1.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
P goes to open P close and then rule two to get rid of the P, and I'm in like Flynn.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
How about this? Well, I'm going to apply rule one twice.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll end up with open open P close close, and then I'll use rule two to get rid of the P.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Similarly, over here I'm going to apply rule one three times.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Open open open P close close close.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then I'll apply rule two to get rid of the P.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Totally in the language of our grammar.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But this--tsk, tsk, tsk--this is going to be problematic.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Just an open parenthesis.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you look over here, there's actually no way to make just a lonely open parenthesis

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that does not have a matching close parenthesis.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There's only one rule that introduces the open parenthesis,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and it makes just as many close parentheses at the same time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This cannot happen. Here this looks good.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
These parentheses match, open close open close,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but if you take a look at this grammar, there is never a way to have an open after a close.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I can apply this rule as many times as I want in this pattern,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but I'm never going to end up making something like this--not as written.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We could write a grammar for this, but not currently shown.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This sort of system is known a balanced parentheses.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The parentheses are balanced, because the number on the left equals the number on the right.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
One to one, two to two, three to three.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In fact, you could imagine some sort of scale that'd have to be exactly equal--

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
two openings, two closings. Balanced parentheses.

00:01:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is a super-important problem in computer science.
