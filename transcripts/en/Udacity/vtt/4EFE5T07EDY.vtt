00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.390
Finally, there's IndexedDB.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.680
It's fast, allows you to store complex
data, asynchronous and transactional.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.000
And it's essentially
available everywhere.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.068
It's likely the best fit for
any important user data.

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:19.780
The biggest drawback to using
IndexedDB is its ugly API,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.420
with lots of setup required and
call backs to handle.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.030
There are a few good repro libraries
out there that will obstruct away

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.750
some of the ugliness.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.390
Mozilla has published localForage,
which provides a local storage like API.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.950
Or Lovefield,
which provides SQL-like APIs.
