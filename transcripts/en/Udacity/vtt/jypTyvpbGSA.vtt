00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.812
These are the classes that I came up with. There's a manager and photographers,

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:09.974
assignments and a portfolio or maybe multiple portfolios. The manager is

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:13.736
responsible for labelling or prioritizing and photographers are completing

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:18.148
assignments. So I think the manager has a method something like prioritizing

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:21.620
the assign that takes in a new assignment and figures out what to do with it,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.354
and photographers have probably a method complete assignment. Thinking about

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:31.383
the methods that an assignment has, might be a little harder. Mostly, an

00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:35.454
assignment should have a priority and a description. So it will probably be

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:39.797
possible to set the priority of an assignment. We'll also probably need to be

00:00:39.797 --> 00:00:43.242
able to get the priorities, or compare them, so that the manager can figure out

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:49.375
which ones are the highest priority assignments. Maybe when an assignment is

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:53.980
finished, something happens with it. The portfolio probably needs to be able to

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.030
collect the finished assignments, and there should be a way to look at the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.678
finish assignments as well. There are they things that you could have written

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:04.584
here, it's possible that customer would also be a good class or may be

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:08.881
priority. This would depend on how complicated you wanted to make your

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.010
priorities
