00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:03.378
So what we learned last week was that scan can be computed efficiently

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:06.843
on n elements with run time proportion to n.

00:00:06.843 --> 00:00:12.082
And we also learned that it can be completed with a number of steps proportional to log n.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:15.273
This is something we can implement very efficiently on the GPU.

00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:17.836
And because we can implement it efficiently, what we'll find today

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:21.738
is that it's the core of a significant number of interesting parallel parameters.

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:24.114
And we're going to start with one called compact.
