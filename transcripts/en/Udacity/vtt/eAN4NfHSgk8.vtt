00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.845
Let's round these values to the nearest 100's for the rest of this example, now

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:09.176
let's calculate the T statistic, remember that the T statistic is x bar or

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:16.116
sample mean minus meu the population mean. And really we can compare x bar to

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:20.456
anything, but we are choosing to compare it to the population mean to see if

00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:24.936
things have changed and then we divide by the standard error as divided by the

00:00:24.936 --> 00:00:28.933
square root of n.
