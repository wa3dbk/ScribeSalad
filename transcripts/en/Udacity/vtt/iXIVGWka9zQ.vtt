00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.390
So, to look up algorithm, that a router

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.900
uses, depends on the protocol that it's using to

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.720
forward packets. And the look up mechanism might be

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.130
implemented with a variety of different algorithms or techniques.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.610
For example, MPLS, ethernet, and ATM use an

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.680
exact match look up. Exact matches can be implemented

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.350
as a direct look up, and associative look up,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.510
hashing, or via a binary tree. IPv4 and IPv6

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.320
on the other hand are implemented with what's called longest prefix

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.450
match. We've already looked at longest prefix match a little bit

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.150
in some lessons and, in this lesson we'll look at it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.790
in a bit more detail as well as how it's implemented.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.250
It might be implemented as a radix trie, a compressed trie.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.340
Which is something that we will look at in this lesson.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.430
And it can also be implemented as a binary search on

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.560
the prefix intervals. Ethenet based forwarding is based on exact match

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.500
of a layer two address. Which is usually 48

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.390
bits long. It's address is global, not just local to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.830
the link. And the range or size of the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.760
address is not negotiable. Now 2 to the 48th is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.260
far bigger than 2 to the 12th, therefore, it's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.250
not possible to hold all the addresses in the table

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.870
and use direct look up. The advantages of exact matches

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.120
and ethernet switches, is that exact match is simple and

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.230
the expected lookup time is small, or O of 1.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.060
But the disadvantages include inefficient

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.370
use of memory. This potentially results

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.000
in nondeterministic lookup time if the lookup might require multiple memory

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.500
accesses. let's now take a closer look at longest prefix match.
