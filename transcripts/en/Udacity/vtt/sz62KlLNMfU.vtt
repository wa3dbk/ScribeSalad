Hopefully now the way that we modified this equation for our line earlier makes

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:08.614
a little bit more sense. Remember that we had y minus t equals m times x minus

00:00:08.614 --> 00:00:12.995
s. But what does this really mean? Let's think back to what we called different

00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:17.219
parts of our line, or different characteristics of our line, when we created

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.803
this equation. Well, this t was our y coordinate of the point that we knew. So

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:25.899
this left hand side of the equation really says y minus the y coordinate and on

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.733
the right side, m was our slope and s was our x coordinate. So we've just

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.500
derived another way to work out the equation of the line. That's pretty

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.802
impressive. This is really incredible that you guys did this yourself. Now, any

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:41.597
time that we know the coordinates of a point on a line s and t, or the x

00:00:41.597 --> 00:00:45.669
coordinate and the y coordinate. And we know the slope of the line, we can

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:50.301
automatically write that line's equation. This is a super, super powerful tool.

00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:54.568
However, I'm lazy, and writing it out this way is really time consuming. But

00:00:54.568 --> 00:00:58.655
writing it in the original way doesn't really show us what s and t actually

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:03.816
stand for. It's a little bit Less clear what the meaning of these letters is.

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:08.968
Let's see what we can do about this. Instead of calling our point here s, t I

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:13.948
think we should call it x1, y1. That way whenever we use these terms in the

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:19.052
equation we know what kind of values they are. We know whatever is in the place

00:01:19.052 --> 00:01:23.702
of x1 is going to be an x coordinate and whatever is in the place of y1 is going

00:01:23.702 --> 00:01:28.514
to be a y coordinate. So that updates this equation. Remember that y and x here

00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:33.324
are general variables, but x1 and y1 will be the fixed values that we pick based

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:38.699
on a concrete point that we know. These values will vary. As we move up and down

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.995
the line. These values will stay fixed.
