00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.546
Well first we need to find the population standard deviation, which is about

00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:12.578
1.7078. And remember, our sample size is 2. So according to the center limit

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:18.970
theorem, this standard deviation of this distribution Is sigma divided by route

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.798
N which is one point seven zero seven eight, divided by the square of two and

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:30.394
this is about one point two zero seven six. It's okay if you round it. And you

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:35.017
can even find that yourself by brute force since the population only consists of

00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:40.222
six values. So you could take all samples, one, one, one two, one three, one

00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:45.355
four, one five, one six, two one, two, two, two three, two four, blah, blah,

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:50.836
blah and then you can find the mean of each sample of size two and then find the

00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:56.460
standard deviation. Of that data set, consisting of all the means, and you'll

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.812
get this number. But, we already know, because of the central limit theorem, we

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:07.416
can find this number just by dividing the population center deviation by root n.
