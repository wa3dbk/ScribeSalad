00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.795
So, why do we get such a small number for this calculation? Well, if you think

00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:07.585
way back to when we did exponent notation at the beginning of the course, we

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:12.472
talked about negative exponents and what they are. x to the negative 1 means 1

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:18.260
divided by x. x to the negative 2 means 1 over x squared. So if we multiply

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.548
something by x to the negative 1, we really want to divide that by x. And if we

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:26.788
multiply something by x to the negative 2, we really want to divide it by x

00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:31.884
squared. So if we multiply something by 10 to the negative 4, what we really

00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:36.907
want to do is divide it by 10 to the 4th. With multiplication by 10 to the

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:41.870
positive 4, the answer we got was bigger than the number we started with. But,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.192
when we divide by 10th to the 4, it gets smaller. For each factor of 10 we're

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:52.082
dividing by, the decimal point moves one step to the left. So, we start with

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:59.054
3.1, then 1 factor of 10 makes it 0.31 and we keep moving it. As before, we end

00:00:59.054 --> 00:01:04.244
up with these blank spots, we need to fill in zeros. Our decimal point is right

00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:09.192
here now. So what we actually have is, as we saw before, 0.00031. Now, note

00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:16.149
that I put a 0 in front of our decimal point, to the left of it. Now this is

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.439
the technically correct way to write decimal numbers in general. If you miss

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.678
out on writing this, it's kind of like using slang for everyday speech. People

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:29.012
will still know what you mean but its not quite as correct. Its not quite as

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:32.974
proper in mathematics. So now that we've seen one example of using a negative

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:37.368
exponent in scientific notation, I'm going to give you another one to try out.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:42.933
Here is 3.1 times 10 to the negative 7. This time try without using a

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:47.099
calculator to write this in normal number notation.
