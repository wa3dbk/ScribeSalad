00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.190
There are other ways of drawing with the canvas as well and

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.040
I'm going to go ahead and demonstrate one right here.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.750
It begins with this command,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.210
BeginPath which we're calling on the context of the campus.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.420
BeginPath tells the canvas that we're about to draw a new shape.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.350
Then we use this command MoveTo.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.680
Now with moveTo and LineTo it makes actually a lot of sense to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.865
think about a pen actually moving on page.

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:26.260
MoveTo moves a pen to a specific location on the canvas which is designated by

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.300
the x and y coordinate here.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.370
So this command moves the pen to 10, 10 which is going to be about right here.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.810
You can think of move to as just moving the pen but

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.770
the pen isn't making a mark yet.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.940
We're just deciding where we want to put it down on the page.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.800
But then when we call LineTo we actually put the pen down.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.850
And make his mark or in this case align to this position.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.750
So this line here with MoveTo 10,10.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.270
Moves the pen or hovers it over 10,10.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.120
Then when we call LineTo, we put the pen down and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.600
then move it to the position of 50, 50.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.560
Then we move it again and move it again.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.860
If we refresh the page we'll see that there's nothing there

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.260
despite the fact that it looks like we made a shape that eventually goes back to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.890
where we started at 10, 10.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.930
That's because we need to call either a fill or

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.050
a stroke command to finish up this path.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.860
Let's start by doing fill.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.920
I will go ahead and uncomment this line and save, come over here and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.280
hit Refresh.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.550
And we see that we create a filled shape.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.350
This made a triangle, so now we see a filled in triangle.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.230
If we comment in fill and then un-comment stroke, let's see what happens.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.480
We'll save.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.420
Come over here and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.220
hit Refresh and now we see a stroke triangle that's not filled in.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.040
There are many other drawing commands that you can use in the canvas and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910
check out the link in the instructor notes if you want to learn more about them.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.600
But most of them behave similarly to what we see here.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.200
For this quiz we want you to recreate the shape that you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.330
see here with the canvas.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.870
I've gone ahead and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.080
marked a few points on the outside square and the inside triangle.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.370
This should make your life a little bit easier as you try to recreate it.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.410
After you've finished it, check this box to continue.
