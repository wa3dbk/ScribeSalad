00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.299
And the answer is no, we're not done yet. We have reached a goal state.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:12.199
We put a path onto the frontier that reaches the goal of Bucharest, but we haven't popped that path off the frontier.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.766
And uniform cost search continues to search until we pop it off the frontier.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:20.799
We continue looking to see if there's a better path that also reaches the goal.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.399
So let's see. I forgot to say Thagoras is explored, so let's continue.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.232
Let's take the cheapest path on the frontier and expand that.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:38.666
The cheapest path is this, 146. We'll expand that, get another path into (Sibiyu).

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:43.066
That's a worse path than we had before, so we'll drop it.

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:50.932
Then let's see what's next. Looking on the frontier, the cheapest now is here at 299.

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:56.332
We'll expand that. We get a path of cost 374.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:00.032
Put that on the frontier. Now let's go again.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:04.965
Now the cheapest path is over here at 317.

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:12.132
We'll mark that as explored and add two more paths--one here that's a worse path, so it gets dropped.

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:21.332
And one path that also reaches the goal, and that has a total cost of 418.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:27.499
So that just shows it's a good thing we waited, a good thing we didn't stop when we found the first path to the goal,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.599
because now this second path found is actually cheaper than the first path found.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.499
But we're not going to stop here because we still haven't popped off a path that reaches the goal.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.966
So we'll continue. What's next? Now the cheapest path on the frontier is here at 366.

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:52.599
We expand that, and we get paths that are worse paths to points we've already seen before.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.232
So nothing new goes on the frontier. Next, the cheapest path on the frontier is at 374.

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:06.799
Again, expanding that leads nothing useful. Only worse paths than we've seen before.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.232
And now finally, the cheapest path on the frontier is this 418 path to Bucharest,

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:18.899
so we pop that off, and now we reach the goal, and now we stop.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.399
So even though we found the 460 path first, we don't stop there because there might be another path

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.399
that also reaches the goal that's cheaper. We keep on going until we popped a path off of the frontier that reaches the goal,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.000
and that's why uniform cost search is guaranteed to find the cheapest path to the goal.
