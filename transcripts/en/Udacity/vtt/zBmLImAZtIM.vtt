00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.990
Suppose we're creating
a chat application,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.430
where we have a list
of available friends.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.370
Our array might look
something like this.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.940
We want to use Ruby to print out
the name of each friend in the array.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.530
If we only have five friends online,
it's not too bad.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.930
But what if we have 500 friends online,
or 1000 friends?

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.070
Wow, that's a lot of repeated code.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.860
Fortunately, there's a better
way to do this, loops.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.690
Loops are a feature built into Ruby that
helps us reduce code duplication and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.700
let's us repeat things.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.640
In this session,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.979
we'll learn about some of the important
loops that Ruby ships with.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.230
And by the end of this session, we'll
see a few ways to take these 500 plus

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.220
lines of code and reduce it down
to this beautiful single line.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.440
All right, let's get started.
