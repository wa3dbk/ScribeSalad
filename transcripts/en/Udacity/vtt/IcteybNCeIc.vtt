00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.789
What we find here is almost a little interpretation of the equations.

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:08.709
However, it's important to notice we compute h new as a modification of h

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.707
but only use h in the implementation of Heun's method up here.

00:00:12.707 --> 00:00:16.799
We might run into some difficulties if the numerical error becomes really, really tiny

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:20.689
because then as you can see right here in the computation of h new, we're dividing by the error

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.629
and that would basically make us end up dividing by zero.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.739
So one option to prevent this from happening would be to divide

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.478
not just by the error but by the error plus some really small number.

00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:33.660
Another precautionary measure that we might want to take would be

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.619
to limit the range of possible values of the step size.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.779
So if we do that, then here's what happens.

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:45.489
If h is smaller than 0.1, then the maximum becomes 0.1 and eventually you'll end up with a value of 0.1.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.789
Now if time gets larger than 1800, then the minimum becomes 1800

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.678
and the new step size becomes 1800 since it limits the range of h new to be between 0.1 and 1800.

00:00:58.678 --> 00:01:00.749
Now let's look at the output.

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.738
So we can see that the program takes huge steps along its trajectory

00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:06.739
and keep in mind that these steps are not at regular time intervals

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:10.788
because they represent the steps that we're taking with adaptive step size.

00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:14.619
So time interval down here is much smaller than the time interval up here.

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.618
One last thing that we can notice here is that the very first step size is small

00:01:18.618 --> 00:01:23.619
because we initially set h to 100 seconds and then the method automatically chooses the larger one

00:01:23.619 --> 09:59:59.000
as you can see right here and then it keeps that larger one, although of course it does change.
