There are two reasons why conformity may occur, they are informational social

00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:09.770
influence and normative social influence. Let's start with the informational

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.616
social influence. This happens when people conform to the behavior of others

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:16.964
because they view the other people as a source of knowledge regarding what

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:22.040
they're supposed to do or how they're supposed to act. Have you ever found

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.319
yourself in a new situation and were unsure of how to act or what to do? Did

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.982
you look to others to see how they were behaving? Well this is an example of

00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:34.457
informational social influence. Consider a freshman starting college, the

00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:37.544
person may look around to see how other people are behaving in the lunchroom

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:41.840
for example. Do people take their food off their trays to eat, do they keep

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.574
their food on their trays? Do they mostly sit outside, do they sit inside this

00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:53.330
usually happens in situations that are ambiguous, or in a novel situation.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.020
That's when we are most likely to see the informational social influence occur.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.375
The next influence on our behavior will be quite obvious when you stop and

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:05.870
think about some examples in your own life. This is normative social influence,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.298
and it explains a lot of our behavior. For example, do you dress similarly to

00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:15.028
your friends? Do you listen to the same type of music as your friends? Have you

00:01:15.028 --> 00:01:19.524
ever tried drugs or alcohol to be accepted by a particular social group? Well

00:01:19.524 --> 00:01:23.052
if you've changed your behavior in order to gain acceptance by a particular

00:01:23.052 --> 00:01:26.580
social group, social psychologists would say that this is due to normative

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.989
social influence.
