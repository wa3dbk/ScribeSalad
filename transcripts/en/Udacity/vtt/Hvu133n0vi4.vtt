The two lines of code needed are one to create the texture, the other to set

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.260
the materials specular map to this texture. You might try changing the specular

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.655
map to map which sets the diffuse map instead. The effect is considerably

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:12.852
different.
