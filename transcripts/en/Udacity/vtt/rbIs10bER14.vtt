Points and vectors don't require any numbers to be associated with them. For

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:08.912
example, I can say, define a vector from the Andromeda galaxy to Chicago. That

00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:12.943
vector now exists, but doesn't have any coordinates until I define a frame of

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:17.000
reference of some sort. I could ask, what are the vectors coordinates in terms

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.919
of the Earth's latitude, longitude, and altitude? That gives one set of

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.868
coordinates, the one that changes every second as the Earth rotates. Or I could

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:30.026
ask, what are the coordinates in terms of the Sun's location and the Earth's

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:34.444
path, and get coordinates that change more slowly. Whenever we assign a point or

00:00:34.444 --> 00:00:38.732
a vector a coordinate value, it's always with respect to some frame of reference

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:43.303
we've defined. In 3D computer graphics, we usually talk about the location and

00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:48.001
movement of objects, lights and cameras, in terms of world space. This frame of

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:52.712
reference is usually right handed. You can define units for it if you like, such

00:00:52.712 --> 00:00:56.893
as 1 unit equals 1 meter. Or it can be unitless, if there's no need for them.
