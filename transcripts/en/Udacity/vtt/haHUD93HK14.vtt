00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.620
You can see from the graph, there is a maximum point here at 3.5 comma negative

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.387
4. Is it a global or relative maximum? Well, it's certainly not a global

00:00:09.387 --> 00:00:13.322
maximum. As all of these points over to the left and to the right pass the

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:17.970
asymptotes, are above it. That means it is a relative maximum.
