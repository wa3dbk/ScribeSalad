00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
The correct answer is, if we know the optimization version to be tractable,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.630
then the decision version is also tractable.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.800
If we know it to be intractable, then the decision version is also intractable.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.240
The same goes if we have the information about the decision version.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.520
You see, the tractability of an optimization version

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.680
and of a decision version are closely related.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.690
Now, two of these answers I think are more obvious than two others ones.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.850
I think the answer to question #1 is rather obvious because if the optimization version is tractable

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.420
so you can find the best possible solution in polynomial time,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.430
then with that solution you can also very easily answer a yes or no question about the solution.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.730
The same thing is true I think for answer #4 because if the decision version is intractable

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.850
then the optimization version also has to be intractable or if you could easily solve

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.990
the optimization version then it would also be easy to answer a yes or no question about the solution.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.680
The answers to question #2 and #3 I think are a little bit less obvious.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.460
If you know the optimization version to be intractable, then of course it could be the case that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.800
just having to say yes or no given the size of the solution that you're looking for

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.380
could be easier, that could be tractable.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.390
So you would have to show in some way that if the decision version were tractable,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.290
then the optimization version would also be easy to solve,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.360
which is basically what I've asked you to think about in question #3 here.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.670
One way to show this is and this is not very precise but just to give you an idea here that

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.550
if you have a tractable decision version then you could ask multiple questions

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.050
about the solution and still remain in polynomial time.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.110
So for example if you're looking for the best possible solution for vertex cover,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.400
you could first ask the decision version say for n/2 as the value of k you're looking for

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.710
and see if you can find a solution of this size.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.070
If that is the case, you can decrease k or if you cannot find a solution that is that small

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.410
then you have to increase k and by solving the decision version often enough

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.199
so searching for that optimum k you can also solve the optimization version.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:14.770
So this is not that obvious to see but for now you can keep in mind that optimization versions

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.230
of a problem and decision versions of a problem behave more or less the same

00:02:19.230 --> 99:59:59.000
with respect to tractability or intractability.
