00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's take a look at what we've done inside a redraw meme.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.430
First things first, we need to draw the image.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.270
We check to see if the image exists by making sure it's not null, and

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.460
then we use context.draw image to draw the image inside the canvas.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.329
Then we start creating our text attributes.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.780
Just like before, we set a font, we align it to center, we set the strokes to

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.840
black with a width of three, and then set the fills to white.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.390
At this point,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.790
we could start drawing text, which is exactly what we start doing here.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.880
We want to make sure we have a top line and

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.640
if we do, we draw the fill text first and then the stroke text.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.110
Notice that we're using the same canvas.width over two trick that we did before.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.360
This makes sure that the text shows up at the center of the Then we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.980
do the same thing with the bottom text.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.840
The only difference between the top text and the bottom text is the y position.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.570
Here we have y position at 40 pixels which is towards the top.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.820
And then for the y position at the bottom, we're going to select the canvas

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.480
height and then just subtract 20 pixels from it.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.360
Remember, the canvas height here is going to be a big number, but

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.060
the y coordinates get bigger the farther down you go.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.160
So this makes sense.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.770
This makes us 20 pixels above the bottom of the canvas.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.360
And with that, we should be good to go.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360
Let's take a look.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.470
Okay, I've got the meme generator over here.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.570
Let's go ahead and open a file.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.890
And I've got myself as the background.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.360
I'll set the top text to CAM BE LIKE.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.940
And let's say the bottom text is going to say, I don't know, CANVAS IS AWESOME.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.330
Let's go ahead and hit save, and see if that works.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.000
And yeah, we've got our image to save.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.260
I will right click, save image as, and put it on the desktop.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.950
And with that, we've got our simple meme maker.
