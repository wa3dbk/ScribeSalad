00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.040
Since we've talked about several situations now that involve two different

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.820
variables or two quantities that we might want to relate to one another in an

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.725
equation. I think we should review what equations with two variables really

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:17.148
mean. Now, I gave you this exact quiz way, way back in Lesson 5-1. But looking

00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:21.730
at it again might refresh our memories a bit. So, what can an equation with two

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.230
variables do? Can it describe mathematical relationship between two variables?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.433
Can it show the output for a given input? Can it show how changing one quantity

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:34.766
changes another quantity? Or can it demonstrate cause and effect? Please pick as

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.456
many of these answers as you think are correct.
