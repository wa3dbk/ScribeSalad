00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:03.880
The secret sauce that makes this dynamic relation between

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.500
the client and the server possible is this mechanism

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.028
called subcontract. It's sort of like the real life

00:00:11.028 --> 00:00:13.422
analogy of off loading work to a third party,

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:15.879
you know, you give sub contract to somebody to

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.890
get some work done. That's the same analogy that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.080
is being used here, in the structure of the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.460
Spring network operating system. I mentioned earlier, that the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.200
contract between the client and the server is

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.280
established thru the IDL. That is the Interface

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.790
Description language, used to create the contract between

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.600
the client and the server. And the subcontract is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.330
the interface that is provided for realizing the

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.650
IDL contract between the client and the server. So

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.710
here is the IDL interface and the client

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.860
is using the server's IDL interface to make invocation

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.010
calls on the server. An implementation of this

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.655
IDL interface is accomplished through the Subcontract mechanism.

00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:01.380
Put differently, subcontract is a mechanism to hide

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.519
the runtime behavior of an object from the

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.770
actual interface. For instance, there could be a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.390
singleton implementation of the server, or it could

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.980
be a replicated implementation of the server. The

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.130
client does not care, and does not know.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.400
And all of the detail of how this client's IDL interface is satisfied is in the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.430
details of the sub contract itself. So what

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.860
that means is, the client side stub generation

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.320
becomes very simple because all of the detail

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.250
of where the server is. How to access

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.130
the server? Whether the server is on the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.790
same machine or on a different machine and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.200
are there multiple copies of the server? Which copy of

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.480
the server should I go to? All of those details are

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.110
in the subcontract mechanism. That makes the life of client

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.530
side stub generation very, very simple. So subcontract lives under the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.780
covers of the IDL contract and you can change the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.700
subcontract at any time. So, for instance, if you don't like

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.550
the work being done by one contractor, you give it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.020
to a different subcontract. Same sort of thing that can happen

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.330
here is that the subcontract is something

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.760
that you can discover and install at runtime.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.430
So, in other words, you can dynamically load

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.090
new subcontracts. For instance, if a singleton server

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.320
got replicated, then you get a new sub-contract

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.450
that corresponds to this replicated server, so that

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.160
now you can access the replicated servers using

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.330
the subcontract. And nothing needs to change above

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.350
this line. The client stub doesn't have to do

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.006
anything differently. All of the details are handled by this

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:42.450
subcontract, seamlessly. So in other words, you can seamlessly

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.260
add functionality, to existing services, using the sub contract mechanism.
