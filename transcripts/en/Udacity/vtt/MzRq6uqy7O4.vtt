00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] So here's a pictorial representation of a parse tree for HTML.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Remember that all parse trees always grow upside down,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we have our actual tokens at the leaves at the bottom

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because this is a web page that just says, "Hello friends," with no tags,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it has a large number of intermittent nodes corresponding to non-terminals

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or rewrite rules in our grammar.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We want to walk over this parse tree and decide based on all these intermediate nodes

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to print out to display on the screen as our web page Hello Friends.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That process is known as interpreting.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Walking over the tree to figure out what to do, and in some sense

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it's just like interpreting a sentence in English to figure out what it means

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or even translating a sentence from one language to another.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Recall that our 2 major elements in our syntax tree are represented in python as tuples.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Word elements just have 2 parts, the word word-hyphen element so that we know what's going on,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and then the actual text from the user, and tag elements which start with tag elements.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Again, to make it easier for us to interpret, we'll see that in just a minute.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The beginning tag, the ending tag, and then down here a list of other elements.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We also have a Java script element, which I haven't spent as much time talking about,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but is our way of representing embedded Java script pieces of code in a web page.

00:01:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We're going to focus on these 2 for now.
