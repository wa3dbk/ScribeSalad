00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why do you believe the future of programming language design lies in domain specific languages

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when we can just do operator overloading and APIs in a general language like C?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, that’s a tough question and actually there is a bit of philosophy or opinion here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In class, we keep brushing against Turing completeness, and it turns out that languages like

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
C++ or C# or Java or MATLAB are all going to allow us to express

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the same computations ultimately--that is,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
if it’s possible to do it in one language, it’s also possible to do it in the other,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but that doesn’t say anything about how easy it is, how much help the language

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
will give you about making mistakes, and how quick the final result will be.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In my opinion, three important features that the domain specific language gives you over just

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
coding up special types or operations in a general purpose language like C++ or C#

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
are the conciseness of the representation, the ability to do type checking or run-time checking

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or otherwise have safety built-in, and the ability of the compiler or run-time system to do optimization.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's take something like MATLAB, which is very good at doing mathematical operations

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
or matrices or matrix multiply in a concise manner, and take it as sort of a running example.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You could code up the same sorts of operations, matrix multiply,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and language like C or C++ and C#,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and you might start out by having them the functions that take a number of arguments

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in making your own data types.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And to that, it’s relatively clear that languages like MATLAB,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which just like to use the star to multiply two matrices, is going to be more concise.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
However, once you start adding operator overloading or feature of languages like

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
C++ or C# that allows you to change the meaning of symbols

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
like plus or stars that they, in essence, call functions you define.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Then, the conciseness argument is more of a wash sort of a tie for both ends.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
However, the other two aspects, type safety or type checking and optimization, are still really critical.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
A language specifically designed to handle Mathematics or matrices something like MATLAB

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is going to be able to notice potentially more easily

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
if you make mistakes related to that particular domain.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
For example, in C or C++, often a two-dimensional matrix in array

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is really just a single array carefully embedded.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
There's some sort of stride or approach where we reuse the elements of the indices

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
in a very long one-dimensional array as if it were a two-dimensional array.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And it is really easy to make mistakes to pass in arrays or matrices that have the wrong dimensions

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to matrix-matrix multiply, to confuse row major order and column major order, and language like

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
C or C++ depending on which matrix implementation you're using

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
won’t give you any support with that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It will silently let you shoot yourself in the foot. Compute the wrong answer.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You might not even crash. You might just get something you’re not expecting.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And that’s really problematic because these days the constraint is often

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
programmer time rather than CPU time.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I’d rather use a language where these things are built-in as first-class citizens,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and there’s the possibility that it will alert me to error.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Many of you may have a favorite C++ or C# or Java matrix library that would catch those errors.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Again, ultimately, since these languages have equivalent expressive power,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
you can add that sort of error checking to any language or library.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But often domain-specific languages do a better job at it. And the third example is then optimization.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The higher-level instructions you give to a compiler or interpreter,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the more scope it has for creativity,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
the more chances it has to reorder your statements or implement them in other way,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the closer you can get to just being declarative.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I want to multiply these matrices, and I don’t care how you do it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The more the compiler under the hood is able to take advantage of things like memory hierarchies,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
caches, special multimedia instructions you might have

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
in order to get that sort of thing done well under the hood.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
If you actually write out your matrix-matrix multiply as three nested for loops,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you’re forcing the compiler to generate code for that particular implementation.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Often domain specific languages allow you to express things like

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
matrix transposition or multiplication at a very high level.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And thus, they actually end up generating better code for new target architectures

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
than you might do if you were to code it up yourself.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So you end up spending less time writing. It’s concise.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
You get guarantees, and it’s faster.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And in fact, you can view the push to domain specific languages

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
as just an extension of the push from assembly languages to high level languages.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
One of the first arguments made in favor of higher level languages

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
were early studies in computer science that found that the number of lines of code

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that programmers could write per day essentially over the lifetime of a project

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
was constant regardless of what language you are using.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You could either pay your programmers and get ten lines of assembly

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
or you could pay your programmers and get ten lines of C or ten lines of Python or some such.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And if you have experience with multiple languages, typically you can get significantly

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
more done in ten lines of Python than you can in ten lines of assembly because of built-in support

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
for dictionaries or lambda, higher order data types, object-oriented programming, that sort of thing.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Ultimately, you can get everything done with assembly, but it would take longer.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
The same argument here applies to domain specific languages.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
If I have a new more exotic domain-specific language, let’s pick MacroLab.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
That's a favorite one of mine for programming wireless sensor networks

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
for moving data around and performing distributed computations.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Let’s say for example that you want to keep track of people passing through

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
your storefront advertising window to see if it’s actually working in attracting people.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
You might make up some sort of wireless sensor network to keeps track.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You want to write programs for that.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
You could do them and see your assembly language

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
or you could use this sort of domain specific language

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
since it has notions of distributed computation

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
where data lives, sending information back and forth, built-in as primitives.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It’s able to check mistakes for you, generate good code for you,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and in general, improve your productivity.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Could you get all of that done with a well-crafted library? Yes.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And in some sense, ultimately at the end of the day, maybe there is no difference between

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the well-crafted library and a domain specific language.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But I think we'll see a lot of the initial effort or improvement

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
common to domain specific language side and then the libraries will follow and catch up.
