00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.140
Trust in the trusted computing base is
going to come from a number of things

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.000
we expect it to do.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.770
We talked about design principles for
secure systems.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.370
And this system is something
that everything relies on it.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.130
So it better be secure
to the degree possible.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.210
So it should be using some
of those design principles.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.170
So let's go back and review
a number of those design principles

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.130
that we talked in general for
secure systems but

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.800
we're going to see that they also
apply to the trusted computing base.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.150
One of the design principles
was least privilege.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.270
Any time we are executing, the idea is
to execute with the fewest possible

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.300
privileges, and
the idea is that if something was wrong.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.310
So, remember trustworthy means
that a high likelihood that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.880
things go the way you want them to,
but there's no guarantee.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.700
There's no proof, as we said, so

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.710
if something were to go wrong of
course we have damage containment and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.050
fewer things will be affected
because what can be affected,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.750
what resources can be abused is based on
what privileges you hold at the time.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.050
So holding as few as you need for
doing what you're doing at the time.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.110
You want to use that principle even when
you design the trusted computing base.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.860
Economy is the other thing.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.960
Economy is, we also said,
keep it simple.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.210
It's really more important
when it comes to trusted code.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.850
You want to keep it simple and as small
as possible the other design principle,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.920
we're going to look at a couple
of these, is open design.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.650
The idea is that trust is not going to
come because somebody tells you take my

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.940
word for it.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.880
We're not going to have trust, or

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.610
confidence, when security
is by obscurity.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.451
We don't know how something is done, but

00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:42.668
we basically have to take
someone's word for it.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:45.678
That's not a good way to design
a trusted computing system.

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:49.876
You do want to have an open design so
security is because you understand

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:54.780
exactly how that level of security
is being accomplished or achieved.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.040
We definitely want complete mediation,
and that means that every access,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.290
that one of the basic requirements for
a trusted computing base,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.840
that every access is checked,
any attempt to bypass the system,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.980
to go to a resource that needs to be
secured, course is going to prevented.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.250
So we want complete mediation,
if that's not there then of course

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.310
you will have no trust in
the trusted computing base.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.265
We also talked about
other design principles.

00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:28.060
Fail-safe defaults is the default
that gives you safe behavior,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.700
so when it comes to access control,
the default should be denied.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.400
And finally ease of use or
psychological acceptability.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.270
Basically, we have to make the right
assumption about what users are able to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.210
do and what they're not able to do.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.880
If you make sort of assumptions
about users that are unreasonable.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.980
They're going to avoid security
that gets in their way.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.340
They're going to find ways
to work around it, and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.870
that's going to result in
a lower level of trust.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.390
I decided to sort of revisit
these design principles.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.860
One of the things we're talking about
here is the trusted computing base and

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.190
where trust comes from.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.470
Well, if it's designed with
the design principles in mind

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.510
the number of those that
we have discussed here.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.750
Of course,
that's a question you're going to ask.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.040
And if somebody answers in
the affirmative saying,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.810
yes, we follow those principles,
that's a good thing
