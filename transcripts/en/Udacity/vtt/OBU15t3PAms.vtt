00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer I'm looking for here is 10.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Certainly if we're just going to rearrange these elements,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the only way that these three elements can satisfy the heap property is if we put the 10 at the top

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we can actually leave the 17 where it is and the heap property will still be maintained at this node.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We'd swap the 10 and the 41 and now, this subtree may no longer have the heap property,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but we can make a new picture that looks a little something like this

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where we have two smaller trees and these have to satisfy the heap property

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
because the whole subtree that we had here used to satisfy it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
until we got that nice 10 out of the way and put in a nasty 41,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but notice now we're in the same situation we were in a moment ago, but on a smaller scale.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We have two subtrees that satisfy the heap property and a root that doesn't.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We can now repeat this process pushing these nasty values

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
down and down and deeper and deeper into the tree until they hit the bottom at a leaf

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
at which point, it doesn't matter how bit they are, the leaves can be very, very large.
