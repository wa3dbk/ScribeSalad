In the previous video, you saw that you could use this graph by checking the y

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.597
values and reading off the corresponding x values to find different points. But

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:12.255
wouldn't it be easier if the value that we've been using for y were actually

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:17.720
the input and the value we were reading off was the output instead? We actually

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.713
already know about this sort of thing. Which of these terms down here best

00:00:20.713 --> 00:00:25.060
describes what we're looking for? Is it the composition of B of t, the inverse

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.426
of B of t, the reflection of B of t in the y-axis, the reflection of B of t in

00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:36.610
the x-axis, or the y-intercept of B of t? Please consider this the x-axis and

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.969
this the y-axis for the purposes of this question.
