00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.060
Okay, well, the bands are part of the festival. So maybe we

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.090
just want to add a relationship to

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.840
festivals? Just like with attendees and stages?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.840
&gt;&gt; So, that might make sense. But, I

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.240
mean, bands will be playing at stages, and

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.910
stages look up to festivals. So it'd probably

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.306
make more logical sense to relate it to stages.

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:16.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.370
&gt;&gt; So we can add multiple levels of hierarchy here, and that's okay?

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.030
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.400
&gt;&gt; Okay.
