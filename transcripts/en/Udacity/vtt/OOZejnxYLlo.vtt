00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is again the simulation of heat conduction along a wire.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, thermal diffusivity and Δx² are spared out and only the result

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
after 10 seconds is being shown--no intermediate results.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The result after 10 seconds is going to be complex enough

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because we're going to modify the step size.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Find the step size that barely works. We don't want to see temperatures below the ambient temperature

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and in particular, we don't want to see negative temperatures.

00:00:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Leave three decimal places of that step size.
