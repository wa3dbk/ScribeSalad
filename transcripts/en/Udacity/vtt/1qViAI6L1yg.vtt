00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.670
The new caches object has potential.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.430
It's very easy to use,
it's asynchronous, and it's fast.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.710
But there are two big catches.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.280
First, like local storage,
it's transactional.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.170
So it's possible that there is
a risk of over writing data.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.230
The other issue is that the caches
object isn't available everywhere yet.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.526
So you're going to need
to feature detect and

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:31.400
potentially polyfill for some browsers.
