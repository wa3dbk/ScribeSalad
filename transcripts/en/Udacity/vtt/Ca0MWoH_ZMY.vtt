00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.719
Textcat was the name of the R package that Corey

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.490
used. We'll discuss R packages in the next video and what

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.000
they allow us to do. For the second question, the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.210
automated system captures between ten tweets to 20 tweets a day.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.680
For each of the tweets, the system will recommend that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.070
whoever sent the tweet file a report. Now, for this last

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.040
question, we accepted any text answer here. I thought that

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.870
the most interesting part was that Cory showed the open source

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.730
R code classifier on GitHub. GitHub is a repository for

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.689
sharing code. You can learn more about GitHub by following the

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.730
links in the instructor notes. It's the most popular repository

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.820
for open source projects and it's really easy to get started.
