00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.755
The origin is the point 0,0, which is right here, right in the center of our

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:07.682
axis. And, of course, we can write it as an ordered pair as well. Both the

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.158
x-coordinate and the y-coordinate are equal to 0. We saw earlier that this is

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.559
the point from which we started counting our other coordinates. So, this is sort

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:20.838
of like homebase. It's our reference point for figuring out distances to all

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.244
other points on our plane.
