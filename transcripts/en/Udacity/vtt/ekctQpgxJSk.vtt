00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A typical confidence is from 90% to 99%, you can find these values in tables.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They are called quantiles. There might be numbers like 2.58, 1.64, 1.96.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In this quiz, I just want you to tell me which of these numbers corresponds to what confidence intervals

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and I'll give you that to correct each of those match exactly one of those over here.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So check exactly three boxes.
