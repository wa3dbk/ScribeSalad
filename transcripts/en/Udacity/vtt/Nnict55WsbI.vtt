00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.210
In the previous lesson,
we built a method for

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.220
escaping the characters in
the parameters of our URL,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.590
to make sure that none of
the characters were unsafe ASCII.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.720
Now, our method worked, but Apple
actually provides a set of classes that

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.580
we can use to accomplish
the exact same thing.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.740
The first of these classes that we're
going to talk about is NSURLComponents.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.000
NSURLComponents is a class
designed to help us

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.650
build URLs in a piecewise fashion.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.720
That is to say that a URL can be built
from individual pieces or components.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.070
If we look at URLs more closely we
can start to see some of these common

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.160
components.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.980
Here's a URL for

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.770
a web page that has information about
Udacity's nano degree programs.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.480
We can actually omit the www portion.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.250
It isn't required, and
we can focus on the rest.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.810
The first part of the URL
called the scheme

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.160
specifies the protocol that we're using.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.470
In this case,
the scheme we're using is https.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.950
Next, the part many refer to as
the website name, here it's udacity.com,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.610
is called the host name,
or host for short.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.330
The host is used to determine
the location of the server.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.100
The final part of this
URL is called the path.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.850
It specifies the location on the server
where the resource that we want

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.870
is located.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.830
In this case, we want the resource
located at the path nanodegree.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.470
And like we said before, the resource
at this location is a webpage that has

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.940
information about Udacity's
nano degree programs.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.790
Using NSURL components, we can create
this URL in just a few lines of code.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
And you can see here in this code
example that I've had to use these slash

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.330
character in the path, that is required,
so it may not look the exact same on

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.040
the previous screen that we saw, but
you'll need to provide the slash here.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.290
But what about a more complex URL like
the ones we'll be using in FlickFinder?

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.765
Here's another example.

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:55.095
This URL uses the Flickr APIs
flickr.photos.search method.

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:55.795
And just so you know,

00:01:55.795 --> 00:02:00.005
I've omitted some of the parameters in
this particular example for brevity.

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.545
We can go ahead and label the scheme,
the host and the path,

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:05.455
but what do we call everything else?

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:09.830
Well the question mark separates the
path from the next component in this URL

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.850
that's called the query.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.260
The query is composed of name
value pairs that a server can

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.760
use to determine its response.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.660
You'll notice that each pair
is separated by an ampersand.

00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:27.247
To add the query component to
a URL using NSURLComponents,

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:32.080
we need to introduce a new
class called NSURLQueryItem.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.850
The NSURLQueryItem represents a single
name value pair in the query component

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.400
of a URL.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.560
To create an NSURLQueryItem
is pretty straightforward.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.230
We just need to specify the name and
the value.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.810
Then, NSURLComponents has
a property called queryItems,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.530
which is an array of NSURLQueryItem.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.592
So we can just add any queryItems
that we make to this array.

00:02:53.592 --> 00:02:58.220
In code,
it might look something like this.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.625
If we go over here we might
see the resulting URL.

00:03:02.587 --> 00:03:06.480
And I know this might seem like
a lot of work just to create a URL.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.010
But the big trade off is that NSURL
components takes care of insuring that

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.610
our URLs are properly escaped and
only contains safe ASCII characters.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.850
And that's a nice reinsurance for us.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.490
Let's take a look at one final example.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.070
This URL is taken from Matt Thompson's
post on NSURL components on NSHipster.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.720
I posted a link to the article
in the instructor notes.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.920
Now, on first glance this
URL is a lot to take in, but

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.730
it just contains some extra
optional components of the URL.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.820
They're already labeled here and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.780
if you're interested I encourage you
to check out the article to learn more.
