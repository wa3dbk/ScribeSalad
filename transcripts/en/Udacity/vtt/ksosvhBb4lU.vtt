00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
We've been working so much with inequalities that I'm not sure I even remember

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:07.894
how to solve an equation. You may recall this is an equal sign and when we

00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:12.052
isolate x on one side of an equation, we're finding actually a single value that

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:15.724
it's equal to on the other on the other side. Or at least that's what we're

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:19.191
doing as long as there's one number over there. Anyway, just to get our brains

00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:22.863
jogging about equations again and to make sure you haven't forgotten everything

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:26.284
you've learned in this class, let's solve this equation. Now before you go

00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:29.868
through all the steps of solving this, I'd like you to start by writing the two

00:00:29.868 --> 00:00:33.493
fractions on the left hand side of the equation as a single fraction. So find

00:00:33.493 --> 00:00:37.589
the common denominator, figure out how that changes the numerators and then

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:38.705
combine like terms.
