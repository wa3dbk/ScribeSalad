00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.770
We currently have a main view which
shows nothing, a menu view, and

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.490
an item view.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.840
Let's say that an item has stats,
like nutrition facts, but

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.940
we only want to show them if
the user wants to see them.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.050
Better yet, what if we want to send
a link to a friend that takes them right

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.200
to the strawberry
pudding's nutrition facts?

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.240
We can do all of this with
ember's nested routes.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.010
Ember's nested routes are really
powerful, and make building

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.540
seemingly complex applications,
well, actually pretty easy.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.367
When I think of a template, I think
of just a chunk of standalone HTML.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.920
Ember templates can also be
thought of as containers.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.610
The base container is
the application template,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.401
and contains all other templates.

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:43.510
Any site-wide HTML should go in here,
like a site's header,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.490
navigation, and footer.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.160
The menu template is contained inside
of the application template, and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.640
the item template also goes
inside the application template.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.040
We want to create a nutrition
template that's contained or

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.919
nested inside of our item template.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.010
Everything starts with a route, and
that will be item, and then the dynamic

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.210
segment, which will be the menu
item's name, and then nutrition.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.640
How does amber know how or
where to insert the item template

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.535
into the application template,
or nutrition into item?

00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:17.410
We'll look at that after we
generate the nutrition template.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.198
Let's create the nutrition route, and
have it nested inside the item route.

00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:25.560
Again, ember CLI updates the router, and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.130
creates a route file and
a template in a new item subfolder.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.400
Notice that nested routes
are created inside a function

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.150
that's been added as a last
argument to the containing route.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.920
Let's add some content to
the nutrition template, and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.450
let's add a link in the item
template to the nutrition view.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.600
Fantastic, the app's really
starting to come together.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.010
The application template contains item,
and item contains nutrition.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.670
Do you see these here?

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.960
This tells ember to insert
nested templates right here.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.270
You can do anything with this code,
though.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.430
Move it anywhere you want,
put it inside HTML, or even delete it.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.670
Careful when deleting them, though.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.660
If I delete this one,
then no other templates will show up,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.910
since they don't know
where to be nested.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.640
So I'll return each
one to the way it was.
