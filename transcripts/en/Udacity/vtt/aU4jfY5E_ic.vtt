00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One way of solving this is to find out which terms appear in several places--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for instance, this one--the number of persons taken from the susceptible to the exposed compartment

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and then the number of persons taken from the exposed to the infectious compartment,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the number of persons taken from the infectious to the recovered compartment.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If you write it like that, it's easier to read and you can immediately see

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that the total number is conserved.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The number of persons we lose here we gain here, the number of persons we lose here we gain here,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the number of persons we lose here is gain here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So up to very tiny round off errors of the total number and result you'll see that the infection

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
takes quite some time to evolve.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The maximum of the exposed compartment comes first and then comes

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the maximum of the infectious compartment, and as we go, you'll see that the number of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
susceptible persons shrinks drastically

00:00:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and the number of recovered persons grows by the same amount.
