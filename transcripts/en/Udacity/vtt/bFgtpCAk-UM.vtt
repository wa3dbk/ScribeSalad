&gt;&gt; Notice I didn't need to tell David what coffee house, what time of day,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.770
what he was ordering, who the cashier was etc. He has a script for that scene.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.189
And he associates it when needed. It helps with different expectations like,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.900
the cashier's going to give me my total, my drink should be coming up soon.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.470
If those expectations are not met, he knows something has gone wrong and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.930
he needs to react. This is the power of script.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.910
It helps to generate expectations about scenes in the world.
