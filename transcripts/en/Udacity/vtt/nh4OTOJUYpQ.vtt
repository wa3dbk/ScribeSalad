00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Recall from our last few units that lexical analysis

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is the process of breaking up a string into a list of tokens.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We are now getting into syntactical analysis,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which takes a list of words and tells you if that list of words

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is a valid derivation in the grammar, follows the rules

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of the formal grammar, is in the language of the grammar.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
All 3 of those mean the same thing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Just as the process of doing lexical analysis is sometimes called lexing,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the process of doing syntactical analysis is called parsing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Parsing or syntactical analysis involves breaking down a list of tokens

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to see if it's valid in the grammar, or breaking down a list of words

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to see if they follow the rules of a language.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
To make our web browser our interpreter for HTML and JavaScript,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we're going to combine the lexing we've already learned about

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
with the parsing that we'll be learning in this unit and the next,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and that's going to give us a huge amount of power.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Or to put this another way, lexing word rules plus sentence rules from parsing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is going to give us a scope and a structure in which to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
express creative utterances.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's time to put those 2 great tastes together.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Here on the left I have a simple expression grammar

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that mentions numbers as a terminal,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and over here on the right I have a rule

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in our lexer for figuring out when a string is a number,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
if it matches this particular regular expression.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If I put the 2 of these together plus a similar rule for

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
what it means to write a plus sign and what it means to write a minus sign,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
then I can suddenly tell that more realistic strings

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
like 1 + 2 are valid in our language.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
1 matches our rule for number.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The plus matches our rule for plus.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
2 matches our rule for number, and then this whole utterance,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
number plus number, is in the language of our grammar for expressions, so this is good.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Similarly, 33 is a number. 44 is a number.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Minus is the minus sign. This is great.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And over here I've got 7 + 2 - 2,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
or if you like, 7 + or - 2, which I hear is a magic number.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Down here at the bottom I have a slightly longer derivation

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that shows off both the grammar part

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and also the lexical analysis part.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Grammar turns expression into expression plus expression.

00:02:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Lexical analysis turns number into 5 or 6 or some such.
