00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.860
So the next question becomes, given a set of animals, or in general,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.260
a set of objects or elements, and a set of percepts for each of those animals,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.170
how can we decide what's a good equivalence class for those animals? Consider,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.120
for example, the three animals shown here, eagle, bluebird, and penguin.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.870
Let us suppose that we knew that there are six percepts that are important for

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.150
each one of these animals. Lays eggs, has wings, has talons, and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.200
so on. But in order to decide what might be a good equivalence class for

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200
these three animals, we first have to decide on what might be

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.050
the right values for each of these percepts for

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.030
each animal. So I'm going to ask you to use your background knowledge,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.790
to fill in the values of the percepts that applies to each of the animals.
