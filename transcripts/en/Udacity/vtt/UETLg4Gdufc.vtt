So, it's important to test your code, because you never know the impact it's

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.420
going to have. You sit down and you write a piece of software for one thing,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.520
and someone else might see it a month or year down the road. And think of

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.620
another awesome way it can be used, and you want to make sure that a code you

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.290
write doesn't break in other situations. And I think that's one of the things

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.340
that's awesome about computing, is that the code we write has such a big

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.700
impact. But in order for it to have a big impact, we need to be very vigilant

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.710
about making sure that it's good. And we build a good product that other people

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.715
can then take and do more awesome things with.
