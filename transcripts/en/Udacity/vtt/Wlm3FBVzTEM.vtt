00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.149
We've spent our time talking about research methods. But one crucial aspect we

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:09.397
did not discuss in detail is ethics and psychology. It's important to know that

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:13.894
before any study is conducted, whether it's with humans or animals. It must be

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:18.430
approved by a federally mandated committee. For humans, it's the Institutional

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.260
Review Board. And for animals, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.570
All committee members must be trained and certified to serve. Let's talk about

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.248
the IRB. For humans, two important questions are asked regarding any research

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:40.834
proposal. First is, should the study be done at all? Here, committee members

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:44.802
are going to look at the risks versus the benefits of participating in that

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:50.442
research. If committee members feel that the benefits outweigh the risks, the

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:57.180
second question is asked. This is, what constitutes adequate informed consent?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.074
Here the experimenters have to tell the participants, exactly every step that

00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:07.876
they will need to complete throughout the experiment. Another important aspect

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:12.037
of ethics in psychology is the right for the participant to leave the

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:17.964
experiment at any time without negative consequences. Finally, once a

00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:21.618
participant has completed the experiment, it's important to debrief that

00:01:21.618 --> 00:01:25.985
person. Meaning we have to let the person know what the purpose of the study

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:30.188
was, and they have the right to ask any questions regarding the study. Some

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:33.779
main points to remember about research ethics, are that we don't want to put

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:39.602
anybody in harms way. We don't want to deceive anybody, unnecessarily and we

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:45.584
must ensure participant's privacy. Research ethics are fundamental in the study

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:50.247
of psychology. In fact, ethics are the most important part of psychological

00:01:50.247 --> 00:01:51.520
research.
