The answer is, there will be a runtime error, because some drawables can't be

00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:08.250
cast to type movable. If I compile and run the scene the way I did before, I'll

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.223
get this drawing and this exception. ClassCastException, house cannot be cast

00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:18.779
to Movable. The program never got to the moving part. It looks like BlueJ has

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.396
kindly taken me to the line where the ClassCastException happened. It looks

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:26.180
like we tried to treat something like a moveable that was not actually

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.400
moveable. And as you can see the program crashed completely.
