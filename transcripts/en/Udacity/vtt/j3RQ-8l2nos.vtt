00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.368
Here let's calculate the average number of shoes owned by females: =average

00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:13.798
(A2:A8). We get 33.14. Here let's calculate the average pairs of shoes owned by

00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:21.198
males. Looks like on guy owns a lot of shoes. We get 18. Here we'll calculate

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:28.200
squared deviations for females. And in column D, square deviations for males.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:37.661
In cell c2, we'll put equals a2 minus dollar sign a dollar sign 10. So we're

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:43.910
subtracting the mean. And then square it. This time let's just drag it down.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.952
Now we have all our square deviations. We'll take the sum of squares and divide

00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:54.420
by n minus 1, which is 6. There we have our variance. And if we take the square

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.600
root of the variance We get the sample standard deviation. Now I'll do the same

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.896
for males, and then we get that the standard deviation is 34.27. If you're very

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:09.991
comfortable calculating this step by step, you know exactly what to do and you

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:15.409
don't have to remember anything or review how to do it. Then feel free to

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.035
calculate the standard deviation using the function stdev. If we write equals

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:29.508
stdev, and then put the cells a2 to a8, then we get the same thing. And same

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:35.190
here. Equals stdev, We want the standard deviation of the pairs of shoes owned

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:44.048
by men. B2 colon B12. That's a good way to check your answers. But if you don't

00:01:44.048 --> 00:01:47.184
know how to do this step by step, then I really recommend to continue

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:52.299
practicing to the point that it becomes second nature. because that'll help you

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.329
remember the process and understand what's going on in the calculation of the

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.099
standard deviation. Now, we have almost all the information we need to do the t

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:03.484
test.
