00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.724
Now let's compare cross-site request
forgery and cross-site scripting.

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:07.640
In cross-site scripting,
the user's browser

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.280
trusts a badly implemented website
that does not check input content.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.730
That is, the attacker is able to inject
a script into the trusted website and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.860
as a result, the user's browser
executes the attacker's script.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.000
In cross-site request forgery a website
trusts that requests are from the user.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.760
But in fact, the attacker forges
user requests to the website.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.220
As a result, the website executes
the attackers malicious actions.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.720
Both cross-site scripting and cross-site
request forgery are the results of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.510
security weakness of websites.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.410
In particular,
the lack of authenticating and

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.540
validating user input.
