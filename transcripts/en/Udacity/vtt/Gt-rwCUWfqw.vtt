00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's take up this target business model and customer development

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but you know before we even begin one of the first questions I tend to ask is what is a company?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What is it that I'm trying to actually start?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Just for the sake this class, I think we ought to just use this definition.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
A company is a business organization

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with sales, a product, or service in exchange for revenue and profit.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So explicitly for the purpose of this class, I'm eliminating nonprofits.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let me be clear, you could use the business model canvas and customer development

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to go through the process for nonprofit but actually having some goals that are fairly concrete revenue

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and profit allows us to measure whether we're succeeding and failing in very clear ways

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and then we adjust to the question. What's a startup?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It tells use where the company is but how does a startup different,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and for me you have know I spent 20 years doing eight startups

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and I never could have given you a definition on the top my head what a startup is.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I always thought a startup is where we have free food.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Where there is a great small team or you could bring your dog and whatever,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but I never quite understood the purpose of a startup.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So I'm going to give you Steve's definition of what it is your actually doing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A startup is a temporary organization design to

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now let's go back and parts the sentence because this is pretty important.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Number one is temporary. The goal of a startup is not to be startup.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
A startup actually aims to bring you company.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Well that's kind of interesting because if you really think about it at least if you're a web mobile startup

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
there is no such thing as a ten year old startup.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
There's a two year old startup attached to an eight year old failure.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
A start up is a temporary organization and what are you suppose to be doing?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Well, while you think it might be built on the product or maybe if your thinking harder

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it might be get customers, actually no.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
A startup is actually design to search person. Well that' kind of interesting.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
What is it that I'm suppose to be searching for? Let see.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well number one, you want to search for something that's repeatable

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and repeatable means the same thing that works on Monday, works on Wednesday,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and works on Friday, and works next week, and works the next month.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That is I want to find sales and ,marketing, and engineering processes that are repeatable.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I also want to find them scalable.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What scalable means, I put a dollar in, I get two dollars out,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
or I put a dollar in and maybe I get ten dollars out.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But I better not be loosing money on a continual basis or I'm called an out of business startup.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Okay, I know I'm searching for something repeatable and scalable but

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
what is it that I'm searching for?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What you're searching for is the business model

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and that business model search is the basis of the rest of the class.

00:03:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's take a look and see how we become okay.
