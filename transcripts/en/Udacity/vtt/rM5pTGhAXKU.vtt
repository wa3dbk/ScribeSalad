00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.918
Like we were just talking about, when you look at the expression, X squared

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:08.076
minus 1, it's sometimes hard to remember that it's factorable because it looks

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:12.317
so simple. It's kind of not that intuitive, that expression that has 2 terms.

00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:16.441
Can be factored to equal the product of 2 expressions that each have 2 terms. I

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.601
know that I was pretty blown away when I first learned about the differences of

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:24.987
2 squares. And how it's factorable. What if instead of the difference of two

00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:29.629
squares though, we had the difference of two cubes. Something like Y cubed minus

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:34.124
Z cubed. Since the difference of two squares is factorable, maybe this is too.

00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:38.684
I've given you 3 choices here, 2 of which are possible factorizations of Y cubed

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:42.824
minus Z cubed, and the third choice, which is that this expression is not

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:46.243
factorable. Please pick what you think is the best choice.
