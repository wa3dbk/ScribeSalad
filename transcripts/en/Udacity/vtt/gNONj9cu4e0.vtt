So, we've modified crawler.py to do the top part. Now, what we want to do in the

00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:10.482
server is load that file, produce a Web Corpus and use that. So, for this last

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:15.474
quiz, your goal is to modify the server.py file to load the Web Corpus from the

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:20.500
corpus,pkl file we created. If it fails for some reason though, we don't want

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.511
the server to just crash. What we want to do is create a new Web Corpus by doing

00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:26.363
a web crawl.
