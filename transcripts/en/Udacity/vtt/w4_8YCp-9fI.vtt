00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.791
&gt;&gt; And, in fact, we can simplify this even further by replacing this with a

00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:10.381
special symbol and replacing these with something shorter. The symbol we'll use

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:15.102
for sum, is this, sigma. And instead of writing out the whole salary of

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:20.612
Geography majors, we'll just calls this x. And instead of writing out number of

00:00:20.612 --> 00:00:26.227
Geography majors, we'll just call this n, for number. So now, we have a really

00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:31.953
nice formula for the mean, x bar equals the sum of x divided by n. Isn't that

00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:37.693
pretty? Now remember, this is for a sample, and you saw in Lesson 1 that the

00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:43.928
sample statistic is denoted by x bar. For a population, we denote it by mu. And

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:49.356
again, we can say it's the sum of x divided by big N, because this is the number

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:55.403
in the entire population, whereas, this is the number in the sample. Now, this

00:00:55.403 --> 00:01:01.407
might look Greek to you, well, it is. Sigma is the Greek letter capital S, which

00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:06.823
makes sense because it means sum. When you see sigma and then x, this is then

00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:12.041
telling you to add everything that comes after the sigma. And actually,

00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:19.200
sometimes, there'll be a little i here. And this is going from i equals 1 to n,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.020
meaning that we sum x1 plus x2 all the way to xn and then divide by the total

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:39.980
number. So, in this case this is x1, this is x2, x3, x4, and x5. And n is 5. So,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.648
this is telling us that we sum everything from x1 all the way to xn. Now, don't

00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:49.360
be intimidated by these symbols. In fact, I'm hoping that you're going to get

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.324
more and more comfortable with using symbols throughout the course. So that, by

00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:58.769
the end, none of this seems intimidating. The reason I want you to feel

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:03.254
comfortable using symbols is because they're very important and they'll help you

00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:07.892
with your mathematical thinking in every class. Symbols are like the alphabet.

00:02:07.892 --> 00:02:12.184
The alphabet is basically symbols and we use these symbols to tell a story.

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:16.350
We've used them to learn about people from hundreds of years ago, who have

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.981
written their thoughts, in these symbols. Now, it's the same with Math. Except,

00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:25.458
since Math is a different kind of language, we have different symbols. And Math

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:29.709
is a universal language. These symbols are used across the world, which is

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.954
really awesome. Mathematics is a way of thinking, and it has evolved over

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:38.596
thousands of years. And the way we symbolize these thoughts has evolved with it.

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:43.010
This statistical notation is shorthand instructions that tell us what to do.
