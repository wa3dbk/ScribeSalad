00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.476
Let's pretend again, for a minute, that's Grant's interest is compounded just

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:08.468
one time a year. If you invest that same $10,000 at that same 3% annual rate,

00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:15.030
then after four years, he'll have this amount of money, as we saw before. Let's

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.545
talk about what this means, this expression here. $10,000 represents the

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:25.540
principle. This initial amount of money he invested and it goes right here.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.136
Point o three here is the interest rate written as a decimal. Three percent

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:37.336
becomes point o three. Then last but not least we have our exponet four. This

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:41.270
represents the number of years that the money has been invested in the account.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.420
Now this worked fine for compounding just one time a year, but it's not going

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.194
to work as well for compounding twice a year. If we switch the compounding to

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:53.034
twice a year instead of once a year, then this is the expression we came up

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:59.160
with. So what can we say about comparing these two expressions we've just seen?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.500
I'd like you to tell me that by filling in this sentence. When we switch from

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.050
compounding interest once a year to twice a year, what happens to the interest

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.354
rate and what happens to the exponent here?
