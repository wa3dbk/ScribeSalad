00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.980
In addition to the three main features, there's some other relatively lesser,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.640
less used features of OCL that I just wanted to mention.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.450
There's the concept of tuples. This is similar to what you would do in

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.179
a programming language where you would have structs or records.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:24.070
There are frenzy enumerations that you see in, in Java and other languages.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.275
There's the ability to express messages. We haven't gone into this as much but

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:34.330
in UML diagrams, you can express messages. There's access to the UML meta model.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.070
And there's the concept little word concept of automatic flattening.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.160
Say, we did our navigation, and along the way we came upon two situations,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.750
two associations which were have many participants in them.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.040
So we might end up with a set of sets, or a set of bags, or

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.960
something like that. OCL has made the decision to do automatic flattening,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.048
that says if you have a set of sets, you just get one set.

00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:08.640
You don't in your syntax have to express two levels of access in order to get at

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.650
the contents. This can make it a little bit easier to write your expressions.
