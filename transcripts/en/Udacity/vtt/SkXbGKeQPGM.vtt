00:00:00.158 --> 00:00:03.680
Okay, so adding Memcache to Ascii Chan gave us two

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.140
new properties that are really nice. One is that our cache

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.990
survives restarts. Before when we're using that dictionary cache, if we

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.970
updated our code, either locally or in production, our cache gets

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.240
cleared. That's not a good quality. Or if, you know, in

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.230
production if Google for some reason. Moves us a different machine

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.120
or something like that. What's going to happen, our cache would get

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.447
cleared. Which is also you know, it's not a good property,

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:27.377
especially if you have a lot of traffic. And

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:31.472
our app is now stateless, which is the key

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:35.187
to scaling. What stateless means is our app between

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:38.648
any two requests, stores no state. And that means we

00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:40.871
ca, that, that a, a number of, a number

00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:43.690
of properties come from this. You know, there's no state

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.020
between requests. Which means our apps are now interchangeable.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.440
Which means we can have multiple apps without any drama.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.100
You know, we have our load balancer, we have our Memcached.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.600
And in between those two pieces of technology are as many

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.080
app servers as we need. You know, adding more app servers

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.110
is easy. likewise, removing an app server is also easy and,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.519
and not painful. And it means our apps can be scaled

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.930
independently of. Our cache and our database. So we've got our

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.610
app servers. You know, we've got our, our database, and you

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.560
know we've got our cache. And if we find ourselves needing more

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.730
app servers, we can add one. Let's add our load balancer in here

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.430
for good measure. So now I've got all these pieces. We need another

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.580
app server we add one. If we need another Memcache, we add one.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.990
Having lots of caches means we won't have to scale our database quite

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.510
so fast, but if we need more database, we talked about this in

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.770
unit three. You know, we can go with replication or we can go

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.120
with sharding. But now you're starting to see the the kind of the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.800
bigger picture of how a website might grow. If you're really data heavy.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.962
You have lots of databases and maybe lots of caches. You know, if

00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:46.482
your database is, is very read heavy but not [UNKNOWN] it's not actually

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:49.070
not a lot of data you would have more caches. If your, if

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.514
your application is very computationally intensive, maybe

00:01:51.514 --> 00:01:52.736
you have lots of app servers and

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:55.626
you don't need so much database support or not so much cache support.

00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:58.458
But what we want to do, is we want to make sure that all of

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:01.170
these different pieces can grow independently.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.210
And that's kind of what scaling is

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.910
all about, is putting yourself in a position so that when your app is

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.740
constrained in different ways, you can grow each part kind of independent of the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.230
others. And now that our app is stateless, it's really easy to do that. And

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.790
Memcache helps a lot because all of the, all of the state is either stored in

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.410
cookies, the DB or Memcache, but not the apps. And that's really handy.
