00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.480
So remember the darker the color, the stronger

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.540
the imbalance. So the dark blue Russian region and

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.800
the dark red Saudi Arabian regions would have the

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.600
strongest imbalances. Other areas like China do have a

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.090
slight imbalance, too. You can see because it's pinkish

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.210
not, not as dark red as Saudi Arabia, but

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.950
they do have more males than females. And other

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.340
regions like Australia, Brazil, and Canada also have a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.440
slight imbalance, because you can see they're light blue, meaning that they have

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.010
more females than males. But they're not as blue as the Russian region is.
