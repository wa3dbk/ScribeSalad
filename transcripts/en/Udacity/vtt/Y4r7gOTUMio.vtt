00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.310
One thing I like to mention really quick is how I work,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.860
in terms of what things I have open.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.680
This is something that I always try to get guys who work with me,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.400
at, I'd rather not have a month to do.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.050
Got your browser, you're running your things in it.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.360
And you've got your editor with your code in it.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.580
Your browsers got some pictures and some text.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.730
If your screen is big enough, I like to have them side by side, but

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.050
sometimes that's not the case.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.190
Something people often neglect is having your terminal nearby.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.340
I almost always, like when I'm doing app engine or

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.940
my own stuff, run the app server auto terminal so you can see the logs.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.670
If you're developing, without being able to see your logs, there's so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.870
much stuff you're going to miss.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.570
I find many, many bugs just by using my website as in developing, and

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.060
watching how the, how the logs goes.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.130
Because many times there's an error that you're not even aware of that could be

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.250
a big deal in production.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.650
You could have fixed it in five seconds if

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.360
you had just noticed the logs scrolling weird.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.570
An, another important thing, and this is one of my frustrations in App Engine

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.600
right now, is it's critical if you're writing code that writes to a database,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.320
but the queries that you're running are printed to the log.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.500
I've kind of tried different strategies of hacking my app engine to print

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.580
every time it runs a query, because if you've got some complicated setup with

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.890
your database and your cache, and your mem cache, and maybe a local cache, and

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.610
all sorts of things, you want to make sure it's working.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.920
And I know when I'm developing I often introduce bugs that has somehow prevent

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.670
something from being cached properly.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.650
And if I am browsing along and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.960
I see all these database queries scrolling by that shouldn't be,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.190
that's a sign that something is broken.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.960
And I want to make sure generally that every page I run doesn't hit

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.020
the database unless absolutely required.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.730
If I see a query running that shouldn't be,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.570
you know, I can catch it by just having the log open.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.310
Try to get in the habit of when your switch from your editor to your browser

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.450
that you instead switch from your editor to your browser plus a terminal, so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.670
you can see things working.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.330
You start to get a sense for how the logs scrolls when your

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.810
website's working normally, so when it deviates, you can detect it faster.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.930
You'll save yourself a lot of heartache doing it that way.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.000
Now, I'd like to move on to how we actually built some of these

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.450
websites that I've been referring to.
