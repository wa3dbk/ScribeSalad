00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.220
In terms of communicating your findings and when

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.430
you are a data scientist, you try, you tend

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.166
to think in terms of code and in

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:12.320
terms of ideas that are very mathematical etc. Or

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.790
statistical you do want to have the rigor,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.110
the mathematical and statistical rigor, but you also want

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.570
to make it such that somebody who is not

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.690
familiar with that, may understand, what you're talking about.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.460
So, so make it into a story. Make it into something that is easily

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.080
understandable and communicable in English, for example.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.100
Or, whichever language you prefer in your group.
