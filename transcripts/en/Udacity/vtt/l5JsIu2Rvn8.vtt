00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.369
So for the next quiz, I'm going to make this a little more interesting

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:06.600
and assume I'm not quite so picky about who my friends are.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm going to be friends with people whose name starts with either "D"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
or the letter "N".

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So now the question is: we're still going to define the procedure, is_friend

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but I've changed my definition of a friend,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so now we assume that I'm friends with everyone whose name starts with

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
either the letter "D' or the letter "N", but no one else.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So this result would still be correct--that would be correct.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If we asked: is_friend a name that starts with the letter "N,"

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.377
let's say "Ned,"

00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:38.000
then we should also get the result, True

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So see if you can figure out how to define "is_friend" for this new definition.
