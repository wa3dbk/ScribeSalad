As Susan said I want to talk about cannabis, or marijuana. Cannabis has been

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.008
used for a very long time, and there's a lot of information on the internet

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:11.338
that you have access to. If you're interested in looking up it's pretty awesome

00:00:11.338 --> 00:00:14.929
history. But for this class we're just going to focus on the reported effects

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.337
and potential medical uses of cannabis. First thing to know is that cannabis is

00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:22.977
a plant, and when taken into the body, it produces a variety of physiological,

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:26.450
psychological, and behavioral effects.
