00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.170
HI, everyone, I'm here with Yunha,
who's a founder of Locket.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.360
And I'll also be speaking to her
co-founder Kashik later in the course.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.560
Yunha, can you tell me
a little bit about Locket and

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.940
sort of how you got started?

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.640
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.930
So it's a company that's two years old.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.880
I used to work in investment bank, and
that was my first job out of college.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.170
And the idea was this lock screen that
we're staring at 150 times per day,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.470
it's nothing better than just
a photo and a clock, currently.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.310
Can we do something better
than that was the idea?

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.290
So then I quite my job promptly, and
then I started building the team.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.692
So that's where I found
my co-founder Kashik.

00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:40.890
And then we moved into
a two-bedroom apartment.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.290
Where I lived with five other guys and
three dogs, and living out

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.410
of the bedrooms and working out of the
living room, so that's how we started.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.875
And the V1 model was to, hey can
we show ads on the lock screen and

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:59.310
get paid from advertisers and pay users
to just rent out the lock screen?

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.860
So that was our initial start.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.890
It started off as a very Ramen Noodle
startup, kind of like a project.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.820
And then it just suddenly
became a company,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.150
after we started fundraising and such.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.970
&gt;&gt; Great, and
how was the early user adoption?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.960
How did you guys start finding users and
getting that traction?

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.450
&gt;&gt; It was very abrupt.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.620
We thought that we would get like
10,000 users in the first month and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.500
that's how we calculated all these
other ad sales and all that stuff.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.080
We ended up getting 25,000
users on the first day.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.840
And then we ended up getting like
a million users from that V1 model.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.440
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.680
&gt;&gt; Which ended up failing.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.350
Which is why we pivoted
into a different model.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.610
Which is showing compound
on the lock screen.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.020
The app is launched,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.200
it's called LockIt, and
it's launched in the Google Play store.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.210
It will show relevant
news on your lock screen.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.420
Every time you wake up your phone
it'll show different news, so

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.410
that you're keeping the know.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.554
&gt;&gt; Great.
And so you originally had the product

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:04.817
which was ads-based, and then you moved
into news because you thought that was

00:02:04.817 --> 00:02:08.651
bigger traction it was something that
was in demand and people wanted.

00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:13.364
&gt;&gt; So, the way in which our thought
process worked was we couldn't pay, so

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:16.990
when we were doing
the paper ad swap model.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.990
What happen was because we got so
many users in a short period of time.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.890
It was impossible for us to plan out
the next ad cycle, because without

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.400
knowing how many millions of
users we'll have the next month,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.430
it was impossible to
sell the ads in advance.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.830
Also, not only that because
advertisers pay us three months

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.750
after the ad campaigns
have been finished.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.001
So we were in business of paying
users first before getting paid from

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:43.720
advertisers.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.230
&gt;&gt; So we needed to raise a lot,
like millions of dollars.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.950
And we're just like a three
months old company.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.030
&gt;&gt; So we had to make a decision.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.140
We're not going to do this anymore.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.760
Then what is the other type of value
that we can provide on the lock screen.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.043
And the idea was, okay,
we just tried out the economics model

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:04.080
which is like paying and
rewarding users.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.670
Can we deliver the right content at
the right time to our users that way?

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.640
When we're pivoting we showed,
we were just testing out by

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.210
showing some of these other articles
like Justin Bieber just went to jail or,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.310
did you know that this airplane had x,
y and z?

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.940
And the engagement on those
articles were really great, so

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.250
then we went to talk to these meetup
companies who wanted to partner us and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.335
to distribute the content.

00:03:32.335 --> 00:03:36.776
So that's kind of like the transition
in which we kind of made.

00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:41.010
And also user base changed a little bit
too, because when we were paying users,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.949
it was the users that really
valued that $3 to $5 per month.

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.810
Whereas as we were moving
toward the content model,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.630
it's the users that
are hungry to learn more.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And just get this content.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.230
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
