00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.828
Here's the orthographic projection in all its glory. It really doesn't look

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:07.234
like much. It turns out that the orthographic projection matrix is pretty

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:12.820
simple and uses nothing you don't already know. So, that's the question to you.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.656
Does this matrix perform scaling? Does it perform rotation? Translation and

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:22.564
projection? Check all that apply. My hint to you is to see the matrix zones

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:27.154
lesson. By the way I want non-trivial answers here. For example, a pure

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:30.910
rotation matrix has a translation of 0, 0, 0, that doesn't count.
