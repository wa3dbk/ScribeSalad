00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.910
As an example consider this
portfolio where we have Google,

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.460
Apple, Gold, and Exxon from the
beginning of 2010 to the end of 2010.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.370
This is what the performance of
that portfolio would look like

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.910
in the blue line, if we had
an equal allocation to each asset.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.590
So, we gave 25% to each of those
stocks at the beginning, and

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.650
then we observed at the end,
the total performance.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.690
And we include a chart here for
S&amp;P 500 for comparison.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.980
Now, this is an un-optimized portfolio.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.830
Here's what it would look like
if we optimized for sharp ratio.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.120
Look at that.
Look how much

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.326
higher performance we get compared
to our benchmark S&amp;P 500.

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:49.789
And observe over here
the allocations to the assets.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:57.010
60% goes to Gold, 40% to Apple and
none to Google or Exxon.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.940
Now, one thing to emphasize here is,
this is looking back in time,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.900
so we're looking back historically.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.730
What happened in 2010 and
observing at the beginning of 2010,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.050
if we knew what we knew now,
how should we best allocate?

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.650
So, there's a question as to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.800
how much this can help our
portfolio going forward.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.880
And I'll give you that
answer ahead of time.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.790
Indeed, when we optimize for
sharp ratio, hold that portfolio,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.630
rebalance, in other words re-optimize
that sharp ratio and continue that month

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.030
by month, we very often,
most frequently see that that improves

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.220
the performance of the portfolio
versus just an equal allocation.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.710
But I do want to observe that
this is computing back in time,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.050
so, yes, of course we can
find a better portfolio,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.890
but indeed it helps
going forward as well.
