Actually, we can create any normal distribution with any normal distribution.

00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:11.222
Sorry if that sounds confusing. Basically, we can take any normal distribution,

00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:16.367
convert it to the standard normal distribution and then scale it any way we

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:22.262
want. So, for example, let's say we want to give everyone a popularity score

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:27.755
from 0 to a 100, with 50 being the mean. And let's say we want the standard

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:33.837
deviation to be 10. We start with our original Facebook distribution, where the

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:39.657
mean is 190 and the standard deviation is 36. So let's say that someone has 210

00:00:39.657 --> 00:00:45.721
Facebook friends. Let's first convert this to a Z score. What's that going to be

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:49.090
and where does it fall in this distribution?
