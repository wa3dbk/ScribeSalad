00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.910
So the way that you run a transaction

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.710
in Objectify, is equal ofy().transact, at the start of

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.470
the transaction and you specify new work and

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.880
if you don't want the transaction to return anything,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.020
then you would use new void work instead

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.790
of work. And then you call the run method,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.600
and then inside the run method you do the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.760
stuff you want done inside the transaction, and if

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.960
your transaction expects a return result. Don't forget

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.530
to return it. There are some things that are

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.500
different in transactions in Objectify and in the raw

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.660
Java store API. For example, Objectify does not use

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.740
snapshot isolation. This can affect the outcome of

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.140
queries and gets inside a transactions. My advice is

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.730
to try to limit your use of transactions. So

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.940
that you only do updates inside a transaction because

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790
it can be confusing to know exactly, what the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.660
outcome of queries will be. Anyway, I encourage you

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.280
to read about transactions in the Objectify developer guide.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.960
So go ahead and implement the to do's in register

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.870
for conference. And when you've implemented the function, run

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.040
the app on local host and try registering for

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.490
conference. You could use the API's explorer to test

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.060
out the new functionality to register for conference. I find

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.880
it's easiest to query conferences and then to copy

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.530
one of the website's key strings of the conference

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620
that I'm going to want to attend. Now I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.790
can go and register for the conference. You have to

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.460
have the web safe key string. So, I'm going to

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.840
enter it here and I'm going to execute function and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.640
we'll see what got back. Result, true. So, hopefully

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.609
that means I am in fact registered for that conference.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.770
Let's take a look in the datastore admin. I'm on

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.020
local hosts, I'm going to go to the admin console

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.570
on local hosts, and list the profiles and there I

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.550
am, and I'm registered for conference. You can see that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.680
I can't tell from here what the name of the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.380
conference is. But programmatically, you can take the conference key

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.500
and from that, you can define the conference name, if

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.870
you wanted to. You should also find that the UI

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.740
works, for registering for a conference. And you see that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.040
it says that you can unregister from a conference. Well actually,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.920
it won't work to unregister from a conference because you haven't

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.640
yet, implemented the functionality to do that. So now its your

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.750
turn to go ahead and write the code for implement

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.450
register for a conference. For the profile class need to have

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.530
the conference keys to attend property and your also going to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.110
need to write the methods to get add and remove values.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.240
Then you're going to need to copy the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.650
skeleton code for register for conference into conference API.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.070
And then fill in the ToDo's in registerForConference in

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.520
the Conference API class. Don't forget when you copy

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.120
over the registerForConference skeleton, you're going to need to

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.700
make sure you also copy over the wrapped boolean

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.800
class. When you implement registerForConference, you'll notice that the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.220
method is defined to throw some exceptions, and you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.790
need to honor that. If you change the way the method

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.150
behaves, for example, you change the exceptions that it throws, or

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.330
it throws different exceptions, or it doesn't throw them in the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.370
right place, the UI for registering for conferences won't work properly.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.280
And then to check what happens when you try to register

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.080
for a conference that has no seats available. Just create a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.980
conference with zero seats left. The easiest way to create a

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.310
conference with zero seats left is that when you create the conference

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.240
just set max attendees to zero. If you want to see

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.740
what happens if you try to register for a conference that you've

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.290
already registered for you'll need to use the API's Explorer. Because

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.300
the conference page in the UI will know if you've already registered

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.190
and won't offer you the option to register again. So how

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.270
did you check that your code worked? Did you check that the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.620
conference keys to attend property of the profile entity, contains a string

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.380
of the conference key? Or did you look to see if the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.120
conference keys to attend property of the profile, contains the conference

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.630
name? Did you check, if the seats available of the conference? Is

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.830
one less than the max of the attendees of the conference.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.950
And did you try registering for a conference that you had created?
