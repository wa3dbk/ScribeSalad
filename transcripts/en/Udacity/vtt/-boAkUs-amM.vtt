00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.971
We know the z score, so we can find the probability of getting anything less

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:12.658
than that z score using our z table. So here's 0.8 and here's the column where

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:20.190
it intersects 0.04. So the probability of getting less than a mean of 40 is

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:27.609
0.7995. So the probability of getting greater than a mean of 40 is 1 minus

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.148
0.7995, which is only about 0.2. So it's somewhat unlikely to have randomly

00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:39.710
drawn a sample from the whole Klout population with a mean of 40. If this mean

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.694
wasn't selected by chance, then it's possible that this app, the Bieber Tweeter,

00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:51.150
which automatically re-tweets Justin Bieber, could have played a role in

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.000
increasing these people's Klout scores. But how unlikely is a probability of

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.502
0.2? There's no set threshold. But in the next lesson, we're going to show you

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:08.386
how statisticians have formally decided whether or not something is likely or

00:01:08.386 --> 00:01:09.084
unlikely.
