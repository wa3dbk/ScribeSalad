Now that we've dealt with our money from
wipers, let's move on to figure out how

00:00:03.955 --> 00:00:07.812
much money Grant's going to make, from
selling this first batch of nozzles.

00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:13.488
Remember that, 11 people, each asked him
for two nozzles. Also, we decided that n

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:18.139
is equal to the price per nozzle. This is
for one nozzle, not for two nozzles. So,

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:23.044
which of these choices do you think is
equal to the money he is going to earn

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:25.460
from these nozzle sale so far?
