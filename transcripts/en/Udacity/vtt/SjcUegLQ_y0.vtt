00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
The correct answer here is O(n²),

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.620
and to see that, we just have to look at how many time steps of this

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.620
I wouldn't requires other function within.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.450
As you remember, this line up here takes zero times steps

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.340
because it's just a memory access and we said those were free.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.920
This one here, it depends again what you do with the end of the range here

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.230
but it's going to be executed about n times, so it's either n or n + 1.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.610
That doesn't really make much difference here because now we can use big O notation.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.170
How often is this inner loop here executed?

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.900
The first time, it's actually executed n times,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.530
then the next time it's executed, it's going to be executed on the n - 1 times,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.650
and so on and so on because this i here, this value here increases,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.190
and as this increases, this inner loop here is going to be executed less and less times.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.950
Here we have first time, we're going to have n times steps,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.650
the next time, we're going to have n - 1 times steps,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.530
the next time, we're going to have n - 2 times steps and so on,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.750
and the same basically also holds true for this inner loop here.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.540
So, if this is executed n times, then the inner loop here,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.690
again depending on how you count that is going to be executed n times or n - 1 times

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.390
So, these two parts here, that is exactly where you need the hit.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.940
So, it's two times this part here, so it's two times n² + n over 2.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.560
So, the total here is n² + n.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:41.300
So, the total number of times steps is 0 + n + n² + n which is n² + 2n which is O(n²).

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.440
Now, as you get more familiar with analyzing algorithms,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.550
you will actually see that having two inner loops usually leads with quadratic running time

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.390
and you wouldn't even have needed this extracted here.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.720
So, with more practice, the analysis of algorithms becomes easier and easier

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.780
and you will have to do less and less of the tedious single line counting.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.950
One final thing, of course, O(n³) is technically correct

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.940
but as I already mentioned when discussing big O notation,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.160
you want to bound  to be as tight as possible.

00:02:12.160 --> 99:59:59.000
This is really the only correct solution.
