00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.440
&gt;&gt; So it can be a little bit weird to talk about the truth value of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.600
an implication sentence. What we're really saying here is, whether or

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.830
not this implication actually holds true. So let's take

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.540
three different implications to see this. First let's think of the implication,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.260
feathers implies bird. All birds have feathers and only birds have feathers. So,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.730
we know that if an animal has feathers, then it is a bird. That's true.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.060
On the other hand, let's take the implication, if scales then bird. Lots of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
animals with scales aren't birds and in fact no animals with scales are birds.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.930
So the implication, scales implies birds. Would be False. For our third example,

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.640
let's take the implication, flight implies bird. If we have a penguin,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.180
flight is False. But the penguin is still a bird. So, flight can be false and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.740
bird can still be true, meaning the implication can still be true here.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.840
On the other hand, if we have a cat, flight if False. And bird is False.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.430
So, the implication can still be true. So in this case, if flight was false,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.670
we can't actually make a determination on whether or not the animal is a bird.
