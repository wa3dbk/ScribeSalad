00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.500
So in the DOS-like structure, the main

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.900
difference from the monolithic structure that I

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.430
showed you earlier is that the red

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.110
line separating the application from the operating system

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.730
is now replaced by a dotted line. What that means, the main difference is

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.810
there is no hard separation between the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.450
address space of the application And the address

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.150
space of the operating system. The good

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.259
news is an application can access all the

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.160
operating system services very quickly. As they would

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.460
any procedures that they may execute within their

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.260
own application with the same speed. At

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.760
memory speeds, an application can make calls into

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.050
the operating system and get system services. That's

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.570
the good news. But the bad news is

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.810
that there is no protection of the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.604
operating system from inerrant application. So, the

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:59.125
integrity of the operating system can be

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:03.830
compromised by a runaway application, either maliciously

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.360
or unintentionally corrupting the data structures that

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.050
are in the operating system. Now, you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.060
may wonder why DOS Chose this particular structure. Well, at least in the early

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.560
days of PC, it was thought that a personal computer, as the name

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.750
suggests, is a platform for a single user and, more importantly, the vision was,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.170
there will be exactly one app that is running at a time. Not even multitasking.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.670
So performance and simplicity was the key and protection was not primary concern

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.290
in the DOS-like structure. And that you can

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.760
get good performance comes from the simple observation

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.640
that there is No hard separation between the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.420
application and the operating system. The operating system

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.550
is not living in its own address space.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.060
The application and the operating system are in

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.750
the same address space. And therefore, making a

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.060
system call by an application is going to happen as

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.880
quickly as the application would call a procedure

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.560
which the application developer wrote himself or herself.
