00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.913
Onto the world of JavaScript.

00:00:01.913 --> 00:00:04.960
Concatenation here solves
two problems at once.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.200
First and foremost,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.650
it reduces a number of HTTP requests
needed to load your page in production.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.450
Which is a big deal, especially
if you're on a mobile connection

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.950
with up to 300 milliseconds
of latency per request.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.730
Secondly, it's the most basic
variant of dependency management.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.110
You put all your script
into a folder and

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.300
instead of having to add script blocks
to load them one by one into HTML,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.500
you simply add a single script
block that points to the generated

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.090
output file,
including all of them concatenated.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.430
I say most basic variant because it
obviously isn't smart enough to detect

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.140
dependency chains and
the required load order.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.910
But solving these problems
is a much harder task.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.750
let's keep it simple for now.
