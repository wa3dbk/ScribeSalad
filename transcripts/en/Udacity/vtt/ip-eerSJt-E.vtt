00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.546
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Remember that MathQuill is the tool that's allowing us to write many of the

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:07.373
things in this class really beautifully. So, and we want you to enter things

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.926
like x to the 4th over 2. It actually looks like this in the spot where you

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:14.599
input things. But as great and powerful as MathQuill is, there are a couple of

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.336
little idiosyncratic things that you should know about how to enter things.

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:22.470
Especially when it comes to using parentheses. You may have noticed that if you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.124
type one parentheses, one opening parentheses, that is, in a text box where

00:00:26.124 --> 00:00:30.064
MathQuill is being implemented, then the closing parentheses appears as well.

00:00:30.064 --> 00:00:33.833
And you'll be typing in this spot in the box in between them. This generally

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.352
makes your life much easier. But in certain situations, it can be kind of

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:41.527
tricky. One of these interesting, and potentially troublesome features, is that

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:45.427
once you have a set of parentheses, and then something written inside them, if

00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:49.327
you want to delete the parentheses but leave whatever you've written inside,

00:00:49.327 --> 00:00:53.227
then you can't have your cursor sitting out here and then press Delete because

00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:57.223
that will delete the entire expression. So let's say you'd written 26 m inside

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:01.223
parentheses. If you put your cursor right here and press Delete or Backspace,

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:05.614
everything would disappear. If instead, however, of having the cursor out here

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:09.457
to the right of the entire expression in the parentheses, you put the cursor

00:01:09.457 --> 00:01:13.364
just inside of opening parentheses, so just to the right of it. Then, you can

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:17.332
press Delete or Backspace or whatever your computer uses to get rid of things

00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:21.384
before the cursor. And that'll leave you with whatever was inside parentheses

00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:26.175
originally. I'd like you to get some practice in how this works using this

00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:30.740
expression right here. So once it comes time for you to take this quiz, I'd like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.644
you to type in 3 plus open parenthesis 2 x y minus 7 open parenthesis x z, and

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:40.892
then two close parenthesis. And then, in as few keystrokes as possible, change

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:46.146
this to just 3 plus 2 x y minus 7 x z. So, this is just giving you a chance to

00:01:46.146 --> 00:01:50.956
figure out how to delete parentheses without deleting expressions that were

00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:51.986
inside of them.
