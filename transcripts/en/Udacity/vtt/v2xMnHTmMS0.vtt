00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.800
Now that you have seen what data dependencies

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.530
look like, let's do a data dependencies quiz

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.840
to see if you can find data dependencies

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.500
in the program. Let's say that these are

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.634
four instructions in our program. Instruction one multiplies

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:16.880
R2 and R3, puts the result in R1.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.076
Instruction two takes R4 and R1, adds them

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:25.580
up, and puts the result in R4. Instruction three

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.510
multiplies R5 and R6, puts the result in R1. And the subtract here, instruction

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.290
four, subtracts R1 from R4 and puts the result back in R4. You need to indicate

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.130
whether there are any dependencies between instruction

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.209
I1 and I2. For each of these three

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:48.350
types of dependencies, is there such a dependence?

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.390
You need to do that also for I1

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.670
to I3, I1 to I4. So is there a dependence from I1 to I4?

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.215
And from I2 to I3. To help you out, I'm going to tell you that there is a

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.370
read after write dependence here. That there is

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.410
no write after read dependence from I1 to

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.200
I2. And that there is no write after

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.230
write dependence. I'm also going to tell you that

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.159
there is no read after write dependence here. But

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.140
you need to figure out the remaining eight dependencies.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.670
Put a check mark in each of these boxes

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.270
if there is such a dependence between these instructions.
