00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
So congratulations!

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.650
We have now shown that any problem that is in NP

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.080
of size n can be transformed

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.130
into a SAT problem with size polynomial in n.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.470
And what that means is

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.920
that SAT is NP complete.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.720
Now I know that it was a lot of work

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.210
to prove this and you can be proud of yourself

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.070
for staying along,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.330
and I actually have to thank Steven Cook and Leonid Levin,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.940
because thanks to their work, I already know how to do the proof.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.810
Just imagine what they must have gone through

00:00:32.810 --> 99:59:59.000
before they come up with this.
