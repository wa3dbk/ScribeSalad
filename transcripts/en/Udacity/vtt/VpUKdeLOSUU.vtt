00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.778
To solve this problem, we can, once again,
use this trick that we learned earlier. We

00:00:04.778 --> 00:00:10.211
have two factors inside this term that
have the same base. So, we have y^4 and

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:12.853
y^-2.
So, I'm going to start by writing those

00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:18.343
next to each other. And now, we know that
y^4 times y^-2, is just going to be equal to

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:24.546
y^4+-2.
So, I rewrite the x^2 factor and we have

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:33.453
y^4+-2, which is the same as 4- 2power.
4-2 is just 2, so our final answer is x^2

00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:34.484
y^2.
