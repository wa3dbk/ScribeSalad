00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, finally, what about Bob, who is solving Shortest Tour?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, Shortest Tour is a problem that hasn't been investigated that much.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In the general case, for it's closely related problem, Travelling Salesman,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we don't know.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But there are many special cases of this problem

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
where good approximations are actually possible.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But the bounds of approximation for Shortest Tour and Travelling Salesman

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
have actually not been investigated that much.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So if you're really into it, that will be a possible area for research.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Although, it seems to be quite hard to actually transfer the results

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
from here over to Shortest Tour.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So maybe we can make Alice a little bit less happy;

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
although, she has been quite lucky in this course.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
She has a constant factor approximation algorithm,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the limit of 1.36 probably doesn't affect her that much.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And Bob, well, it's not really clear if he should be happy or not,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but as we mentioned, in practice it's likely

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that his problem is actually very well solvable.
