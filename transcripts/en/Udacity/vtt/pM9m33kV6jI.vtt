00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's an example for you to take a look at.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is a graph and we're trying to get from point A to B which is often what we do in graphs,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and you can see here I've actually annotated the edges of the graph with weights

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and we're trying to find the shortest path where the length is measured as the sum of these weights.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And when you figured that out, write the length of the path in the box here.
