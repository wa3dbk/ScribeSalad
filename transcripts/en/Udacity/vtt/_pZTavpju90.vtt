Cognitive psychologists suggest that we use mental representations to represent

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.760
our knowledge, memories, or ideas in order to store and maintain our mental

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.489
processes. Mental representation is defined as a structure in our mind, such as

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:20.720
an idea or image. That stands for something else. Such that an external object,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.694
or things that was sensed in the past or future. But whatever it is, it's not

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:30.012
something in the present. These mental representations, allow us to think about

00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:35.004
things that are abstract, and have no physical existence. Earlier in this

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.600
lesson when we talked about language, we asked about love and passion. We can

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.816
also include things such as truth or justice, as abstract ideas that we can

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:49.863
represent in our mind visually and verbally. So visual imagery involves visual

00:00:49.863 --> 00:00:54.285
representations created by the brain after the original stimulus is no longer

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:59.360
present. Now if you recall, the visual system is mostly located in the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.580
occipital occipital lobes. One interesting thing to note is that while we're

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
visualizing something, our brain is active in much of the same ways it is

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.105
during visual perception. That is, visual imagery has similar brain activity to

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:16.924
visual perception. In fact, because of this, if you imagine doing your very

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:22.462
best at a task, it may actually help you improve in your performance. Sports

00:01:22.462 --> 00:01:26.053
psychologists are aware of this, and use visualization techniques to help

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:30.584
improve athlete's performance. Researchers have noted that both visual

00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:34.244
imagination and visual imagery are the most important to many creative

00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:37.990
accomplishments, both in science and in art.
