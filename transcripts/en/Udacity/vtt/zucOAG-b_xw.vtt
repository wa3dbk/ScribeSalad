00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Test-case reduction is the process of taking some large input

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that triggers a failure and turning it into a small input.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's usually the case that many bugs can be triggered by small inputs.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
On the other hand, it's often the case that, for example, we discover a Firefox crash,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the web page that causes the Firefox crash might be giant. It's probably huge.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We discover this bug in the wild, and statistically speaking, the pattern in this input

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that triggers the Firefox crash just probably isn't going to be found on some small web page.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What we can do is, by hand, figure out what part of the input causes the test case.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
One thing we can do is eliminate part of the input.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Sometimes we do this in a smart way.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For example, we might just know that some part of it is unlikely to trigger a crash,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
or we might just chop some of it out blindly and see if the smaller input triggers the test case.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If it doesn't, then we got back to our original test case and try again.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If it does, we proceed. Now maybe it's this part.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If we're really lucky, at the very end of this process, we'll end up with a really small test case.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's the thing we'd like to report to the people developing the software under test.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Of course, even if we're not reporting bugs to someone else--

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that is to say, we're finding bugs in software that we wrote--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
it's still really nice to have a minimized test case,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because these make it much easier to track down failures.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Option one--manual reduction.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This has been done by people debugging for probably

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
about as long as computer science has been around.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The second option is really cool. It's a really, really nice technique.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's called "delta debugging," and it automates this process.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If you can write a program that can tell automatically if a particular input triggers a failure--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that is to say, you load up the webpage in Firefox

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and you'll see if it crashes by looking at the exit code that it provides

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to the operating system.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Then delta debugging is a framework that takes your script

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and takes the test input and automates this process in a loop,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and this loop terminates when the delta debugger,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which has a bunch of heuristics built in for eliminating parts of the input,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it terminates when this delta debugger can't reduce the input anymore.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What I don't want to do is going into this technique in a ton of detail,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
because the guy who developed the delta debugging is going

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to be teaching a Udacity class sometime soon,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and it's probably going to be really interesting.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What I hope is that I've intrigued you enough that you'll really serious consider taking his class.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It's going to be about debugging. What I'd rather do now is show you an example.
