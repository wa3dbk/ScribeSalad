00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.990
So, here's a, an interesting example.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.340
This is a great old slide.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.360
I think this slide is actually from
The Psychology of Computer Vision book

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.170
by Pat Winston,
which I think was 1975, I don't know.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.600
It's just such a cool because they,
it was before we could do any,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.880
it's just beautiful.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.470
Anyway, so, the idea is here
is the image on the left and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.480
another image on the right.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.970
And the question is taken
at time one and time two.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.320
How are things moving?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.830
Well if I just look at these two
pictures, it's a little hard to tell.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.229
But if I give you the flow field,
it's very clear what's going on.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.780
Right?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.840
What's going on is the camera
is moving forward.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.556
Right?
The camera is moving forward,

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.279
which is inducing this flow field.

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:40.100
All right?

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.350
And that's the flow field of a plane.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.070
That's going to be a Homography.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.360
And there is another flow field here and
you realize this thing called a Demon.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.360
And that's whats so cute because back in
the old days in AI when you had little

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.520
list programs running
in the background and,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.850
and, little things would run on their
own and have their own behavior.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.740
They were called demons,
so this is a lisp joke.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.650
Anyway, so you can see this demon is
actually just a planar cardboard thing

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.490
that is moving sort of forward and
to your right it's left.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.930
You can see that from the flow field,
and

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.910
if you cut up this image into this area.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.660
And then that area, you would
have two different flow fields,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.910
both of which would be homographies.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.740
So, they would both be modelable flow.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.570
All right?

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.280
So, I'm going to show you
a couple different things.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.800
Some is more math, some is, less math.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.760
But, it's basically the mathematics
behind modeled flow.
