00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.750
So, we started this course by exploring X Code.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.620
In lesson 2, we learned how to add different visual elements to our app.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.250
Things like buttons, images and label.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.360
We also learned, how to control or manipulate them, using Actions and outlets.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.940
In this lesson, lesson three, we will accomplish, three main things.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.120
We will learn how to play, audio from our app.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.510
We will also tinker with the speed of the audio,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.690
to make it play really fast or really slowly.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.940
And finally, we will also figure out how to navigate between

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.050
different screens of our app.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.490
The next lesson, will be all about recording audio and

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.700
adding effects like chipmunk and Darth Vader
