00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.050
UIKit is a big library.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.420
We won't be covering all of its classes,
but we've selected a path through

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.360
the material that will give you
a strong foundation to build on.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.330
We'll be covering, outlets and actions,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.230
presenting view controllers,
delegates, tables, navigation, and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.350
we'll wrap up with some skills you'll
need specifically for the MemeMe app.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.150
In this first lesson we want
to take a close look at

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.640
each object that's
used to create an app.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.880
We'll write an app entirely in code, and

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.490
then we'll see how storyboard can
be used to replace that code.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.270
To begin, let's develop a way to diagram
objects, so that we can visualize our

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630
apps' components and
see how they're connected.
