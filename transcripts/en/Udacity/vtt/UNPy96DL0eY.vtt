00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.977
You're really mastering division, if you got 3x plus 7. First we think about

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:10.097
what number times 5x, would give us 15x squared, that must be 3x, 3x times 5x is

00:00:10.097 --> 00:00:15.011
15x squared, and 3x times negative 4 is negative 12x. Now we subtract this

00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:20.702
expression, which changes both of the signs. 15x Squared minus 15x squared is 0,

00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:26.162
and 23x plus 12x is 35x, we bring down the negative 28 to continue our long

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:31.922
division. Repeating our process one more time, we want to think about what

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:37.824
number times 5 x gives us 35 x? That should be positive 7. Positive 7 times 5x,

00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:43.370
is 35x, and positive 7 times negative 4 is negative 28. We subtract this

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.442
expression, which changes both of the signs, this leaves us with a remainder of

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:52.108
0, so our final answer is 3x plus 7.
