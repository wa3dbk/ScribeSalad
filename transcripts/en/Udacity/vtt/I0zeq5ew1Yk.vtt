00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.230
Okay, now that we have looked at how to
write sentences in the language of logic

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.330
and also looked at how to
rewrite the sentences, for

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.380
example by eliminating implication,
let us now look at

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.780
what kinds of rules of inference can
be implied and how can we apply them.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.570
One rule of inference is
called Modus Ponens, and

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.100
many of you may already
be familiar with it.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.608
If I'm given a sentence s1
which says p implies q, and

00:00:26.608 --> 00:00:31.909
another sentence S2 which says p,
then I could infer q from it.

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:37.870
p implies q and p, therefore q,
this symbol stands for therefore.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.770
Let's take an example, so imagine that
I'm given that feathers imply bird.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.320
And I'm also given
that feathers is true.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.130
Then, I can infer that
bird must be true.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.590
Now we can connect
this to a logic agent.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.480
Imagine that there is a robot and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.360
I bootstrap that robot with
the knowledge that feathers imply bird.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.260
Now the robot goes to a new
region in the country and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.550
finds some animal which has feathers.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.200
The robot cannot conclude that
that particular animal is a bird.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.579
So the first sentence came from
something that I had bootstrapped into

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:14.960
the knowledge of the robot.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.440
The second sentence came from
the percepts of the robot.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.740
And the third sentence came
from its logical inferencing.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.580
And this is how the robot can,
in fact, go about making sound,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.020
complete inferences that
are guaranteed to be correct.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.820
Here is a second rule of inference,
this is called Modus Tollens.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.940
So again I have sentence S1, p implies
q, and I have a second sentence, not q.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.180
And therefore,
I can inference that not p.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.710
So let us take an example
of Modus Tollens.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.460
Imagine that there is a robot
that has been programmed,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.620
bootstrapped with the knowledge
feathers imply bird.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.010
So that's part of its
knowledge base already.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.910
This robot goes to a new country and is
talking to the people in that country,

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.430
and the people tell the robot a story
about an animal that is not a bird.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.300
Therefore the robot may infer that
that animal must not have feathers.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.860
So this is coming from
the knowledge that is bootstrapped.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.450
This is coming from the new
percept from the story.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.900
And this is coming from
the logical inference.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.610
And once again, the logical inference
is guaranteed to be sound and complete.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.470
&gt;&gt; You may already be familiar with
this line of reasoning because this is

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.730
another way of phrasing
a contrapositive,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.120
that we see in other areas of logic.
