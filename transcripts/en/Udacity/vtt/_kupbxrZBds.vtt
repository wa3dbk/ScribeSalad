00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.280
Okay so now I want to pick this up

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.390
and talk about the project operator. So a couple of

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.720
things to note about project, we can use project to

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.250
include fields from the original document. Remember that project works

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.890
with data in a single document at a time. And

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.980
we're essentially doing a shaping task with project. So the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.770
simplest form of shaping, is simply specifying which fields from

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.280
each of the documents we're receiving in the stage using

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.430
project, we would like to include and pass along

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.650
to the next stage. One really cool thing we can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.860
do with project, is insert computed fields. So, for

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.680
example, a ratio, which is what we're going to do

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.270
for this particular example we're working through. We might

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.860
also rename fields. And finally, we can do some pretty

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.610
substantial reshaping of the data, by doing something like

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.540
creating fields that hold subdocuments that are composed of what

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.120
were originally top level fields in the documents,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.400
as they came into the stage using the project

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.990
operator. So let's go back to our code,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.930
and look at how we're using project here. Remember,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.510
the problem we're trying to solve here is,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.540
addressing the question who has the highest followers to

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.030
friends ratio? So here, it's pretty straight forward, we're

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.430
simply pulling out the screen name field of the

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.312
user sub-document. Okay? And again, we use this

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:22.430
$ here, because rather than this being interpreted

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.090
as just a string literal, we're telling mongoDB

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.640
that we want the value. For each document

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.510
that's found in the user sub-document and in

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.300
the screen name field. Okay? So, in documents

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.790
that get passed along from this particular stage,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.500
they will have a screen name field composed of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.180
that value for each document that we received

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.530
as input here. Okay, now let's look at this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.690
portion of the projected stage here. So we're going

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.640
to create a ratio field and documents that come

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.170
out of this particular stage. And that ratio

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.690
field is going to have the value of having

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.660
divided the followers count by the friends count, so

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.530
quite literally, calculating this ratio here. Again, remember friends,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.400
in the documents we're looking at here, are the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.670
number of people that I follow as opposed to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.570
people who follow me. Okay, so again, diving into

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.390
the user sub-document, we're going to pull out the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.210
followers account, and the friends account. Again making use

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.330
of the dollar operator here to indicate we actually

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.990
want the values of each of these. And then

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.620
we're going to use the divide operator to calculate the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.210
ratio of these two values. It's that value

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.660
then, that will make up the value of the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.610
ratio field in each document that gets passed

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.790
along from this stage using the project operator. Okay,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.670
so when we get to this stage all

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.970
documents will have exactly two fields: ratio and screen

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.350
name. And then we're simply going to sort in

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.450
descending order based on ratio, and then of course,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.350
limit to just the very first document that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.880
we see. So let's run this. Okay, and again.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.440
Our output from an aggregation inquiry is always

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.210
a single document. The results we're really interested in

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.740
are always in the result field, which is an array value field. Okay? So,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.650
in this case, user in our tweets collection that has the highest

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.360
followers to friends ratio, is a user called Twitterific.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.670
' Kay, turns out this is actually a Twitter application,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.590
and even today if you look at Twitterific's page on Twitter,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.120
you'll see that they have something on the order of nearly

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.020
half a million followers. But they only follow about 14 people,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.120
so their followers to friends count ratio is still extremely high.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.800
So again, in this example, we focused on the $ match

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.740
operator, which is just a filter, the $project operator, which is

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.410
a shaping operator, we actually have lots of things that we

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.210
can do here. And the sort and limit operators. So

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.600
in this case we've got four stages of our pipeline.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.380
Now one thing before I wrap this up, is I

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.380
just want to quickly point out that we can build a

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.800
variety of expressions using the Project operator. If we take

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.180
a look at the MongoDB documentation, there are a number

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.120
of arithmetic operators that we can apply, as well as

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.370
a number of string operators, date operators and so on.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.529
So this is the aggregation expression operators page in the docs. I encourage

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.649
you to look here for more information on the different types of operators

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.590
that are available to you when working with Project, as well as the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.430
other aggregation framework operators. See the instructor

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.740
notes for a link to this page.
