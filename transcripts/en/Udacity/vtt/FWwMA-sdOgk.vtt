00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.980
When we said that the framework didn't want us

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.080
to run network operations on the main thread, what

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.630
is the main thread? Well, Android apps run by

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.570
default on the main thread, also called the UI thread.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.900
It handles all the user input as well as

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.060
the output, such as screen drawing. Thus we want

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.760
to avoid any time-consuming operations here, otherwise the URI

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.470
is going to stutter. Instead, kick off a background worker

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.430
thread if you have to do some long-running

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.170
work. This includes doing network calls, decoding bitmaps, or

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.870
reading, and writing from the database. Okay. So, somehow,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.890
we have to move the networking code off the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.800
main thread. But how are we going to do

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.180
that? Well there are several options, but let's look

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.610
for the name of the Android class that simplifies

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.520
background thread creation and UI thread synchronization, so that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.370
the results from the background work will come back onto the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.710
main thread, and then we can use it to update our

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.740
UI. Search online and figure out the answer to this question

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.740
and then enter the class name in the box. Here's some

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.950
advice for you. If you ever get stuck on how to

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.480
do something in Android and you can't find it on the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.220
developer's site you can try to check stackoverflow.com. It's a question

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.740
and answer site that many Android developers use as a valuable resource.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.700
So chances are likely that someone has

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.850
already asked a similar question that you have.
