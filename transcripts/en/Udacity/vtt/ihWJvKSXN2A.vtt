00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.880
In the previous example you
got a map into your app

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.630
without writing a single
line of Java code.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.090
Now wasn't that cool?

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.185
You did it by using an XML based
description of the map in a fragment.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:14.785
Because this is XML,

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:19.265
you can use properties to set up
your map without using any code.

00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:23.075
So, for example, by setting a few
properties we can create a map

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:25.915
that shows us a flyover
of New York City.

00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:26.575
Let's give it a shot.
