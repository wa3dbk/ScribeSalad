00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's try out some of these ideas with the flexible rope.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We'll fix both ends of that rope

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and want to see what the equilibrium shape is going to be

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
under the influence of gravity.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The obvious choice of finite elements is springs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Springs of a given rest length, so that the potential energy of each spring

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
amounts to 1/2 times the spring constant times the square of the extension of the spring,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which is the distance between the two endpoints minus the rest length of the string.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
To model the mass of that rope, we attach mass points to these strings.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Of course, these mass points carry potential energy due to gravity.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Given the constants that we provide, compute the potential energy of that rope.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The one end of that rope will be fixed at x = 0, y = 0.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The other end of that rope will be fixed at x = 1.3 m and y = 0.4 m.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Our code starts with a random initialization

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and then applies a pretty simplistic strategy to minimize the energy.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
For a certain number of times it's going to pick one of the masses

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and change the position of that mass point by a random vector.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If the energy decreases, it keeps that new position.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If it doesn't, it returns to the position before.

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Very simple, but highly inefficient.
