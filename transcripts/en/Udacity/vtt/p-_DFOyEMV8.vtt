00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.950
Okay, so what does a graph look like?

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.420
Wait.
No.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.189
I've been conditioned to think of
a graph as a chart that shows trends,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.720
like a line graph, or
a graph of a function.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.860
But that's not what we're
talking about here.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.580
Let me try again.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.470
Our definition of a graph
looks more like this.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.669
The purpose of a graph is to show
how different things are connected

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.400
to one another.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.790
It's also sometimes called a network.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.396
A graph is similar to
a tree in many ways.

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:32.750
For starters, these are called nodes or
vertices, and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.415
these lines over here are called edges.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:39.565
In fact, a tree is just a more
specific type of graph.

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:42.785
It's just like a binary
tree is a type of tree, and

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.985
a BST is a type of binary tree.

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:49.785
Here's an example of a valid graph,
where you can really start anywhere and

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:52.735
you'll follow some
path back to the start.

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.300
Since cycles like this one are possible,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.669
graphs don't really have
a root node like trees do.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.360
Graphs are really vaguely defined,
but we should keep it that way.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.580
As you've probably come to expect,
we need to keep it vague so

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.900
our definition will encompass all of
the different use cases for our graph.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.750
For example, I would love to
say that nodes are the parts of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.920
graphs that store data, and edges
are just the connections between them.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.940
But, edges can actually store data too.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.500
Since graphs can seem really
abstract at the start,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.660
let's make them more
concrete with some examples.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.550
Let's imagine this graph
as a social network.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.440
This node can be me.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.890
I can draw the rest of
the graph like this.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.620
Here, it's clear that nodes are people,
but

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.850
the edges between the nodes could be
describing any connection between us.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.460
Maybe it's people who've met each other.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.919
Here, two notes that
are connected by an edge,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.870
sometimes called adjacent,
have met each other in person.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.110
This could be a graph of people who've
lived in the same city at the same time,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.670
or people who've worked
on a project together.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.840
The nodes could contain
any amount of data,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.870
like each person's full name, where
they live now, their birthday, etc.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.470
As I said before,
edges could contain data, too.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.300
Edges often contain data about
the strength of a connection.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.820
For example,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.829
these edges could show how many times in
the past week we talked to each other.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.590
Okay, let's think about a new example.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.300
Let's say this graph is my
travel plans for a big trip.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.700
I'm going to fly from San Francisco
to Tokyo, then Kuala Lumpur,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.589
then Delhi, then back to KL,
Tokyo, and SF.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.110
The edges could contain no information,
or

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.510
they could contain how
long the flights are.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.299
The information I decide to store will
depend on what I'm using this graph for.
