Well, I'd certainly check car and person. Those are nouns, they're current in

00:00:05.732 --> 00:00:11.970
the problem description. drive is a verb, so that probably wouldn't work out.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.721
And now car sharing, yes it is a noun, but how would a car sharing class help

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:24.052
us? What would an object of class carsharing look like? So, that's not so

00:00:24.052 --> 00:00:29.844
clear. So, this is just a technique to give us some candidates for classes, so

00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:35.377
that one can get started designing a solution. It's not perfect but it's pretty

00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:39.555
useful. Now, I want to shift focus a bit and talk about the challenges of

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:42.230
implementing a single class.
