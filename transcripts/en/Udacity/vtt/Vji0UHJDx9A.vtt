00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.310
We need to consider a few issues
when we use RSA in practice.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.755
First, for
given key the same plain text message

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:11.580
will always be encrypted
into same ciphertext.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.764
A related issue is that for
some special-case plaintexts,

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:20.357
such as zero, one or minus one,
the ciphertexts are always zero,

00:00:20.357 --> 00:00:24.050
one or minus one regardless of the keys.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.930
These shortcomings allow
the attacker to know

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.760
the plaintext even though
he doesn't know the key.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.710
Another issue is that RSA is manageable.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.100
That is if the attacker transforms
a ciphertext into another, it would

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.810
produce a predictable transformation
of the decrypted plaintext.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.620
Suppose Bob sends Alice a encrypted
message using Alice's public key.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.260
The attacker intercepts the ciphertext.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.740
Then the attacker
changes the ciphertext.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.150
Then when Bob receives
this modified ciphertext,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.790
he's going to decrypt it
as s times m instead of m.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.130
That is, the attacker has the ability to
change the ciphertext in such a way that

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.710
it would produce predictable
effect on the decrypted plaintext.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.050
In this case, the plain text
is increased by a factor of S.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.510
In practice,
the standard uses some sort of padding.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.360
That is, add some random
bytes as prefix to m, and

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.970
this addresses the issues
that we just discussed.
