00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's time to introduce a new regular expression--plus.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is really handy when we want to match one or more of something.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is a very concise way of listing, actually, an infinite number of possibilities.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If I write the regular expression "a" followed by a plus, it matches "a," "aa," "aaa," "aaaa."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The plus looks back to the previous regular expression and changes the meaning.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Instead of just matching that once, you match it once or more--as many times as you'd like.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Here I've shown another example. We're looking for 0 through 1 repeated one or more times.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The interpretation here is every time you repeat you can make a different choice.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This matches "0" and "1," "00" and "11," but also "01."

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This required us to pick a 0 the first time and a 1 the second time.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That's totally fine with the plus.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"1010" is a favorite year of mine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's about when Murasaksi Shikibu wrote The Tale of Genji.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
She is often credited with writing the first novel--the first psychological novel,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
although this is the subject of some dispute.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There is a minor bit of ambiguity I need to clear up with this plus.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Let's say that we're looking for numbers 0 through 9 plus in the string "13 from 1 in 1776."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
One possible answer is 13, 1, and 1776,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but this plus just means 1 or more.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Is there anything that says that I have to match them all at the same time

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
or could I break up 1776 into four different one-letter strings.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It turns out that there is a rule in regular expressions called "maximal munch,"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which says that a regular expression should consume, or eat, or match

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the biggest string it can and not smaller parts.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So we and Python and other people studying regular expressions are going to get this answer:

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
13, 1, 1776, because 1776 is the maximal munch we can get here for 0 through 9 plus.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Don't stop early. Go all the way.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
All right. Let's get a little more practice with compound regular expression matching,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
including the plus.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Down here I've written a regular expression dot findall expression in Python

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and a bunch of possible answers.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'd like you to check the ones that could be elements of the return value of this Python expression.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We're looking for 0 through 9 followed by--oh, what does this mean?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I haven't shown this to you yet.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We just have open brackets, a space, and a closed bracket.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That means just match space.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Then finally 0 through 9 plus.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Remember the plus only applies to this last 0 through 9.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We're looking for all of these in that torture string I made up earlier.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.154
Let's try it out.
