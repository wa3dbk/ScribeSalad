00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is the final exam homework solution.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's talk about the basic version first without the bonus problem.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The basic version was to have a basic wiki.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is the front page. Of course there are other pages you can go to.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If they exist, you see the content.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If they don't exist, for example /foo, you would see an edit page.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But I wasn't logged in so we won't see an edit page.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's try that again.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If you try to visit an edit page when you're not logged in,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it should redirect you to the login page.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So I go to a page that doesn't exist--foo. Now I'm logged in.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We can see I put the user name in the upper right here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Then we get an edit page, and if we save this page, you can see we can now

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
go to /foo and we can see this content.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We go back to our front page and all is well&gt;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We've got logging in and logging out. All that works.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's take a peak at the code.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, this actually wasn't a whole lot of code to get a pretty functional wiki.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
A lot of this code you've already seen before.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Oh, there's my secret. I guess I'll change that before I upload this.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
All of this code is basically from previous homeworks.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I've actually given you most of this code.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Here's my normal render<u>str function and my make</u>secure_val for the cookie stuff

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and check<u>secure</u>val.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I added this new function called gray_style, and we'll come back to this for

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the bonus question but this is just a little function I wrote

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to alternate the coloring of rows in the UI.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't know if there's a better way to do this or not, but this is how I did it,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
using something that would work in Jinja, the templating language,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that I could figure out how to do otherwise.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
All of these functions--remember this is our superclass Handler

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that we've been using for all of our handlers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
None of this stuff has changed.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I've added it to my render_str function, I make it sow in templates

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so I always have access to a variable called user, which just references self.user.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I have access to the function gray_style, which is that function I just pointed out.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We'll come back to that.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Everything else in here is actually the same.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
These are all basically how I left it after the end of Unit 4, really.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You can see there is still some security stuff in there.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I had made it so only spez could submit to the blog,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and this variable isn't used in this program anymore. It's just leftover.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I made a new 404 page so I could call self.notFound,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and it'll actually say 404. That was something that I found kind of useful.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We've got all the solved and valid password and hashing functions.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This was all, again from really Unit 4 homework.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The user code hasn't changed at all.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The same stuff I demoed there.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The SignupHandler is just about identical from Unit 2 and Unit 4 where we did the registration.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The same form and the same validation. You've seen all this code before.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The login is all basically the same.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The only real change--actually, let's go back up to signup.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'm using the refer to keep track of what URL the form should go to after you submit it.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Before we render the form, I create this variable next_url,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
which uses the refer header, which is sent along with every request.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That's the page you are on before you went to this page.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
If I was on '/', and I clicked on login to go to /login,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
the refer would be '/', and then of course I have it default to '/'.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That gets sent in to the form as an input type hidden,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and the URL to go to next after we're done signing in or logging in

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
gets passed in the form, and you can see that document here.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
This is the signup handler.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
In the post for that I look for next_url in the requests, and if it's there

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and if it's not login, because I don't want to have somebody signup and then immediately

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
redirect them to /login. That came up during testing.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If that parameter wasn't there or it's /login we just go to '/'.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Otherwise, next_url we've validated everything

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and we redirect the user to next_url when they're done registering.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That allows somebody to click signup on any page,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and then once they sign up we take them back to that page.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's just an extra kind of nice little convenience.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
The login handler is almost identical to Unit 4 as well except it has the same

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
next_url functionality.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We get the referer header. I send that to my login form. I include it as an input type hidden.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Then we redirect to it when the user logs in successfully.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The rest of the code is the same from the Unit 4 homework.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Login is basically the same except it also has a next_url.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It just again looks at the refer and redirects the user to that.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Now, I should probably clean this up a little bit.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We've seen this exact line--this next<u>url = self.request.headers next</u>url--in three different places.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It'd probably pull that up into the handler, but this code is kind of a work-in-progress.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You're seeing it here in a little bit of a raw state.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
This is my page class. The page model is pretty simple.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It just has content, a created time, and a last_modified time.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I also wanted to have a notion of an author of what user created a particular page,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
but it actually wasn't relevant to the demo, so didn't bother finishing the implementation,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but it would have looked something like this.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
You can see, again, this code is kind of in a working state,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and actually what is online right now might differ from what I'm explaining here,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
because I've had a few more weeks to work on it to make it a little prettier.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You may see this feature implemented when I release the code,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
or you may see this line be gone altogether.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Now, I've added a couple of class methods.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Some of you actually asked about this in some of the previous homeworks--

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
what staticmethod and classmethod do.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Staticmethod basically means you don't have to pass in self to a function,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
which means this method here is just static.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It doesn't run on an instance of the class.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's just basically a way of organizing your code a little bit better.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
This function parent key is only going to be called in the context of a page,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
so I just basically say this parent key function belongs to the page

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and that's how we're going to reference it in our code,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but it doesn't actually take an instance of the class self

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
or the class itself like class.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It operates kind of independent.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What this function is actually doing is to make the history function work.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is a little trickery there.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I'll come back and explain this in a little bit more detail when I explain

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
the solution to the bonus problem.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Then I added two class methods.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
One is by_path for looking up a page by URL, which is kind of the default way of looking something up.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
All this does is this runs an app engine query or datastore query.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is a class method and what class method does is it says instead of running by_path

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
on and instance of page, run it on page itself--just the definition.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
You can say Page.by_path, give it a path, and it will return a query object.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Basically what this is say is get me all the pages for this URL sorted by creation time.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That's kind of how I did versioning.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I'll come back to that in more detail again when I talk about the bonus problem.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Of course looking up Page.by_id--this is strictly for the bonus problem--

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
looking up older versions of a page, so if you want to look it up by id

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in addition to the path, that's what this function is for.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
NoSlash is a special handler for getting rid of extra slashes in the URL.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It was kind of a work-in-progress. It wasn't working in this demo.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I'm going to have to come back and clean that up. Just ignore that for now.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Here is the EditPage handler. EditPage is the handler for actually editing one of the wikI pages.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
First thing we do is we check to see if the user is logged in.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
If the user is not logged in, we redirect to /login.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
That's important because you don't want non-logged in users to be editing your pages.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
They should be registered, so you know who's doing what.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This code here is for the bonus problem.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
If you didn't do the bonus problem, all you need to really do is look up a page.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
This is that by_path function that I just explained on the path object.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We give it the path, and then we get the page object.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You can structure this however you like.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
What that by_path function returns is a query and on a query datastore

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
you can either call get to get the first element of the query or you can call fetch to get multiple ones.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I'm calling get, because I only want the first one.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Then we render edit.html with that page, and we include that path

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
so I can render some of the links that appear in the navigation section.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Here's the definition of a post for the edit page.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Again we check to see if the user exists.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Now you may say, well, if the user didn't exist, how did they view the edit page?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Well, they could have a couple tabs open or multiple browser windows open.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
If they log out on and then submit a form in the other that could cause some problems.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
What we do is if the user is not logged in we just return a error 400,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
which is basically a bad request, and return.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I didn't do anything user friendly here because that shouldn't happen.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It just kind of silently fails.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Then what we do is we look for the actual content in the request.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Then we look up an old version of the page.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Then we have this little thing here.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Basically, if there wasn't an old version of the page, you're creating a new page,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and there wasn't any content--just return.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I'll probably expand this to have an error message,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
but we left out a little undefined in the problem.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I hadn't implemented it right away and so right now we're just kind of ignoring that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Otherwise, if we either don't have a page and have content, which is what this clause implies,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
or we do have a page and the content has changed.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I make a new instance of page.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Now, depending on whether or not you did the bonus problem,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
you could have edited an old version of the page.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
In mine, I want to keep this version history, so I create a new page for every change.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Then we store that in the database.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Then we redirect to just the path without the _edit,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
so you can actually view the content.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I'll skip the history page handler, but it's actually pretty simple.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
We'll come back to that in a second.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
WikiPage is the handler for actually viewing any pages on the Wiki.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It takes a path argument just like the edit page does.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Notice it's only get. There's no post here.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
This code here is identical to the edit page, and so again, I'll probably clean this up.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
This basically decides whether you're looking at an old version of Page with the version number

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
or the most recent version of the page.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
If you didn't do the bonus problem all you need is something like this.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
This says just look up the most recent version on the page.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
If it exists, we render page.html with that page.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I also include the path so I can render those links.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
If it doesn't exist, I redirect this /_edit plus the path.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So how do I do all the URL handling? It's actually pretty simple.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
What I did is I created a regular expression to match what I think is a valid URL&gt;

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Basically, it has to start with "/" and then it contains one or more

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
of the following characters--little a through little z, big A through big Z, 0 through 9,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
underscore, and dash--followed by an optional slash

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and then as many of those clauses as you want.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
That basically means slash is valid and then any number of these clauses

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
is valid after that. Then our URL handlers look something like this.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So /signup goes to Signup handler, /login Login, /logout Logout.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
These are all handlers you've seen from Unit 4.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
This was my NoSlash thing that is currently not working so I commented it out.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Now, remember these URL get matched in order.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
You want to make sure that this handler here or this regular expression

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000
for rendering a wiki page would actually also capture the history URL and the edit URL,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
so we need to put those history URL and the edit URL first so they get matched first.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
What this one says here is it says if the URL is of the form /_history

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
plus this regular expression--basically /_history/anything--

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
match the history page.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
If the URL is /_edit, basically anything, go to the edit page,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and if it's anything else, go to the wiki page.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
That's how we go to one of those three handlers.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
If we take a look at the app again in the browser now that we have seen the code,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
some things will make a little bit more sense.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
When you just go to "/" we go through our URL matcher,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and we say, okay, it doesn't match login, signup, or logout.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
It doesn't start with <u>history or</u>edit, so we match the other thing.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Our path now becomes "/" and then we look up using our database query the page for "/".

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
We get this page.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
If I were to go /newpage, we do the same thing.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
We use this as the key into our database, and we look up the most recent version of newpage.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Here it is.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Now, let's talk about editing a page.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I'm not logged in, so I don't have my edit link.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Let's go ahead and log in, so we can see the edit link.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Here I am on newpage. Now I'm logged in as spez. I have my edit link.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I'll show you those templates in a moment.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
When I click on edit, you can actually see it basically links to _edit/newpage.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It basically inserts an _edit here.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Remember that goes through our edit handler instead of the normal wiki handler.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
When I visit this link, the edit handler draws the different form, which gives us this whole form.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I'll just click save here. It didn't change the content, so we didn't create a new version.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
That's how edit works.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Now, of course, we can go to any URL.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It matches the wiki handler first. Let's look at the wiki handler again.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This wiki handler first--remember if the page, if it doesn't exist,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
we redirect to /_edit plus the path.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
The path is passed in by this regular expression.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
We'll go back to our browser.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
What's going to happen is we're going to redirect to _edit this string.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
There we go. That works.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Now, what if I go something like this.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Actually, let's take a page that already exists. Will this work? Yes.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
We get the edit page on this URL.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Remember, our regular expression just basically matches any number of things.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
We can actually create a whole complicated URL structure. That's pretty cool.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
If I were to say here is the subpage and submit this, it works.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
If I were to go back to newpage, that works as well. Pretty cool.
