00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.020
So from algorithm description, we go to implementation

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.540
now. This is where rubber meets the road

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.500
in systems reset. In any good systems reset,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.760
the prescription is as follows. You identify a

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.250
pain point. Once you identify the pain point. You think of what may be a clever

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.650
solution to that. Then a lot of heavy

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.290
lifting actually happens in taking that solution, which may

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.390
be a very simple solution, but implementing that is the hard part. if you take

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.290
this particular lesson that we're looking at The

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.810
solution idea is fairly simple. The idea is

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.800
that instead of using the disk as a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.240
paging device, use the cluster memory. But implementing

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.000
that idea requires quite a bit of heavy

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.560
lifting, and one might say that in systems

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.860
research these technical details Of taking an

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.980
idea and working out the technical details

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.260
of implementing that idea is probably the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.910
most important nugget. Even if the idea

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.430
itself is not enduring, the implementation tricks

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.420
and techniques that are invented in order

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.160
to do their implementation of their idea

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.080
maybe reusable knowledge for other systems research.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.034
So that's a key takeaway in any systems research and this true for this one as

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:23.670
well. Now in this particular case, the authors

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.490
of GSM used a deck, little equipment corporations operating

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.336
system as the base system. The operating system

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:34.560
is called OS of 1 operating system. And

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.460
there are two key components. In the OSF1

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.750
memory system, which is what we're talking about here.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.830
The first one is the virtual memory system,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.760
and this is the one that is responsible

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.300
for mapping process virtual address space to physical

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.550
memory, and worrying about page faults that happen when

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.480
a process is trying to access the stack and heap and so on. So that it can

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.140
bring those missing pages perhaps from the disk.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.900
And these pages are sometimes referred to as anonymous

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.500
pages because a page is housed in a physical page frame and when a page is

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400
replaced, that same physical page frame may host

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.270
some other virtual page and so on. So

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.490
the virtual memory system is devoted to managing

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.380
the page faults that occur for process virtual

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.510
address space, in particular the stack and the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.030
heap. And the unified buffer cache is the cache

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.460
that is used by the file system. And remember

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.410
the file system is also getting stuff from the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.550
disk. But the other system wants to cache it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.460
in physical memories so that it is faster, so the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.360
unified buffer cash is serving as the extraction for

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.670
the disk resident files when it gets into physical

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.170
memory and user processes. Are going to do explicit

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.660
access to files. When they do that, they're actually accessing

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.200
unified buffer cache. So reads and writes of files

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.570
go to this unified buffer cache. In addition to

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.430
that, Unix systems offer the ability to map a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.640
file. Into memory, which is called memory mapped files.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.590
And if you have a memory mapped file, you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.220
can also have page faults to a file that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.770
has been mapped into memory. So the unified buffer

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.160
cache is responsible for handling page faults to map files,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.190
as well as explicit read and write calls.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.100
That an application process may make to the file

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.500
system. So normally this is the picture of how

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.740
the memory system hangs together in any typical implementation

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.190
of an operating system. You have the virtual memory

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.140
manager, you have the unified buffer cache, you have

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.900
the disk, and region writes from the virtual memory

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.189
manager go to the disk, and similarly reads and

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.640
writes from the unified buffer cache, go to the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.500
disk and when a physical page frame is freed, you

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.410
through it into the free list. So that it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.030
is available for future use by either the virtual memory

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.100
manager or the unified buffer cache. And the Pageout

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.250
Daemon, it's role is to look at every once in

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.620
a while what are pages that can be swapped out

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.560
to the disk so that you make room for page

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.370
faults to be handled without necessarily running an

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.459
algorithm to free up pages. so that's the structure

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.089
of a memory management system, and what the

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.240
authors of GMS did, was to integrate GMS into

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.970
the operating system, and this is where I

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.300
said that. There is heavy lifting to be done,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.060
because you are modifying the operating system to integrate

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.710
an idea that you had for global memory system.
