00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, we're going to change this to breadth first search, but we're going to do it really easily,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
at least for the people version, by grabbing the first element off the open list

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
instead of the last element off the open list.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's take a look at how that changes things.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We start off with d as the first thing added to the list and d on the open list, and now

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
what we do is, well the first and the last element are the same, so nothing changed yet.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We grab d off, we mark any unmarked neighbors of that node of d,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which in this case are e and c just as before and that's done for this time through.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And now, we go back up to the top and things get a little different.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This time, well, actually not that different, the order was sort of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
arbitrary and so first and last are sort of arbitrary.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We're going to grab the first thing off the list just like the instruction say and that's e,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
add its neighbors in, they still get added to the end of the list, so that's a little different in terms

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of the numbering so far, but now it's where we go back up to the top and we grab the first

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
element of the list in which this case is c, so we're alternating.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Instead of continuing in one direction, we're actually expanding outward from d,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
with the d and then c and e, and then b and f.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And now, what happens next if we expand from f with expanded g, add it to the open list,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but now, before we touch g, we're always pulling off the front of the list now, we get to b.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Right now, we've visited everything.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The next thing we pull off is g, we notice that it has no open neighbors, then we pull off a,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
we notice that it has no open neighbors, and the open list is empty, the search is finish.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You can see what happens in this case is we expanded out from d and now a and g,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
well the sum of the a and g are 13 instead of 12, which is not a really significant or

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
meaningful difference at this point but it is indicating that the search is proceeding differently

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and the way it's proceeding importantly is out from the center.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
All the paths that it found, all the edges that it expanded

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
in new shortest distances it was away from the beginning state.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So, this is going to give us what we need to actually find shortest paths.
