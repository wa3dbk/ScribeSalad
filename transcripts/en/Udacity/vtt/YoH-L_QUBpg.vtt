00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now one thing I noticed as I was writing all those test patterns is that functions like

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
seq and alt are binary, which means if I want a sequence of 4 patterns,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I have to have a sequence of (a, followed by the sequence of (b, followed by sequence of (c,d),

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then I have to count the number of parens and get them right.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It seems like it'd be much easier if I could just write sequence of (a, b, c, d).

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we talked before about this idea of refactoring, that is changing your code

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to come up with a better interface that makes the program easier to use,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and this looks like a good example.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This would be a really convenient thing to do.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Why did I write seq this way?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, it was really convenient to be able to define sequence of (x,y)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and only have to worry about exactly 2 cases.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If I had done it like this, and I had to define sequence of an arbitrary number

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of arguments, then the definition of sequence would have been more complex.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So it's understandable that I did this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I want to make a change, so let's draw a picture.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Imagine this is my whole program and then somewhere here

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is the sequence part of my program.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, of course, this has connections to other parts of the program.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Sequence is called by and calls other components,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and if we make a change to sequence,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
then we have to consider the effects of those changes everywhere else in which it's used.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
When we consider these changes, there are 2 factors we would like to break out.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
One is, is the change backward compatible?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That is, if I make some change to sequence,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
am I guaranteed that however it was used before,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that those uses are still good, and they don't have to be changed?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If so, then my change will be local to sequence, and I won't have to be able to go

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
all over the program changing it everywhere else.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So that's a good property to have.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So for example, in this case, if I change sequence so that it still accepted

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
2 arguments like it did before, but it also accepts more than 2,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
than that would be a backwards compatible change as long as I didn't break anything else.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then the second factor is whether the change is internal or external.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So am I changing something on the inside of sequence that doesn't effect all the callers,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
than that's okay. In general, that's going to be backwards compatible.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Or am I changing something on the outside--changing the interface to the rest of the world?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In this case, going from the binary version to this n_ary version,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I can make it backwards compatible if I'm careful.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's definitely going to be both an internal and external change.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So I'm going to have to do something to the internal part of sequence.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And then I'm also changing the signature of the function, so I'm effecting the outside as well.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I can make that effect in a backwards compatible way.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Thinking about those 2 factors, what would be the better way to implement this call?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Let's say we're dealing with the match-set version where we're returning a tuple,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
would it be better to return the tuple sequence (a, b, c, d)

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
or the tuple sequence of (a, sequence of (b, sequence of (c, d)?

00:03:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Tell me which of these do you prefer from these criteria.
