00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.660
The solution for this is that when we commit the ROB2 instruction we're going to

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.380
take the value of 8 and put it in R1. So the correct answer here is R1 and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.560
the value is 8. And then we're going to check whether R1 mapping maps to ROB2.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.010
It doesn't. It still points to ROB6. So we just freed this reservation station.
