As I said earlier the Gang of Four book was immensely popular and

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.860
has spawned a whole, a whole movement within the software development community.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.360
However, patterns are not without problems and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.660
I want to look a few of them here. These come from Czenecki and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.601
Eisenhecker book which is listed on my class resources page. First off,

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.906
patterns are primarily implemented using, using two standard

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:26.437
object-oriented compo, compo, composition mechanisms, inherit inheritance and

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:30.960
object composition. But using patterns can add complexity. Often,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.760
there's the introduction of extra objects and extra levels of indirection. So

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.139
your code becomes more complicated even though you're using standard techniques.
