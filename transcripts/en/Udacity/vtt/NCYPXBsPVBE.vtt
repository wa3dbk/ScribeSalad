So, the fifth and final personality dimension we nave is neuroticism. And

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:09.401
neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions easily. Like fear,

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:14.930
anxiety, sadness and depression. And it's also the tendency to be high strung

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.824
under pressure. On the other hand, low neuroticism involves being cool, calm,

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:24.369
and collected, especially under pressure. Now, let me be clear. Neuroticism is

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.645
not the same thing as neurotic. In fact, it's only the top one or 2% of the

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:33.300
people in neuroticism who might be diagnosed as being neurotic.
