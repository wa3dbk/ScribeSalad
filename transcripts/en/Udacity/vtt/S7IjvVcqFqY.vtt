00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.775
Want to do what's called a dual stack deployment. In a dual stack deployment a

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:07.955
host can speak both IPv4 and IPv6. It

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:11.665
communicates with an IPv4 host using IPv4 and

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:15.530
communicates with an IPv6 host using IPv6.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.550
What this means is that the dual stack

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.610
host has to have an IPv4 compatible address.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.180
Either the host has both an IPv4 and

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.330
an IPv6 address, thus allowing it to speak to an IPv4 host or it must rely

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.390
on a translator, which knows how to take a v4 compatible IPv6 address,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.060
and translate it, to the v4 address. One possible way of ensuring compatibility,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.400
of a v6 address with IPv4, is simply to embed the IPv4 address, in 32 bits of

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.290
the 128 that are allocated for the IPv6 address. Now, a dual stack post

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.610
configuration or a v4 compatible IPv6 address solves the problem of post

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.910
IP address assignment, but it doesn't

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.790
solve the problem that IPv6 deployments might

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.670
exist as islands. For example, multiple

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.582
independent portions of the Internet might deploy

00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:21.990
IPv6, but what if the middle of the network only speaks in routes IPv4? The

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.530
solution here is to use what's called 6 to 4 tunneling. In 6 to 4 tunneling,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.470
a v6 packet is encapsulated in a v4 packet. Now, that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.570
v4 packet Is routed to a particular v4 to v6 gateway

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.580
corresponding to the v6 address that lies behind that gateway.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.190
And at this point the outer layer of

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.760
encapsulation can be stripped, and the v6 packet

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.990
can be sent to its destination. This of

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.970
course, requires the gateways at the boundaries between

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
the v4 and v6 networks to perform encapsulation

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.060
of the packet as it enters the v4

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.760
only part of the network, and decapsulation as

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.880
the packet enters the v6 island, where the destination

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.850
host resides.
