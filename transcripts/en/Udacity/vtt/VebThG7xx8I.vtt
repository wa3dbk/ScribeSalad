00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.070
So now that we know a little bit about class

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.050
variables, let's move on to another idea in object oriented

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.870
programming, which is that in Python, all classes come with

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.920
some pre-existing class variables. One of them is called doc. Now

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.880
this variable has got underscores on both sides of its

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.130
name. Let's see this variable in action. So here I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.450
am at the Python Shell window, with the Python prompt.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.250
And I can type a program in here like 2+2 and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.940
it gives me the correct answer. Now I want

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.780
us to recall this class called turtle that we had

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.480
used some time back while drawing shapes. So I

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.740
can just import that class turtle here. There, then let

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.500
me see what happens when I use the class

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.130
name. turtle.Turtle. Remember this was the name of the module

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.650
or the file and this was the class name.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.960
So if I use the class name with the prepackaged

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.430
variable called doc. Let me see what it prints out.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.330
I get some documentation on the class turtle.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.140
Now I wonder if I can use this variable doc

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.010
with my class movie. So, I'm back to the code

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.760
for the class movie and behind this file is my

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.320
other Python file where, I'm defining a whole bunch of

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.750
instances of class Movie. Let me go back to the

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.150
code for class Movie here for a second. Now, here,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.090
I'm going to add some documentation, at the beginning of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.720
the class Movie. You may have noticed that I use

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.290
triple quotes, to define my documentation. Now what I can

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.030
do with triple quotes, is I can create documentation in

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.940
multiple lines. For now I just have the one line.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.100
So I'm going to save this file, and then go

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.410
to my other Python file. And here, I'm going to

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.510
scroll all the way to the bottom, and comment out any

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.880
sort of print statements. There. Now, I will try to print out my class Movie,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.080
which is accessed by saying, media.Movie. I

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.112
will try to print out its documentation [SOUND].

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.900
There. Let me save and run this file.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.240
And there it is. The documentation for my

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.030
class Movie. Notice how I accessed it though. I

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.949
accessed it using my class name, which is movie

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.860
and a predefined class variable, called doc. So, now

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.860
that we have successfully used this variable called doc.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.140
I have a question for you. You know much

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.220
like the variable doc, Python has a few more

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.280
predefined variables these include the variable name and module.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.470
By the way more information about these

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.470
is also available through links in the instructor

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.320
notes. What I want you to do is

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.050
read through the documentation in the instructor notes

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.840
and then I want you to use these variables name and module, in a new

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.170
program. Once you have done that, please come

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.160
back to the screen and check this box.
