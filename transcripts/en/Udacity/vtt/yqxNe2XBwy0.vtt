00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.270
Your task in this exercise is to set the pivot point for the body and head to

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.741
be around the crossbar. Think back to the unit on transforms. We saw how the

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:12.258
snowman's arms could go to the wrong place with a bad order of transforms. If

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.714
we translate it then rotate it, the arms would swing wildly in their position

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:21.134
similar to the drinking bird; however, it's a bit trickier than that. The birds

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:24.530
body and head are in the correct spots, so where would be translate them to.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.474
Think about it this way, say we constructed the bird a bit differently. Instead

00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:31.078
of moving the body and head to their final location, what if we moved them so

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:35.144
that the center of the cross bar were was at the origin. Then, the body and the

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:39.436
hat would be right location for rotating around the crossbar. We could then put

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:42.327
both parts into an object 3D, such as the body head object, and apply the

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:46.963
rotation to this parent. We could then move the parent to the proper location

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:50.512
after performing the rotation. Your job is to modify the create drinking bird

00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:54.480
method so that the pivot is set correctly. I've given you a variable pivot

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.921
height which is the height of the cross bar above the origin. I'll also give

00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:02.734
you a hint. It should take about 3 lines of code inside just this method to set

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.099
the pivot.
