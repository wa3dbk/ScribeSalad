00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Quoted strings, that is, strings that are surrounded by double quotes, or the like,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
are a tricky issue that comes up in both JavaScript and HTML.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's bring all of our regular expression power to bear to see about separating

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
quoted strings from other words.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here I've drawn an evil quoted string that contains a bunch of double quotes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We really want to get to just the heart of it, just the contents and peel off

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
these 2 double quotes at the end.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There like the rind. I want to get to the core.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
However, if I just repeatedly use string.find to look for double quotes,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll find this one, but also this one in the middle.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This one in the middle, and this one in the end.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So I might mistakenly think that it's 2 quoted strings--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I said, and nothing over here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Oh no! Find isn't good enough!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In a shocking twist, we'll have to use regular expressions instead.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But first, to make our job a little easier, let me introduce to you some new regular expressions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The first is the dot, or period, which matches any character except a new line,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
or what you get when you press enter or return.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
For example, here I'm looking for any decimal digit [0 - 9] and then any character--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
anything except a line break--and then another [0 - 9].

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So for example, this is a decimal digit. This is another decimal digit.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And the "a" between them is any character.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This 2 is a decimal digit. The 2 between them is any character. This 2 is another decimal digit.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This "cc3" doesn't qualify because this "c" is not in [0 - 9].

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And one more--sometimes it's nice to be able to say anything except a digit

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
or anything except a number or anything except p.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Here we're looking for [0 - 9], followed by anything that's not "a" and also not "b".

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So here--oh! That immediately didn't work because the next thing was an "a",

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and we're asking for not "a".

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Right over here we've got a 1 and a space, and space isn't "a" or "b", so that looks good.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then here we've got a 2 and a 2, and this second 2 is not "a" or "b", so that looks good.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Here we've got a 2 and a space, and this space is not "a" or "b", so that looks good.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
"C" is not [0 - 9]. "C" is not [0 - 9], 3 is [0 - 9], but then we're at the end of the string.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.092
So that's it.
