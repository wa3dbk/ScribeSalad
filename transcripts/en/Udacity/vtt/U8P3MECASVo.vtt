00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.380
So now let me bring up the whole
famous approach of using SIFT for

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.290
doing feature detection,
scaling the features, by David Lowe.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.060
Reference is also there if
you want to look it up.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.510
It's also on the website.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.980
Basically what we're interested
in is finding the local maximum,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.190
both in scale and in space.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.390
Basically the measurements we want
to do is difference of Gaussians.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.952
I already showed you before.

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:27.251
And difference of Gaussians basically
creates a pyramid of the difference of

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:28.632
Gaussians within each object.

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:31.390
So it captures the scale.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.260
By looking at the derivative information
of the difference in variation of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.920
Gaussians across scale and also space.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.780
So here, basically coming up again
we have space, x y, scale going up.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.510
We basically again do the same
processing, but again for each and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.050
every aspect of it we're going to be
now doing difference of Gaussians.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.250
So in this case the difference of
Gaussians in x and y for each and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.020
every image, but also doing the same for
difference of Gaussians in scale.
