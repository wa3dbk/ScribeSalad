So far all of the types of used are built into Python. If we wanted to find new

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:08.420
ways of working with data and they'll find new operations, we need to define our

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.416
own types. That's what we'll learn next and the way to define your own type in

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:16.120
Python is to make a class. let's recap what we were doing with our web search

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.172
engine. We have the crawler module and the crawl.web procedures that would

00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:22.227
output two objects, that record that everything that we've learned from a web

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:26.640
crawl. The first is the index, that's the mapping between keywords and the list

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.950
of URLs that appear and we use dict, object to record that. And the second was

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.962
the dictionary object that maps URLs to ranks. This is what we used to record

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:38.732
the pageranks and then we need to keep track of both of those objects, pass them

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:42.606
into lucky-search in the right way to get the right output. What we'd like to do

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:46.282
by defining our own type is to encapsulate all this into one object. So, one of

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:50.522
the key things that defining our own types gives us it's called encapsulation.

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:55.416
And encapsulation means we can group many things into one object, provide a nice

00:00:55.416 --> 00:00:59.942
clean interface, so the only thing the crawler needs to produce is this one

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:03.565
object. And that's the only thing search needs to work on. And so, our goal is

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:08.290
to create a new module, and by using encapsulation instead of having to deal

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.381
with all that complexity. We'll have one output which is a WebCorpus output and

00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:17.762
that's what's used in search. And, by using Abstraction, we'll hide all the

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:22.128
details of how the internals of the WebCorpus are represented. All search needs

00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:25.023
to understand is how to use it to respond to queries.
