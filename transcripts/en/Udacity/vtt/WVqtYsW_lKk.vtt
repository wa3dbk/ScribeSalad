visual person. And frankly, so am I. So, we can help Grant make a decision about

which of these three brands of cleaning solution would be best to go with, let's

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.990
make some xy tables. I've given you values of x already, for each of the tables.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:20.070
And I'd just like you to fill in the corresponding values of y, according to the

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:21.380
equation above each table.
