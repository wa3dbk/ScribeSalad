00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.347
Now you've done a lot of work with numbers and most people think that numbers

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:07.570
are what computers are really good at. But truth be told many programmers work

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.880
more with text than numbers. In Java the technical term for text is a string.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.854
Why a string? You can think of text being a sequence of individual letters that

00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:24.932
are strung together. You have already seen strings. In Java, their enclosed in

00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:30.020
quotes and there's some text inside. You've seen string variables, here is one,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.728
it's called name and it's type is string. You've seen a bunch of string methods

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:39.752
and here are a few more. In the interest of learn by doing, go ahead, fire up

00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:45.249
BlueJ. And tell me what happens when you call each of these methods, or in the

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.500
last case, when you execute this piece of code.
