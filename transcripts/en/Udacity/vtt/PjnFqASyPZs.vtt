00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.820
So let's learn about classification.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.010
Here is the plan.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.119
I'm going to tell you just enough, so
that you can put together a very simple,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.230
but very important type of classifier,
called the logistic classifier.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.850
With that, you'll be able to run through
the first assignment which will have you

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.260
download and pre-process some images for
classification.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.630
And then run an actual logistic
classifier on that data.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.190
Once you've connected the bit of math
that's coming up and the code in

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.950
that first assignment, everything else
will just be building up from there.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.220
We will be building together all of
the pruning on top of this piece,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.820
block by block.
