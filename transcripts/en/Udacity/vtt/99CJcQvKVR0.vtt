00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.340
Let's talk a bit more
about Setting Good KPIs.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.200
A Key Performance Indicator or KPI is
a measurable value that demonstrates

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.460
how effectively a company is achieving
their key business objectives.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.230
Organizations use KPIs to evaluate
their success at reaching targets.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.370
As opposed to metrics,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.580
which simply demonstrate the current
state of events of a company.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.280
How much money they're making,
how many customers that they have.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.190
KPIs clearly indicate where actions for
change should be taken.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.940
For example,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.555
you could set KPIs to measure
increases in customer satisfaction.

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:43.805
You could also look at app installations
per whatever days, ten, 15, 30, 100.

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:49.102
You can also look at the number
of active users after 30 days.

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:53.492
The important aspect when selecting KPIs
is to ensure that they're tied to your

00:00:53.492 --> 00:00:55.232
own business objectives.

00:00:55.232 --> 00:00:58.092
It's a good idea to be agile here and

00:00:58.092 --> 00:01:01.242
to customize your KPIs as you
progress with your startup.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.680
So take a minute and think about some
of the KPIs that you might set for

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.240
your product.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340
And then,
how might you evaluate whether or

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.420
not the KPIs that you've
selected are the right ones?
