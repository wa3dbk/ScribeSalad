00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.730
We have to go back,
Marty, back to the past.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.950
I mean one that persists.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; Hold it.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.210
Let's pause for a second and
talk about what persistence and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.865
persisting data actually means.

00:00:09.865 --> 00:00:13.214
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Persistence is saving data to a place

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:14.754
where it can be re-accessed and

00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:17.740
retrieved upon restart of the device or
app.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.750
This can mean nonvolatile memory on your
device or saving data to remote servers.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.350
Persistence is necessary for any app
that wants to store data long term.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.130
That is longer than a life
cycle that running app and

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.350
keep it available to the user.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.690
In this course we Fernando, me and
you will go over how persistence works,

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.140
why it's needed,
what options are available for

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.200
creating persistent iOS apps and
what the most important ones are.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.320
We'll also add simple persistence
to a recording app, and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.230
work in a completely new app to
level up our persistence skills.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.850
You'll see a lot of Eden at the start
and more of me Fernando later on.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.070
As course developers here at Udacity
we are here to guide you through

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.420
the learning process of
iOS app persistence.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.130
We'll start with NS user defaults.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.710
One of the available options for
persistence.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.100
Then in lesson two we'll discuss
the iOS file system and sandboxing.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.530
In lesson three, we'll move on to our
second and most important option for

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.840
persistence, core data.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.810
Where we'll talk about pieces
of the core data stack,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.180
how to create a data model and how to
make objects from that data model.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.820
Lesson four will finish implementing
core data, and see how it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.770
actually persists our changes, will see
what happens behind the scenes, and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.365
most importantly, what core data
provides beyond persistence.

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:37.620
We'll also learn how to display
core data objects in tables, and

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.000
collection views.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.440
And in lesson five will dive deeper,
and find out how to search and

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.680
filter objects.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.380
And how to migrate our data model,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.180
which is vital to know before
uploading an app to the App Store.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.940
So let's get started by finding out
how the Doc plans to save Marty's

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.970
algorithm by using NS user defaults.
