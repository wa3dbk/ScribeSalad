00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.000
Mora just described the investigation where she estimated people's audience

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500
size. I want you to think about a time when you

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.390
posted a specific message or shared a photo on Facebook. What

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.360
was that message, and how many of your friends do you

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.020
think actually saw that exact post? And finally, what percent of

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.930
your friends do you think saw the post? The results of

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.470
Mora's investigation we reveal a little bit later in the course.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.550
But just so you know, there's no right or wrong answers

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.370
for these. Keep your guesses in mind, and then you can

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.580
compare them to the results that Mora found in her study. Write

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.790
about your message or your post here and then enter two numbers

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.140
here and here. And there's no need to include a percent sign.
