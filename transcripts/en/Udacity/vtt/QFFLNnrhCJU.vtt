Okay. Now for the answer. When does Eiffel check its invariants.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, it does precisely so as we defined before and as we recommended to check the invariants

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that is at the beginning of each public method and at the end of each public method.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you look at whenever some attribute is read or written, this also happens

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
within the methods of the class and in particular--say you first try to some attribute,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
then some other attribute, then some other attribute.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In between, you may have some inconsistency that will be discovered by the invariant.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So while some method of the class is operating including reading and writing attributes,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we don't want to check the invariant which is why these two must not be checked.
