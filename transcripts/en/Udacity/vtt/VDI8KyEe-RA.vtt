00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.710
So once we have determined the class to use and the type of constraint,

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.210
we can actually express the constraint in OCL and here's what it slooks,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.380
looks like. What I've put in bold are key words that belong to the language and

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.120
the parts in plain text, not bolded text correspond to the particular.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.580
Particulars of the UML diagram so we have the context is book.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.940
We have the keyword invariant and then we have a conditional expression.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.230
Recall from the statement of the requirement that there were two situations, one

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.810
for books in general and the other is for bestsellers. So it makes sense that we

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.130
have some kind of conditional going on there. This is a conditional expression.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.000
It's not a statement in the sense of a, a programming language.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.640
That is it produces a value rather than a change of state.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.700
Okay? And so if we read through it says, if bestseller and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.000
recall that bestseller was a bullion. Then it is the case that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.120
the check out period, which is an attribute of book, is two weeks. And

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.320
otherwise, the check out period is three weeks. So, one of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.710
two possibilities exist, and it depends upon the value of that, that boolean.
