00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.760
The final thing you'll want to do to
secure the authentication process

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.520
is to disable the password base logins.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.800
This will force all of your users to
only be able to login using a key pair.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.450
To do this, you'll have to edit
the configuration file for SSHD.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.340
Which is the service that's running
on the server listening for

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.290
all of your SSH connections.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.250
This configuration file is
located at etc/ssh/sshd_config.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.770
And you can edit it using sudo nano.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.300
There are a lot of options in here, and
you can read through them all to get

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.470
a better understanding of
how SSH is configured.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.300
The comment lines start
with the hash symbol here.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.690
And they're pretty good at
explaining what everything does.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.000
The line we're looking for is right
here, PasswordAuthentication yes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.978
We just want to change that to no,
and then we'll save the file.

00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:53.559
Now, the SSHD service is
currently running, and

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.540
it only reads its configuration file
when it's initially started up.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.580
So we need to restart the service so

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.880
it runs with the new configuration
option we just made.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.390
We restart the service by
sudo service ssh restart and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.750
that's all there is to it.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.040
Now all users will be forced
to log in using a key pair.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.110
SSH will not allow users to log in with
a user name and password any longer.
