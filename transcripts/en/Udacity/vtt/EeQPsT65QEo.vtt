00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
So, as always, when I introduce a new concept to you, we'll have a little quiz about this here.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.480
Now, it's always a bit difficult to ask, does P go into an infinite loop

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.400
when given I, so we'll slightly change that to the opposite question here,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.160
and ask, does the program stop when given I?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.250
So it's basically the other way around, and also it's the more

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.130
conventional definition of the halting problem, because

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
it's called the halting problem and not the infinite loop problem, to just ask 'does the program stop?'

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.960
Basically it's really just the opposite of an infinite loop.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.160
So if a program stops, it does not go into an infinite loop,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.390
and if it does not stop, it must be in some infinite loop.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.660
But let's do the quiz now. So I have here 3 programs.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.290
This is program 1, this is program 2, and program 3.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.650
And, of course, I have inputs for those programs, and what I would like you to tell me

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.090
for each combination of a program and an input,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.720
does the program stop when given this input?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.730
It stops, then you can check here, if it does not stop, so if it goes into an infinite loop,

00:00:54.730 --> 99:59:59.000
then I would like you to check here.
