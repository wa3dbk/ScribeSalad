00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.009
Let's go back to adding things to our chart.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.059
Remember from the intro video that this course is going to

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.330
involve a version control system called Git?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.200
You may be wondering how Git got its name.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.540
It was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.288
Git is British slang for something roughly equivalent to unpleasant person.

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:17.720
Torvalds once said, I'm an egotistical bastard and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.310
I name all my projects after myself.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.070
First Linux, now Git.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.090
Git was designed with code in mind.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.088
It's not the only system built with that goal though.

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:27.870
One early widely-adopted version control system for

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.180
code is called CVS, Concurrent Version Systems.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.727
Another system, SVN, also known as Subversion, is fairly similar, but

00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:38.060
improved on CVS to some extent.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.640
Another system you may have heard of is Mercurial, abbreviated hg,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.120
the elemental symbol for mercury.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.300
Mercurial has a lot in common with Git, and CVS and SVN are pretty similar.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.820
So to avoid cluttering up our chart, I'll just add SVN and leave the others off.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.520
Let's go ahead and fill in the chart for our new entries.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.120
All right, so

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.220
which of these systems have the user manually saving versus autosaving?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.300
Well, clearly manual saving requires you to manually save.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
Wikipedia also requires this, so does SVN.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.470
Dropbox and Google Docs, on the other hand, save versions for you whether or

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.090
not you manually save.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.210
So what does Git do?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.580
Git takes the manual approach,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.790
allowing the user to choose when to create checkpoints.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.810
While it may seem like having changes saved automatically would be convenient or

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.640
nice, Git's system makes it much more likely that each individual version

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.310
represent a logical change.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.940
We'll expand on why this is useful later.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.770
But intuitively, being able to view old versions is much more useful if each

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.130
checkpoint is meaningful.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.770
In Git terminology, these user-created checkpoints are called commits.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.740
Commits are the basic building blocks of Git,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.140
each one representing a version of the content at one point in time.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.870
Git requires the user to supply commit message each time a commit is created.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.810
This makes looking through old versions much more useful and pleasant than

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.700
the Google Docs model, assuming that the user supplied a useful commit message.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.550
You'll actually get a chance to

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.820
see what this looks like in Git soon with Caroline.
