00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.800
So, before we talk about this
different kind of models, and

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.040
we will talk about a number of them,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.680
let's sort of explore what is new thing
that we need for implementing them.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.010
So, we're obviously, I said, going
beyond discretionary access control.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.778
Well, implementation of this mandatory
access control model is going to require

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:22.360
some new functionality,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.030
some new mechanisms the system
has to now include.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.290
So one of the new things that we're
going to talk about all the time is,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.280
what is called sort of these labels
that we're going to associate.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.550
That's a key new
implementation requirement for

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.310
defining these models and for
implementing these models.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.270
But idea is that we're going to see
that both users and resources of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.680
documents are going to have certain
labels attached or associated with them.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.880
And they're going to get used in the way
we make access control decisions.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.000
So what's the purpose of a label that
you want to attach to a document or

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.290
associate with a user?

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.310
The label is actually going
to tell us how sensitive

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.900
certain information may be.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.090
Labels also actually have something
that describes the nature of the data.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.530
What topic,
what area does the data come from?

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.010
We talked on payroll as another example,
before.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.970
So labels could also include
sort of a category of

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.040
the nature of the data
that we have here.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.680
And that's sort of useful in answering
this question, who needs to know or

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.930
needs to have accessed?

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.430
If you're in the payroll department,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.020
of course you need access
to payroll information.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.616
Labels with documents,
or data files, or users,

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:40.110
are going to capture something
about the information that's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.050
contained in those documents and
the users who need to access them.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.660
So these labels are actually going to
get manipulated each time access to

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.370
an object or document is requested.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.560
So TCB is actually not going to
associate, but it's going to use these

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.200
labels associated with user and
the object any time the request is made.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.430
So when I say the labels look right,
of course we have to sort of say,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.940
here's the label for the user, and
here's the label for the document.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.250
Should the user be able to access
this document, to be able to read it?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.980
So we have to sort of relate or
compare the labels,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.750
and we're going to see
results of that comparison.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.990
But you're going to say,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.300
here is user with this label, here
is a document with this other label.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.790
Does the user's level imply that
he can access this document?

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.120
So we have to relate, compare,
the labels that we have.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.620
Now exact nature of what the labels look
like, and how we are going to be able to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.515
compare them, and what the result
of the comparison is, well, that's

00:02:40.515 --> 00:02:44.620
going to depend on the particular model
or policy that we're going to implement.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.460
We're going to look at several different
examples, and each one of them has

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.110
a very different kind of a label,
and how you make use of that label.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.260
A label goes with, not just
the document, but also with a user.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.000
And we'll see examples of those.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.195
So in the Department of Defense,

00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:03.520
we're talking about the labels
actually going to include.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.080
For a user,
it'll be their clearance level.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.320
For a document, at what level
the document is classified.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.920
And compartment is this category
that we're talking about.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.350
What kind of information is
contained in this document?

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.220
Of course, in the commercial world,
we don't have clearances and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.230
classifications.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.440
So these labels have to look different.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.240
And the concerns are going to
be of a different kind, also.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.520
For example, we may have
conflict-of-interest concern.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.160
So access control must be such that when
somebody has a conflict, they don't get

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.720
to access a certain document where a
conflict-of-interest, or COI, may arise.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.090
Similarly, sometimes we may have
separation-of-duty requirements.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.270
The same person can do two different
things, when allowing them to do that

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.960
requires a level of trust or potential
for fraud and things like that.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.650
So, the needs would be different
in commercial versus DoD,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.800
or garment DoD intelligence agency.
