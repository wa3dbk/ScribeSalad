00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.055
In general, we like the ratio between texels and pixels to be around one to

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:07.092
one. If the texels cover too many pixels, we'll get blurring as we saw in the

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:11.504
previous lesson. This isn't so bad for real textures, so erring a bit on the

00:00:11.504 --> 00:00:15.486
side of smaller textures is not the worst crime that you can commit. If a pixel

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:21.050
covers too many texels, we get minification which leads to different problems.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.200
For a high resolution checker texture, it simply causes the edges to become

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.350
sharp. However, the problem is much worse than this under normal viewing

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.384
conditions. Changing the texture resolution does not help. When a pixel covers

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:35.802
more than one texel, minification occurs. This is what's happening in the

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:40.014
distance. There's a separate filter on the texture for this situation. The

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:43.158
reason it's separate is that this problem has a different solution. Currently,

00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:46.650
this minification filter is set to be nearest neighbor. As we saw for

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.806
magnification, this is usually a bad choice. Let's turn on bilinear

00:00:50.806 --> 00:00:54.334
interpolation for the minification filter, too. This helps a little bit towards

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:58.050
the middle of the image, but not much. The problem is that each pixel in the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.196
distance covers a few texels. As we get closer and closer to the horizon, the

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:06.018
number of texels per pixel increases. When the fragment shader looks up what's

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:08.791
in the texture, it gets whatever texel happens to be at the center of the

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:13.801
pixel. At the horizon, this selection is almost random, so we get noise as we

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:18.810
vary between white and black texels. Even with bilinear interpolation on, it's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.600
still just noise. With magnification we found that too many pixels covering one

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.848
texel caused blurring. Getting this ratio closer to one to one made things just

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:32.376
right. Here we have too many texels in one pixel. One solution is to go in the

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:36.136
opposite direction than we went for magnification. Instead of making our

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:39.191
checkerboard have a larger and larger resolution, we'd like it if the distant

00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:44.452
pixels used a lower resolution texture. This would bring the ratio of texels to

00:01:44.452 --> 00:01:48.894
pixels about back to one to one. I can show this by lowering the resolution of

00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:52.102
the texture. I'll say it again, the video may not show much difference as these

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:56.134
videos are heavily compressed so that they're quicker to download. Your best

00:01:56.134 --> 00:02:00.184
bet is to try this demo out for yourself. It follows this lesson. Anyway,

00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:02.788
changing the resolution helps a bit towards the middle of the image, since

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:06.815
these pixels have more and more texels as we move to the horizon. Blurriness is

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:10.253
much better than noisiness, especially when moving the view around. Things

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:13.390
still look terrible on the horizon because every pixel in that area covers so

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.624
many texels that even our two by two texel image fails. If we go to a one by

00:02:17.624 --> 00:02:22.394
one checkerboard pattern, that might help a bit. What in the world is a one by

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:26.020
one checker board? Well, its just a single checker square, a single texel.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.810
Since I can't put both black and white in this texel, I make this texel grey.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.093
Choosing this texture is like the nuclear option, the horizon looks better than

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:38.382
noise but now everything is grey. To sum up, at some point near the horizon,

00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:43.577
there are just too many texels to pixels. So to avoid noise we go to grey. Try

00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:47.294
the demo yourself at this point and see how changing the texel to pixel ratio

00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:49.330
affects the image.
