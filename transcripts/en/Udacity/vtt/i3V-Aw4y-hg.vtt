00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
Here's one way to define add page to index.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.040
We're defining a procedure that takes in 3 inputs--

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.010
the index, the URL and the content at that location--

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.810
We use the split method to divide the content into its component words.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.880
We store that into the words variable.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.220
Then what we want to do is go through all of the words, adding each word into the index.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.260
We can do that using a 4-loop.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.590
We're going through all of the words, we'll use word as our variable.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.230
For each word, we call add to index, pass in to index the word and the URL.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.200
Note that if a word occurs more than once on the same page,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.540
we're going to keep adding it to the index each time.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.180
There might be more than one occurrence of the same URL

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.180
in the list of URLs associated with a word.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.980
Depending on what we want our search engine to do,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.020
and how we are going to decide on how to respond to queries,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
this might be a good thing or a bad thing. We'll talk more about that in a later class.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.160
Let's try this in the Python interpreter.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.030
Let's recap the code we already wrote--

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.760
we have the add to index procedure--

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
that takes in the index, the keyword and the URL.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.830
It goes through the entries in the index,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.830
and it appends the URLs to the entries that matches the keyword.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.640
If it's not found, it adds a new entry to the index,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.110
that's the list of the keyword, and the single URL.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.010
We defined the lookup procedure that takes the index and the keyword,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.320
finds the entry in the index that corresponds to that keyword,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.990
and returns the URLs associated with that keyword.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.820
So, now we're going to define the add page to index procedure.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.860
So, here it is, we're splitting the content into it's component words,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.060
we're looping through the words, and we're adding each word to the index--

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.100
note that we don't need to return anything--

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.400
the point of this procedure is to modify the index.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.470
Let's try add page to index with a few simple examples.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.880
Here we have the test we tried before--

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.250
we see that we get the expected result--

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.220
if we're adding the first quote to the index, we see that there is the 4 words in the quote

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.290
each has the list of pages associated with it--the list of URLs contains fake.test.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.030
Then we added the 2nd page, the 2nd print we see,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.030
now for most of the words we have both fake.test and not.test except for not,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.030
which only has not.test.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.200
So, to be really convinced that this works, let's try a few more interesting examples.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.910
Now we're going to add page to index that might be on the dilbert.com page--

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.780
this quote from Scott Adams about time management--

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.240
"Another strategy is to ignore the fact that you're slowly killing yourself

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.050
by not sleeping and exercising enough

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.150
that frees up several hours a day, the only down side is that you get fat and die."

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.420
Hopefully that is not happening to anyone in this class.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.130
I know that it's a lot of work,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.760
but you need to manage your time so that you're still getting enough sleep and exercise.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.000
The second quote we'll add to the page index and we'll give the URL randy.pousch for that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.940
And it's a quote that says "Good judgement comes from experience,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.010
experience comes from bad judgement.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.610
If things aren't going well,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.180
it probably means you are learning a lot and things will go better later."

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.510
So, hopefully things are going well in this class,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.550
but if they're not, that means you're learning a lot and hopefully things will go better later.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.690
Let's see what the index looks like after adding these 2 pages.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.790
You see that it is pretty big, there are a lot of words in those 2 quotes.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.460
We can see that some of them only appear at dilbert.com

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.330
and from the quote from Scott Adams on time management--

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.970
others appear on both pages--

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.470
We'll see more if we try a query. Let's try a query.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.540
We'll look up in our index to see where the word you appears.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.310
And when we run that, we see it appears in both documents.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.980
It was there in the dilbert quote twice, it was listed 2 times at the URL dilbert.com

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.020
and once and the Randy Pousch URL.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.460
Just to confirm, the 2 occurrences in this quote, there is one here--and there's one here.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.630
And there's one in the second quote right here.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.570
If we look up another word, we see good did not occur in any of the quotes,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.610
but bad appeared in the 2nd one.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.810
So, it looks like all the code that we have seems to be working.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.350
We can look up words that are indexed and get the list of URLs where they were found.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.720
We can add pages to our index.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.750
And we can record all of the words in that page at the location they occur.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.220
We're really close to having a search engine.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.560
The one thing that we have left to do

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.029
is to connect the code we already wrote for crawling the web to

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.400
the code that we have for indexing documents and looking up the keywords.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.570
It's been awhile since we looked at the code for crawling the web.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.570
Let's look at that again and see if we can think how to connect the two.
