00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:02.414
In this homework assignment, we asked you to

00:00:02.414 --> 00:00:06.958
write a function called auto debug, which takes a

00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:12.319
test piece of code, a test list and a test interesting,

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.904
which checks if the code is interesting in some way.

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:18.548
What we really mean is if there is some kind

00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:21.435
of bug that we know is going to happen. So we

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:24.305
have this test specifically to check for it. In this

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:27.009
case, the test is interesting if it contains A plus B

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.701
on the same line, and variable A and variable B

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:33.597
before that line. So how do we go about doing this?

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:36.424
Well, we just – we first take the actual test

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:40.857
list and the interesting test itself and if test itself is

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:43.164
not interesting, then we return none. Because if

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:46.137
it’s not interesting, none of its subsets are going to

00:00:46.137 --> 00:00:48.980
be interesting either. Otherwise we continue on

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.919
and we set a size and a current test, best size and

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.560
best test to be the length of the current test and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.546
test itself. Because we know those are interesting

00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:00.761
since we didn’t return and we want to hopefully

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.561
find a smaller subset, so that we can narrow down

00:01:03.592 --> 00:01:08.306
where we are and where the bug we care about

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:12.219
actually is. So we run through all the subsets of

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.524
test and I will go through how we implemented

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:18.115
that in a second. And for every element smaller in

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:21.808
all the possible subsets of the test list, we check if

00:01:21.822 --> 00:01:25.489
first of all the length of the subset is less than the

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:29.094
current best size – the current size of the – of an

00:01:29.094 --> 00:01:32.815
interesting test list and that this element is also

00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:37.505
interesting. If it is, then we reset the new best test

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.969
to be this smaller subset and the current best size

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:45.086
to be equal to the length of this smaller subset.

00:01:45.086 --> 00:01:47.971
And we keep running through this until we find

00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:51.651
hopefully the smaller subset or a smallest subset.

00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:54.745
We might have two interesting subsets that are the

00:01:54.745 --> 00:01:57.858
same size, that’s possible. And then once we’re all

00:01:57.858 --> 00:02:00.559
done with checking through all possible subsets,

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:03.471
we just return the best test. Now to get all the

00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:07.070
subsets, which is something called a power set, if

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.652
you’re familiar with set theory, we run it through

00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:12.585
this other function called ‘all subsets’ that takes a

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:17.828
list, sets an element called ‘power set’ or ‘P set’

00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:21.316
that is a list containing just the empty list, because

00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:23.615
the empty list is always a subset of everything

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:26.088
because it’s nothing. And for every element in the

00:02:26.088 --> 00:02:30.291
list, we add two P set for all X that are currently

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:33.757
in P set, that plus the element we’re talking about.

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:36.769
And this is really something that you should

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.857
probably play with and see how it acts, to really

00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:43.809
buy that this does what it says it does. It’s a really

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.906
clever piece of code. And then we just return this.

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:51.241
And this is just all the possible subsets, including

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:55.065
the set itself. So what the all subsets method really

00:02:55.065 --> 00:03:00.069
does is it takes a list, let’s say list 1, 2, 3, and it

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.852
returns all of the subsets of that list. So you would

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.843
have the empty list and you would also have the

00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:11.850
subsets containing just one element and then all

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.750
the subsets containing two elements or sub lists –

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.961
I keep saying subsets; really these are lists and it’s

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:23.394
not strictly the same thing, but we can treat them

00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:26.509
like that for now. And then all the subsets

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.323
containing three elements, which is actually just

00:03:29.323 --> 00:03:32.811
the overarching list itself. And this is what the

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:36.308
function of all subsets returns. Now to test this,

00:03:36.308 --> 00:03:39.663
we have a few test cases down here, and we

00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:43.023
already had the interesting test that we talked

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:46.135
about earlier and we run test one through that and

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:50.100
test one is this fragment of code up here.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.124
So variable X, variable Y, variable Z. X equals Y

00:03:55.124 --> 00:04:00.249
plus Z. Y equals Z and Z equals X plus X. So we

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.160
run that through in – through auto debug and we

00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:06.365
should find that this is the smallest interesting

00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:09.642
fragment. And we see the first true statement,

00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:12.314
means that this is true. To find another interesting

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:16.084
test, for this one, it’s just a list is interesting if it

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:18.711
contains three numbers in strict sending order.

00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:21.348
And then we take some numbers here that we’ve

00:04:21.348 --> 00:04:24.553
generated somewhat randomly and we check auto

00:04:24.553 --> 00:04:27.825
debug against test two and interesting two.

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:30.969
And just by hand-checking this, you should see

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.856
that the length of the smallest interesting subset is

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:37.268
three, which we can see; when it ran it, we got

00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:41.806
true, and indeed, if we check if the answer from

00:04:41.806 --> 00:04:44.155
this is itself interesting – if we run it back

00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:46.979
through interesting, we see that it is true.

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.320
So our function for auto debugging or at least

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.068
some auto debugging works fairly nicely.
