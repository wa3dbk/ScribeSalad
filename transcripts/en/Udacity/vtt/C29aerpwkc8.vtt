Okay. So, I wrote a program called Take A Break that for now is

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.599
hidden behind this graphic. But, let me just focus on running it. When I do

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.619
that, the program starts to keep track of time and after every two hours

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.140
of work on the computer it opens a browser to play your friend's favorite song.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:28.258
[MUSIC]

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:30.938
After another two hours of work, it prompts you

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:34.250
to take another break and so on. Let's build this.
