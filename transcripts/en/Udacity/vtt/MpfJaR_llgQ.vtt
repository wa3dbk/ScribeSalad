00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And our second question comes from Hardy Martinez.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He wants to know if the rules and format for regular expression

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that we're learning now--if they extend to other languages beyond Python,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or if they are Python specific.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In general, they use almost all the same notation,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and that's partly because down underneath all the APIs that you see,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
all the functions that you are calling,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
they're using almost the same code.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's based on some--someone wrote it way back, and it seemed to work well,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so people reuse it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There are some differences, depending on

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the language you're using and the library you're using,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and that's just something you look up in the documentation.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Python, for example, has a lot of documentation on what the symbols mean and whatnot.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Sometimes they'll vary, especially when you're getting to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the more obscure syntax features of regular expressions,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which we don't cover in that class.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Pretty much everything we talk about here is going to be the same throughout.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Okay, so students that learn this will not be behind

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
when they try to implement regular expressions?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Yeah, and what matters is you know what the tools are.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The specific character that means something,

00:00:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
it doesn't make that much of a difference.
