00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.615
Natural selection has caused drastic physical changes in human evolution.

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:09.479
Including the ability to walk upright, the development of skin with far less

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:16.032
hair, and most importantly, the growth of a very large brain. Of course, the

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:22.044
evolution of a larger brain has many benefits. But it also has many costs. So,

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:25.524
here's a question, what are some of the physical costs of having a bigger

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:30.973
brain? The ability to store decades worth of information. The need for more

00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:36.190
food or energy. Childbirth becoming more painful because of bigger heads. Or,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.749
problem solving skills begin to develop. Go ahead and check any and all that

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.339
you think apply.
