To get 16, we need to square 4. So log base 4 of 4 to the 2 should be 2. 4 to

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.598
the 1 is equal to 4, so this should be 1. And the way we get 2 is by taking 4

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:16.797
to the one half power. That definitely is a little bit tricky. So this should

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:20.920
be one half. Remember, taking the square root of something is the same as

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.419
taking it to the one half power.
