00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.670
The results yield an expected value for

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.410
price given the characteristics of our diamond, and

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.986
the upper and lower bounds of a 95%

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:12.560
confidence level. Note, because this is a linear

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.680
model, predict is just multiplying each model coefficient

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.950
by each value in our data. It turns

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.980
out that this diamond is a touch pricier

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.390
than the expected value under the full model,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.998
though it is by no means outside of the 95% confidence interval.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:36.920
Blue now has by most accounts a better reputation than diamond SE.info

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.080
however. And reputation is worth a lot in a business that relies

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.470
on easy to forge certificates in which the non-expert can be easily fooled.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.650
So, while this model might give you a sense of whether your diamond is a ripoff

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.460
against diamondSE.info diamonds, it's not clear that diamondSE.info

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.940
should be regarded as the universal source of truth

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.710
over whether the price of a diamond is

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.508
reasonable. Nonetheless, to have the expected price and diamondassay.info

00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:10.150
with a 95% interval, is a lot more

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.740
information than we had about the price we should

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.453
be willing to pay for a diamond before we started this exercise.
