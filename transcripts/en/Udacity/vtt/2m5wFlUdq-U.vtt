00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.788
If you to take a box or a spherical clock hand from their previous exercisers

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:07.609
and position it and rotate it, you'll get it something like this. [unknown] is

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.806
doing the standard rotate then translate in a series of operations. The hands

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:15.625
are rotated to the proper angles but the translations don't move that much along

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:19.542
their axis but rather move them in world space. In this exercise, you are going

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:23.492
to make proper clock hands. The positions and scales in the exercise are all

00:00:23.492 --> 00:00:27.069
correct. You shouldn't need to change those. You need to figure out how to

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:32.080
rotate the hands so they are properly oriented. When you're done, you should see

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.303
the hands as shown here.
