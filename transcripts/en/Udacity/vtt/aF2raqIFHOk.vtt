00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.600
We need to be able to get a baseline to compare our caffeine group to. In an

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.890
experimental study, there are two types of groups. There's the experimental

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.490
group and there's the control group. The control group receives the same exact

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.220
treatment as the experimental group. The only difference is the independent

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.740
variable. So, in our case, our control group does not receive caffeine. Our

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.519
independent variable, but the experimental group does.
