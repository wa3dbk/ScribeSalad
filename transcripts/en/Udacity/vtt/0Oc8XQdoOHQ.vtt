00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.770
So how to be successful with SCO.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.640
The first thing that we need to remember
is first of all not to overdo it and

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.660
not to underestimate it.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.309
Back in the day you could make
a lot of money with SCO just by

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.440
exchanging links and optimizing for
specific keywords on your website.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.210
That was amazing.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.980
That was the gold rush of SCO.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.630
But that's not happening anymore.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.060
A lot of websites
are getting slapped and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.650
a lot of people who made a lot of money
are not making that money anymore.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.550
And they don't have
a choice because what

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.440
was working back then
is not working anymore.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.130
And the best thing that you
should remember with about SCO

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.520
is that it's the most the relevancy
of your offering to the audience.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.920
And when people
are using search engines,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.130
they are basically asking questions.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.196
So if you'll think about it,
if you're typing into the search engine,

00:00:58.196 --> 00:01:01.210
cheap clothes New York.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.450
We're basically asking a question,
right?

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.620
Where can I find cheap
clothes in New York?

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.540
Or what kind of cheap clothes
can I find in New York?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.540
And so on and so forth.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.260
So you want your website
to be ranked in the top.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.070
So you want to create some kind
of answers to those questions.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.980
So if we are thinking also about
what kind of content to create, so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.560
we need to entertain,
or we need to educate.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.260
We need also to answer questions.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.160
One of the most important things is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.230
how to know which keyword
we should invest on.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.340
There are so many keywords.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.310
People are arriving to our site using
50,000 different kinds of keywords.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.320
Some of them are even titles.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.550
So they were branded, that they were
using our name, some of them were not.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.740
How can we know what to use?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.870
So there's a lot of ways, similarly is
one of them that you can search for

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.500
the keywords that are leading
users to your competitors,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.680
the keywords that are leading users
to the websites on mobile apps that

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.430
you think are similar to yours.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.820
And you can start and
finding those keywords,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.258
creating the list, and then you know
what kind of content to create and

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:13.630
what kind of questions
you want to answer on.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.840
You want really to avoid nasty tricks,
black header CO.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.820
This can be very gratifying
in the beginning.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.150
You can get a lot of users, but
you'll eventually get slapped.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.300
It happened in the past,
it will happen in the future.
