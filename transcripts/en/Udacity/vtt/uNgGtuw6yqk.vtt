00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.162
Here are the midpoints that I found using our averaging method. So just like you

00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:08.089
saw in the previous quiz, all we need to do to find each midpoint is take the

00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:12.169
average of the x coordinates of the points that lies between, and then also, the

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:15.351
average of the y coordinates of the points that lies between.
