00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The main things we're going to learn in this class:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the first two units, we'll focus on symmetric cryptography and it's applications.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Symmetric cryptography means both parties have the same key.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So if we have two people: Alice and Bob--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in cryptography we almost always talk about Alice and Bob--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it's not clear why, but, they're useful people to talk about

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and they apparently have lots of secret messages to send between each other--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and they want to send messages.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
They want to know that they couldn't be intercepted

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
by some eavesdropper listening on the channel.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In symmetric cryptography we assume that they both start knowing the same key,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and they can use that same key for both encryption and decryption,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we'll see more of what that means soon in this unit.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What we'll do in units 3 and 4 is introduce asymmetric cryptography,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
as well as some applications,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and asymmetric cryptography is also known as public key cryptography.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And the key difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is that the keys used to encrypt and decrypt can be different.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, our message gets encrypted, it means there's some function that takes a message

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and a key produces some encrypted message--which we call ciphertext.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In symmetric cryptography, the decryption uses the same key.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In asymmetric cryptography, the decryption uses a different key,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and if the keys are different and unrelated, that means you can reveal one of the keys without revealing the other key,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and that's the power that asymmetric encryption gives us,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and we'll see lots of interesting ways to use that.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And in units 5 and 6, we'll look at protocols

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that use both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to solve interesting problems.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The reason most interesting protocols combine both of these

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is because asymmetric cryptography tends to be very expensive--

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you need big keys, you need lots of mathematics--

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to do asymmetric cryptography--lots of computation.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Whereas symmetric cryptography can be very efficient.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So that's why most interesting protocols--

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
like the one we saw for accessing a secure website--

00:02:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
involve both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
