00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's put our hard one knowledge of these new regular expressions

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
like any character except new line or set compliment of what we've been talking about

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to the test.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'd like you to submit via the interpreter, assign to the variable regexp,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a Python regular expression that matches double-quoted string literals

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and--this is the sticker--allows for escaped double quotes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let me just jump over to the interpreter briefly to show you what I'm talking about,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and then we'll come back here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It turns out that there is 1 of those gritty details in this problem that makes life fun,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but also complicated the first time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The sorts of strings that I want you to accept are like this one down here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
"You say, and then there's a \yes\, I say, no.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We've got \no\ and then it ends.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is a well-formed, well-balanced string literal with double quotes

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and some escaped double quotes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
However, to get it to Python, remember that Python is going to treat the escaped sequences,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
meaning no literally the next thing.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But what if you want to literally have a backslash?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Then you need to escape the escape sequence.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It is turtles all the way down, my friends.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So if you want to do some testing on your procedure,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
here this string 1, this is what you'd have to enter into Python

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in order to get it to be the sort of string we're looking for.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Here I started with single quotes, and then I've double escaped this backslash,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
then the double quotes, double escape again.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Here I've added 2 more, just to make this extra clear.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
All 3 of these are positive examples--whoops! I'm so wrong!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I have forgotten the closing double quote at the end of '"I say, \\"hello.\\"'.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is a negative example.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Let's go fix it. There we go. Add in another quote.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now all 3 of these are positive examples of the sorts of strings you'd want to match.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You say, yes. I say, no.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I do realize that there should be a quote here,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but I've intentionally left out the apostrophe in don't,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
so as not to confuse the issue since we're already talking about quoted strings.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So here just to remind you, I've written out a positive example and a negative example.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
On the left is what you'd have to say to Python and on the right is what it means.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And the big hints are that you'll probably want to escape the double quotes and the backslash,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
just like we did here.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You may want to consider having parenthesis nested inside other parenthesis.

00:02:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This one's tricky. Good luck!
