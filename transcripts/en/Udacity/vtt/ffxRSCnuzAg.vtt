00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.488
Here's one solution, it directly multiplies the diffuse component by the

00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:06.946
function. I highly recommend trying out any other functions you want right

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:10.125
here. The main thing is to aim for functions that give back numbers in the

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:14.205
range zero to one. The numbers can be outside this range, smoke won't come out

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:17.692
of your computer. All that happens is that the value gets clamped to zero or

00:00:17.692 --> 00:00:18.430
one.
