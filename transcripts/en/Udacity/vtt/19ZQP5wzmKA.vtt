00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.155
154 is one standard diviation below the mean. So we're trying to find out what

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:10.358
proportion of people are in this green region. Well, let's start with what we

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:15.518
know. We know that 34% is between one standard devaition below the mean and the

00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:21.116
mean. And 34% is between the mean and one standard deviation above the mean. The

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:27.610
mean because that makes 68% here. And we also know that 95% is between two

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.306
center deviations below the mean and two above the mean, 95 minus 68 is 27 so

00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:41.423
27% is distributed between this area and this area meaning that 13.5% is here.

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:47.377
And 13.5% is here, And you already found that, that leaves 5% to be distributed

00:00:47.377 --> 00:00:53.383
between the two tails, below two center deviations below the mean and above two

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:59.180
center deviations above the mean. So we know here, this is 2.5% and this is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.450
2.5%. Now, we pretty much have our answer. 13.5% plus 2.5% is 16%, so that's a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.400
proportion of 0.16.
