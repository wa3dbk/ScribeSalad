00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.129
All of these but one are correct. We saw in the problem we did for Grant that we

00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:08.092
have to change both sides of an equation in the same way to make sure that we

00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:12.378
maintain equality. So this last choice down here is correct. The answer we ended

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.233
up with also was a way of expressing an unknown quantity in terms of other

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:20.925
information that we had, which is this third choice. When we found that c equals

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:25.357
6.5, we could plug that number back into our original equation to make it a true

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.789
equation. So, this first answer works as well. We could not, however, change one

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:34.158
side of our equation. We could not, however, change one side of our equation in

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.087
a different way than the other side. And we also didn't have in mind, in

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:41.810
advance, what number we wanted the variable to equal. So, this answer right

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:44.860
here, the second one, is not something that we want to select.
