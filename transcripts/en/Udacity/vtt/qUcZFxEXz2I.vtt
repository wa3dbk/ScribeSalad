Well no. We have evidence to suggest that most dogs have four legs. Because in

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:09.572
our sample all of them had four legs. But we didn't prove that most dogs have

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:16.231
four legs. In this case we didn't prove the alternative hypothesis either. But

00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:20.530
based on our sample, we'll simple fail to reject the null.
