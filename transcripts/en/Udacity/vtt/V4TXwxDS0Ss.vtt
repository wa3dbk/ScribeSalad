00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The next kind of graph we're going to look at is called a hypercube,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and the graph is almost but not quite as cool as the name.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to define a hypercube for any number of nodes as long as

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that number of nodes is a power of 2.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Here we have four nodes. That's a power of 2--2Â˛.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
What we're going to do is we're going to connect edges up in a particular way.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is how we're going to do it. We're going to imagine that every node has a label.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That label is a bit pattern.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In particular, we're going to imagine that we're going to number each of the nodes,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
basically, from 0 up to n - 1.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're going to connect two nodes if their bit patters differ in exactly one place.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We see this example here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If we label the nodes--these are now binary numbers 0, 1, 2, 3--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we connect these two nodes because they differ just in the first bit--11, 01.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We connect these two because they differ in the second bit--10, 11.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We connect these two because they differ in the second place--00, 01.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And we connect these two because they differ in the first place--00, 10.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We can generalize this to larger graphs.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Here's a hypercube on eight nodes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We number the nodes from 0 to 7 in their binary bit patterns.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Then we connect two nodes if they differ in exactly one bit place.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, perhaps you can see why these are called hypercubes. This is a cube.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The previous one was a square. What's the next one going to be?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
To generate the hypercube for n = 16, we can do this with a very interesting little trick.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What we're going to do is we're going to take two hypercubes of size 8 and 8.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now 8 and 8 is going to be 16. Let's look at what we can do.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We can leave these bit patterns the way that they are,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and then we can extend them.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Everybody in this hypercube is going to get a 0 in front.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Remember what that means in terms of the binary numbers is that they say the same.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
A leading 0 doesn't change anything,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but this second hypercube everyone is going to get a one out in front.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Again, thinking about your binary numbers, what is that doing?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's adding 8 to all of the number of these nodes,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
giving unique bit patterns that we haven't seen before.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now if we connect the corresponding corners of these two cubes,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
which is going to be a little bit messy, and I can draw them deeper,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but it'll start to make the picture a little distracting.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That is a 4-dimensional cube, also known as a hypercube.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We can keep extending this over and over again--5-bit patterns, 6-bit patterns, 7-bit patterns.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Each time what we're doing is connecting two hypercubes of the previous size,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
extending them and then connecting the corresponding vertices.
