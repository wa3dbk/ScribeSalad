00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What we do is we make a matrix and also a vector.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We label the matrix, which is quadratic, with all the poses and all the landmarks.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here we assume the landmarks are distinguishable.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Every time we make an observation, say between two poses,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
they become little additions, locally,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in the 4 elements in the matrix defined over those poses.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For example, if the robot moves from x0 to x1,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we therefore believe x1 should be the same as x0, say, plus 5,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the way we enter this into the matrix is in two ways.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
First, 1 x0 and -1 x1--add it together should be -5.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we look at the equation here--x0 minus x1 equals -5.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
These are added into the matrix that starts with 0 everywhere,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and it's a constraint that relates x0 and x1 by -5. It's that simple.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Secondly, we do the same with x1 as positive, so we add 1 over here.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
For that, x1 minus x0 equals +5, so you put 5 over here and a -1 over here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Put differently, the motion constraint that relates x0 to x1 by the motion of 5

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
has modified incrementally by adding values the matrix for L elements

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that fall between x0 and x1.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We basically wrote that constraint twice.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In both cases, we made sure the diagonal element was positive,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and then we wrote the correspondant off-diagonal element as a negative value,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and we added the corresponding value on the right side.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Let me ask you a question.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Suppose we know we go from x1 to x2 and whereas the motion over here

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
was +5, say, now it's -4, so we're moving back in the opposite direction.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What would be the new values for the matrix over here?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'll give you a hint.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They only affect values that occur in the region between x1 and x2 and over here.

00:01:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Remember, these are additive.
