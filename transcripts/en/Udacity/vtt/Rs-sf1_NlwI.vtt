If you've been with me so far, you know

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.514
that nucleus is providing only threads and IPC. It

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:09.190
doesn't provide the abstraction of an address space. Because

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.670
this is implemented inside the kernel of the Spring

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.219
system. But, it is not what Spring calls as

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.810
X micro-kernel because nucleus that contains only the threads

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.740
and the IPC. Whereas Liedtke's description says you should

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.600
have all three in the microkernel, and in fact,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.330
the Spring system does have it. It is just that in

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.150
the Spring system they name things

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.490
differently. They call nucleus their microkernel,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.750
but the idea of a kernel in the Spring system contains

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.220
all three entities, even though the nucleus doesn't contain the address space.
