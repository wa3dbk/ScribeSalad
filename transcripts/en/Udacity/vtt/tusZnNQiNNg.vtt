00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.830
So now we have modified our application times two.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.950
We can check that off, and we have one last thing to do.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.150
We're going to add a new feature.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.960
Now before we move on, go ahead and

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.960
check in your changes if you're using version control.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.180
That way, you can start right here before you do any of this stuff.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.850
That's particularly important because this challenge is going to

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.540
be a little bit more difficult than the modification challenges.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.490
Our new feature is going to be a priority button.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.358
So now there will be a little exclamation mark button for

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:35.280
each one of these elements.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.530
When you click on it, the task will be highlighted in red so

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.450
you remember to prioritize it over the others.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.560
Unless it's checked off, in which case it won't be read at all.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.750
Now once again, the CSS has been done for you.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.177
When you add the priority button, give it a class of priority-BTN.

00:00:54.177 --> 00:00:59.510
When a task is marked as prioritized, the LI should get a class of priority.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.020
Now just so you remember that,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.930
I'm putting that information down in the instructor notes.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.990
Now, once again, I'll remind you to be a detective first.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.630
Look around for

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.790
similar functionality, and see where it's implemented if you can.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.575
And if you find something you're curious about, pull up the documentation for

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:22.190
Backbone.js, or do a Google search to try and figure out what's going on.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.060
Go ahead and implement that priority button, and good luck.
