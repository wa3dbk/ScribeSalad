00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.380
Okay Michael.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.000
So here's the definition of
the reward function (s, o).

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.470
It's an expectation over
the set of rewards that

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.190
I'm going to see discounted
at each step by gamma.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.030
So the first reward that I see,
r1 step one, is going to be R.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.460
In Step two, it's going to
be R 2 discounted by gamma.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
In step three, it's going to be
R 3 discounted by gamma squared.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.600
And so on and so forth,
until the option ends after K steps.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.589
And that final reward will be
discounted by gamma to the K minus 1.

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:36.860
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So this is in some sense the average,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.080
in fact in a very particular sense
this is the average discounted reward

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.930
that I will see by executing this
option in this particular state.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.700
Does that make sense?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.940
&gt;&gt; Yes I mean it's I guess it's weird
because it's kind of immediate reward

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.190
in the sense that it's the reward that
comes from executing that one option.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.520
But it's also clearly not immediate
reward it's a sum of rewards.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.959
&gt;&gt; Right, so one way of thinking about
this is remember all an option is

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.400
a policy that I'm going to execute.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.500
That policy will be realized in
specific actions which means it

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.030
will be realized in
a particular states and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.930
rewards that I will see a bunch of
source, source, source, source.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.400
So even though from the outside,
I start here in this particular state.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.710
Some time passes I end up in this state.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.180
What's actually happening along
the way is I'm visiting every single

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.920
one of these states and
picking up reward along the way.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.310
But we need to be able
to discount that reward.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.190
And so the discount factor is hidden
inside of the reward function.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.450
So this is as if rather
than executing the option.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.110
I had actually just executed all
the atomic actions at the option itself.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.410
Will in fact execute.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.520
&gt;&gt; And then you'll call that
sort of one bolus of reward?

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.525
&gt;&gt; Right because all that's
really happening right is that

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:52.315
&gt;&gt; Whenever you have this kind of

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.115
summation over you taking you seeing
a bunch of states and taking a bunch of

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.775
actions, all you're doing is adding up
all the rewards you're going to see.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:01.345
Remember we got the bellman
equation by just writing out that

00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:04.395
we're going to visit
a whole bunch of rewards.

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:08.645
That the definition of the value of
being in the state is the expected

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:09.830
discount of reward.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.350
So we're keeping that consistent
here in this in this abstracted

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.250
temporally abstract actions setting

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.730
by virtue of the fact that still
the immediate rewards are discounted.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.090
According to the true time steps of
the underlying process even though we,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.120
I guess as the agent get to think at
a higher level we get to think about

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.980
an action taking multiple steps.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.140
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly and so
we do something very similar for F and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.230
we end up with this nice equation.
