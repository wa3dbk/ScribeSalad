00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.840
To animate our map over the years of the World Cup, we need two things.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.200
The first of which, is a function to update our map, since we'll be

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.250
repeatedly calling the updates we need to for every year, we want to

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.620
encapsulate it into a function, that we can easily call whenever we need to.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.110
And the second thing we need, is a way to cycle through all the years

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.300
that the World Cup was held, and pass those years to our update function.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.060
For now, let us just focus on writing this first function.
