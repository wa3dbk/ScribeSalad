00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.562
Well, to start off, 0 is the coordinate of any x-intercept. So if we plug in 0

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:11.078
for x in our equation, we get f of 0 equals a to the 0. Now, if I take any

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:16.537
number that a could equal to the 0 power, then we get 1 for f. That means that

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:21.160
the y-intercept of any exponential function of this form, whether it's growing

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.340
or decaying is 0, 1. That's really cool. Bringing it back to decimals again,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.614
I've started us off with the function f of x equals 2 to the x. And we can see

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:38.820
that, yes, in fact, our y-intercept is at 0, 1. As we slide a, either making it

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.868
bigger or making it smaller, the one point that never changes is the 0.01. You

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:49.700
can watch the rest of the curve flip right around that point. It's almost like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.910
a pivot point.
