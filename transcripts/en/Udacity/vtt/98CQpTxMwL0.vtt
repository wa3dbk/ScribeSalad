00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.480
But let's look at each of these choices, one at a time. The first one says yes,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.385
because in order for a result to be creative, it must be novel,

00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:11.840
an output of an algorithm cannot be novel. Well, there are a few problems with

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.640
this particular answer. What if an output of an algorithm for

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.700
a small, closed-word problem cannot be novel?

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.890
The output of combinations of algorithms for open ended problem can and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.460
indeed sometimes is novel. There are algorithms for example, that do design or

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.280
that do scientific discovery, whose results are novel. Let's look at the second

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.910
answer. Yes, because given a set of input, the output will always be the same.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.470
Therefore, the product can never be unexpected. The output will

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.690
depend not just on the input. And not only on the methods of the system, but

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.770
also the situation in which the methods are situated.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.870
The output depends not just on the input under the method the AI agent uses, but

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.740
also the context in which the AI agent is situated. For example,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.840
given the same input but different context or the input, the agent will come up

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.840
with very different outputs, very different understandings of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.420
that same input as we saw in this section on understanding. The third answer,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.180
no because it defines creativity in terms of the output rather than the process.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.750
This answer too has problems, because sometimes creativity can be defined simply

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.880
in terms of the output without knowing anything about the process.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.900
We can think of a black box, that creates very interesting creative music. We

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.283
would not know anything about the process that it is using. But, if the output's

00:01:26.283 --> 00:01:30.660
interesting and creative music, we would consider it to be creative. Personally,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.350
my sympathies lie with the fourth answer. But, of course you are welcome to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.600
disagree with me. Why don't we continue this discussion on the forum?
