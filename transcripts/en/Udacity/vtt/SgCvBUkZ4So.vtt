00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.220
In this lesson, we'll talk most specifically about what you should expect from

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.750
CS7637. We'll start by talking about the learning goals, the learning outcomes,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.180
and the learning strategies that we'll use for this class.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.540
Then we'll discuss the class projects and assessments. That will lead us

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.370
to talking about something called Computational Psychometrics, which is one of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.009
the multi-weighting principles behind the projects in this class.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.470
Next we'll talk about the Raven's Progressive Matrices test of intelligence.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.070
I think you're going to find it fascinating. The Raven's Progressive Matrices

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.370
test of intelligence are the most commonly used tests of human intelligence. And

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.040
that test was the target of the projects in this class. Very ambitious,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.237
you're going to enjoy it. FInally we'll discuss something commonly

00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:48.890
reoccuring principle in this class and you should be on the lookout for them.
