00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.200
All right,
time to look back at our checklist.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.640
Convert a video into a GIF and
display the GIF.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.530
Well, here's the video we recorded and
there it is as a GIF.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.400
So we can check that one off.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.130
What's next?
Add a caption.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.640
What will we need to
do to add a caption?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.370
Up until now, we've had no GIF model.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.090
To have an object to save the caption
to, we'll need to rewrite the Gif class.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.740
We'll also need to implement the caption
text field in the Gif Editor and

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.689
that will require some code
to adjust the keyboard.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.790
Then we'll need to take the caption
that the user inputs and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.340
add it to every image that
makes up our animated GIF.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.200
Super!

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.940
Let's get to it.
