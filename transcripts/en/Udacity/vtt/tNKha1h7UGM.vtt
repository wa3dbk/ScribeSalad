00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the answer is 0.523, 52.3%

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
To see this, first, recognize that these two sequences have the same probability.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The probability with a fair coin of this sequence is 0.125,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
whereas with our loaded coin, the probability is 0.081.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, the probability of either of these sequences of flips is 12.5% if the coin is fair

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and only 8.1% if the coin is loaded.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So, to figure out the probability that the coin is fair, we'll just use Bayes' Rule.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Note that the 0.5 simply represents that there's an equal or 50%

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
chance of having coin 1 versus coin 2.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And this expression equals 0.6080 and so the probability that we have the same coin is simply

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the probability that we both have type 1 or fair coins, plus the probability of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
my having coin 2 times the probability of your having coin 2.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And since the probabilities are the same, since the underlying probabilities were the same for each flip,

00:01:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we have 0.608² plus (1-0.608)² and evaluating this expression gives us our answer.
