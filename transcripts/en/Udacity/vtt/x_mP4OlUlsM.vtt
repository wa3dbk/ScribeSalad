00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.180
The fact is, essentially, any type of psychologist could examine this case.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.270
However, the specific question of why no one reacted when a lot of people saw

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.060
and heard it would be examined by a social psychologist. Cognitive

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.000
psychologists usually look at how people perceive things, remember things, how

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.150
they solve problems and things like that. And a developmental psychologist.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.050
We'll look at how thought and behavior changes or remains the same across the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.840
lifespan. So it might be confusing, because a clinical psychologist deals with

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.980
diagnosing mental illness. And in this situation may help to determine if the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.890
attacker was mentally stable. But again, this question was focusing on why no

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.830
one helped. That could also be the case for a forensic psychologist. A forensic

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.670
psychologist might want to examine the person who committed the crime or the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.530
crime itself. Now, the key here is that even though this question was directed

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.320
towards a social psychologist. A clinical or even a forensic psychologist could

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.440
also examine this case. But I'm going to send you to Greg to talk a little bit

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.140
more about forensic psychology.
