00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.910
We're going to use
the mean shift algorithm

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.310
to find the modes within
that distribution.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.290
By the way, the slides I'm going to
show you, I've showed you before, and

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.380
again these are all over the internet.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.128
It says originally from Ukraine.

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:15.680
It's in Sarel, and if that's who did it,
and I thank you for

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.180
doing these animations,
because everybody uses them.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.250
So the idea of mean
shift is the following.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.970
Here, I have the distribution
of points in some future space.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.970
I plop down some region of interest.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.770
And that region is
drawn here as a circle,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.900
but think of it as a Gaussian blob,
right?

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.255
So, it actually is more weighted in
the middle, than it is to the outside.

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:41.590
Mean-shift tends to work a little bit
better if you have a center waiting.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.530
The reason for that is,
if I've got a hard circle on the end,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.700
then if I move it a little bit, I might
run into a bunch of new points, and

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.060
it'll change my value quickly.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.035
And I'd like to things to always be
smooth when I move things around, so

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:56.575
by having a fall-off in the galaxy,

00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:00.090
and, as I get there sl,
as I get there, those points have a,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.105
a little bit of influence, and
then they gain more influence.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:06.035
So what happens is I put down
this region of interest.

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:09.785
I compute the center of mass,
that's the weighted center of mass, and

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:13.915
the difference between them,
that's called my mean shift vector, and

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:15.215
I just shift my mean there.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:16.830
Isn't that a beautiful animation?

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.940
And what do I do?

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.890
I do it again.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.610
I compute the weighted center of mass.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.520
There it is.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.705
New Mean Shift vector shift it.

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:26.833
[SOUND] Marvelous.

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:27.834
And what do I do?

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:33.667
I do it one more time, and
I keep doing this until I've converged.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:37.701
And there are some interesting proofs
of convergence under some reasonable

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.440
assumptions and,
that finds you this mode.
