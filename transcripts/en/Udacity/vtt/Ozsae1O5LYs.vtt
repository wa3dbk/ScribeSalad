00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.839
So now you've seen that even if we

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.300
can observe a pattern between two variables, we always

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.380
have to consider lurking variables. Referring back to

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.380
our sleep data we see that there's a relationship

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.500
between hours slept and temporal memory but we

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.840
can't necessarily be confident that sleep causes better memory.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.340
What if we wanted to prove that sleep

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.290
causes better memory? Well, if we want to show relationships

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.830
only as with scatter plots, we can

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.400
do observational studies where we just take note

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.940
of already existing data or we can do

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.810
surveys where people are the main subjects and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.040
we ask them questions that we're interested in knowing the answers to. But if we

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.990
want to show causation that one particular variable causes

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.120
another then we'd have to a controlled experiment.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.710
Throughout this course, you'll see a lot of examples of

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.260
controlled experiments. And we're also going to ask you a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.960
lot of survey questions and then we can analyze the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.629
data you give us. Let's take a closer look at surveys
