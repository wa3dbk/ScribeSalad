00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.653
So, so far so good. It looks like CUDA.

00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:06.844
It acts like you would expect, but there are some things you need to watch out for.

00:00:06.844 --> 00:00:11.244
The first of these is that every thread executes the same program.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:15.125
This is standard CUDA, you know, when you write your kernel code,

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:18.087
every thread executes all the lines of that kernel code,

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:24.160
but that means that if you have a kernel launch inside your program, every thread will make that launch,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.597
and if you don't want multiple parallel launches and you only want one,

00:00:27.597 --> 00:00:31.000
you're going to have to explicitly select just one thread.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.834
Otherwise, you get as many launches as you have threads.
