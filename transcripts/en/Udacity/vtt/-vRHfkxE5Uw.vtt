00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.250
Frameworks were created because projects
required the same initial components, so

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.230
developers were doing
the same tasks over and

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.730
over, write out the initial HTML,
add standard default CSS,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.370
and perhaps include some initial
basic JavaScript functionality.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.130
There are many coding principles, but

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.240
two of my favorites are KISS, Keep It
Simple, and DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.880
Instead of doing the same steps over and

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.860
over, developers came up with
a base set of HTML, CSS, and

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.370
JavaScript, and created starter
projects from these files.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.680
These starter projects are used as
a base or framework that can then be

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.930
extended with project-specific code
to create individualized websites.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.870
A framework is built so

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.790
that it encourages you to write your
code following standard patterns and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.030
to put your project's
files in specific places.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.540
This helps to prevent spaghetti code,
to keep everything organized, and

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.520
to make it easier for
new devs to get up and running.
