00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the third choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first choice doesn't work, because it assumes Bob knows Alice's private key.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If Bob knows Alice's private key, then it's not Alice's private key anymore.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The second choice doesn't work because the message is being assigned

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
using Bob's public key.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There's nothing that proves that it came from Alice.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In the third choice, the message is being encrypted using Alice's private key,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which only Alice should have.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Anyone who has Alice's public key, which includes Bob,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
can then decrypt the message.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Then if it decrypts to a reasonable message, they know that it came from Alice.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The correctness of this depends on the inverse property that we saw on the previous quiz.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That in order for signatures to work, we need to be able to do encryption and decryption

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in the reverse order and have them still be inverses using the appropriate private key

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
private key for decryption and public key for encryption.
