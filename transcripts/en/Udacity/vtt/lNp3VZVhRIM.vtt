Now we have come across this particular kind of problem earlier.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.050
This was a classification hierarchy. Vertebrates can be of different kinds.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.500
Bird is one kind. Birds can be a different kind. Eagle, bluebird,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.420
penguin are three classes of birds. Now imagine we have knowledge like,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.200
if an animal has feathers then it is a bird. When we're discussing this

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.230
classification hierarchy we had tried to define the concept of bird, and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.220
we had said at that time that if an animal has feathers it is a bird, and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.320
if an animal lays eggs and it flies then it's a bird.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.290
It is sentences like this that we'll try to put in the language of logic.
