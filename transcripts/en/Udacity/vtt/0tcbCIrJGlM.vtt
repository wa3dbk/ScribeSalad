00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.594
Let's do another example. This is Santa Clara County in California. And let's

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:11.853
say that the mean rent for apartments is 1,830 for all types of units. A

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:15.633
certain rental company called Rental California owns and rents a lot of

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:20.268
apartments. And they want to know if the amount they're renting it for is

00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:25.570
significantly different than this population mean. So they examine a random

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.806
sample of their own units of size 25. They find that on average, they rent each

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:38.958
unit out for 1,700. And the sample standard deviation was $200. You're going to

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:43.400
conduct a one sample t-test for them. Here are the null and alternative

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.990
hypothesis, and remember, they're concerned with whether or not it's

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.710
significantly different. Even though they found that it's less, this will still

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.385
be the alternative hypothesis. And they also want an alpha level of 0.05. First

00:00:57.385 --> 00:01:03.350
of all, find a t critical values for a two-tailed test at alpha equals 0.05.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.300
Put them here and here.
