00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.870
Let's emulate a custom device.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.970
It should have the following
characteristics, a width of 412 pixels,

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.330
a height of 603 pixels,
a device pixel ratio of 3.5, and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.930
then the user agent
string should be this.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.850
You'll find a copy of it
in the instructor notes.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.110
When you open the URL in
the instructor notes,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.010
you'll see a website that looks
a little something like this.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.780
Pop open DevTools, and
then go ahead and start Emulation mode.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.900
When you've successfully
emulated the device,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.980
you'll see a code appear
somewhere on this website.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.890
Type your code into
this box to continue.
