00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.848
For this equation, the final solution was negative 5 and negative 14 5ths. Both

00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:10.900
of these values work for b. Great work if you found these two answers. I know

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.870
one of them was a fraction, and you might not have gotten all the way there.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.115
But I hope you were able to make the substitution for b plus 3 and at least

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:23.058
find the values for u. Let's see how we do that. We can start by making the

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:28.570
substitution u equals b plus 3. So wherever I see b plus 3, replace that with a

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.639
u. Now we want to solve this quadratic equation, so we need to move this term

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:37.110
to the left hand side. So, we'll have a quadratic expression here and 0 on the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.078
right. After subtracting 2 from both sides, we want to try and factor this

00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:47.510
expression. We find factors of negative 10 that sum to positive 9. Those

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.499
factors are negative 1 and positive 10. We use factoring by grouping to get

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.196
these two factors equal to 0. Then, we can set each of these factors equal to 0

00:00:57.196 --> 00:01:03.970
to solve for the values of u. U can equal negative 2, or u can equal 1 5th. So,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.450
since we know u equals negative 2 and u equals 1 5th, we can say b plus 3

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.922
equals negative 2 and b plus 3 equals 1 5th. We solve for this value of b to

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:20.076
get b equals negative 5. Over here, we'll subtract 3 from both sides to get b

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:26.184
equals 1 5th minus 3. We'll change 3 into 15 5ths and then subtract to get

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:28.934
negative 14 5ths.
