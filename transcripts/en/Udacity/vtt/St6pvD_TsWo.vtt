00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.260
Remember how I told you that your editor
is like that steak knife that was

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.510
built to fulfill a specific purpose?

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.490
Well, that wasn't the entire truth.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.390
It's true that most editors have figured
out how to do a great job with basic

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.860
editing, but almost all modern editors
can be extended with functionality.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.840
In Sublime's case,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.760
all of it comes from a healthy
community of developers, like you.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.920
They were missing something and
built it.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.300
And indeed, right now your
Sublime is a genetic text editor.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.509
It doesn't care about you
being a web developer.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.107
In the next step you customize
it with the help of James, so

00:00:29.107 --> 00:00:31.190
it becomes a front-end
development editor.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.240
&gt;&gt; Sublime doesn't have a built
in plug in repository, so

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.000
the first thing we'll need to
do is install package control.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.655
Its the only time we'll manually
need to install a plugin.

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:46.360
We'll take this scary looking
block of text from the notes and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.060
paste it into Sublime's terminal.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.780
And with that it's fetching the plug in
and installing all of the dependencies.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.770
Let's test whether it worked.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.820
Type Command+Shift+P to bring
up Sublime's command palette.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.660
This drop down menu is
useful in many ways.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.760
Because it contains all
the actions Sublime can do.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.000
I generally use it to discover
stuff I didn't know about,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.730
like this toggle comment action and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.070
to execute actions that don't have
shortcuts or have crazy long ones.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.370
But right now, type in P-A-C,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.980
and you'll see many new commands
associated with package control.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.270
The one we really care
about is install package.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.775
This one right here.

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:34.705
This is the list of all of
the packages in the repository.

00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:38.195
So now that we're prepared, let's
install a few of our favorite plugins.

00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:45.100
This list of plugins is also in the
notes for you to quickly copy and paste.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.850
Through package controls and
stall command, please install Emmet,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.000
Sidebar Enhancements,
Color Picker and Color Highlighter.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.600
Some plugins require
restarting the editor.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.590
So to make sure to do that after
you have installed everything.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.205
Emmet dramatically extends and improves
Sublime's built in text snippets.

00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:09.550
Its craziest feature is the ability
to use CSS selectors to create new

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.930
HTML markup.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.890
I know that sounds a bit confusing,
but let me tell you what I mean.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.450
Let's say I need a list with four
items in my index.html file.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.240
I can do that by typing
the CS selector shown here.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.689
Then pressing Tab expands the selector
into the HTML we specify.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.510
Emmet comes with a lot
more built in magic

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.890
that you should definitely check out
in the link in the instructor's notes.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.760
The Sidebar Enhancements plugin has
a pretty descriptive and spot on name.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.960
It mostly extends the right-click
menu of Sublime's

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.830
usually pretty bare-bones sidebar with
all of the stuff you would expect.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.890
Deleting files, new folders and so on.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.690
But also, some nifty stuff such
as copying content as a data URI.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.920
Now, these last two,
Color Picker and Color Highlighter

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.642
work together to make editing and
working with colors in CSS, much easier.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:08.090
Pressing Cmd+Shift+C opens
the system color picker and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.760
allows you to quickly choose a color.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.610
And when the cursor is placed in or

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.770
around an existing color,
picking a new one will update it.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.678
The highlighter outlines or
underlines colors it finds in your

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:24.960
CSS with a preview so you always
have an idea what you're looking at.
