00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.150
Alright, I'm going to hit you with a definition first.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:02.650
&gt;&gt; Hit me.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.270
&gt;&gt; So, conditional independence is this idea that goes

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.220
like this. We're going to say that some variable that

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.860
makes up the joint distribution is conditionally independent of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.250
some other variable, Y, given Z, if it's the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.900
case of the probability distribution governing X, so the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.150
probabilities associated with the values in this variable X

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.490
Is independent of the value of y given the value of z. So if I tell you what

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.590
z is, then you can figure out what the probability of x

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.420
is without having to look at y. So that is, if it's

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.660
the case that for all possible values, little x, little y and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.640
little z for the variables big x, big y, and big z, If

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.110
it's the case that the probability that big X, the random variable

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.170
big X, equals, takes on the value of little x, given that

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.130
big Y takes on the value of little y and big Z

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.690
takes on the value of little z, equals the probability that big X

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.970
takes on the value of x given big Z takes

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.270
on the value of z. If those are equal for all

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.020
possible ways of filling in the values of the variables,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.100
then we say that x is conditionally independent of y given

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.065
z. Right, so you see we dropped Y from the

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.640
right-hand side of the probability expression. Okay, so it's sort of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.730
less things we have to worry about, if it's the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.610
case that we really didn't need it in the first place.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.160
&gt;&gt; Fewer.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.000
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.900
&gt;&gt; So that's pretty similar

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.400
to normal independence. Okay, so what's normal independence?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.210
&gt;&gt; So normal independence, we say the probability of x and y

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.040
is equal to the probability of x times the probability of y.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.430
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.820
&gt;&gt; Which means if we think about the chain rule, we

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.580
also know that the probability of x and y is equal

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.920
to the probability of x given y times the probability of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.000
y. So that means that the probability of x given y is

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.120
equal to the probability of x, for all values of x and y.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.720
&gt;&gt; So this is actually implying. So [INAUDIBLE] if it

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.200
equals that. Oh, that means that P(x) times P(y) equals

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.630
P(x given y) times P(y). If we cancel those, we

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.850
get px equals. Okay. That's what you wanted to say.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.950
&gt;&gt; Right. So, since, What independence means,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520
right, is that the joint distribution between two

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.525
variables is equal to the product of their

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:06.220
marginals. That's just. You know comes from basic

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.440
probability theory and so if you think about what that means

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.220
from the chainable point of view it's like saying the probability of

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.910
x given y is equal to the probability of x. So,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.140
it looks just like the equation you wrote down for conditional independence.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.620
&gt;&gt; Right, the only thing that we added is this notion that it might

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.390
be the case that we don't have such a strong property as this where

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.060
it's always the case that you can write the probability of x given y

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.410
just with the probability of x. But in the context of some, of knowing

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.925
some value z, it might be true. And that's what conditional

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:36.940
independence gives us. As long as there is some z that we

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.100
stick in here, that gives us that property, that's great, we can

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.630
essentially ignore y, when we are talking about the probability of x.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.700
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's pretty cool. That means more powerful or something.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.592
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in fact if you remember you mentioned the

00:02:47.592 --> 00:02:50.130
word factoring. You can see here that we are down a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.020
probability as the product of two other things. We are factoring

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.730
that probability distribution. That's what

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.800
independence let's us do. And conditional

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.970
independence let's us do that in, in more general circumstances. So

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.690
let's apply this content back to what we were talking about before.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.240
&gt;&gt; Okay.
