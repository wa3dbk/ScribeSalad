00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.750
The answer is, it replaces the bottom half with the rotation of the top half.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.822
This question should have been really hard. You have to think about the order

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:11.835
of the numbering of all of the pixels. And imagine everything that happens in

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.838
the right order. You haven't seen a problem like this before. If these were all

00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:21.572
the pixels of the image. This one would be 0. This would be 1. This would be

00:00:21.572 --> 00:00:26.770
picked up pixels minus 1. And this would be picked up pixels minus 2. Now, in

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.670
the first iteration of this loop, we would get color c from the ith pixel,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.630
which would be the 0th pixel. Then we would find picked up pixels minus 1 minus

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.410
i which in this case would be picked up pixels minus 1. Minus zero, so the last

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.654
pixel, and set its color to the color saved in c. So we just copied the color

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:54.310
from here into here. Now, on the next iteration, we'll get the color from one,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.955
right here. Find the pixel at pic.pixels minus 1, minus 1, so right here, and

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:05.038
copy the color into here. It's starting to look like we're just going to rotate

00:01:05.038 --> 00:01:10.008
the whole image. But not quite. Imagine that I gets to this second to last

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:14.414
spot. We'll get the color at the second to last spot, and then we'll get the

00:01:14.414 --> 00:01:19.347
pixel at the second spot. And we'll copy the color from the second to last spot

00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:24.230
back into the second spot. But this is the color the second spot already had.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.738
So the first half of the image won't change. Only the second half of the image

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:29.279
will.
