00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.590
Now that our model is built, let's examine how well it performs.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.910
There are many ways to evaluate models, but

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.950
the bottom line is to evaluate predictive accuracy.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.700
If our model cannot generalize to instances it has not seen,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.990
in most cases it is not a very useful model.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.840
First, we'll evaluate our model on both a training set and a test set.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.550
On the training data, our model produced a mean squared error of 32.87,

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.259
and an R squared of 0.072.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.700
We can also run this cell to visualize the performance of our model.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.320
The green line is our actual interselection times of Starburst.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.640
The blue line represents our predicted interselection time.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.830
Now, we can see a couple of things in this plot.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.240
First, the prediction is missing the occasional bursts and drops in demand.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.520
Second, it seems unnecessarily wiggly.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.580
It's clear that we must return to a choice that we made earlier to

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.550
improve the performance of our model.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.080
Let's continue adding to our diagram on the right side over here.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.050
It's clear that we must return to a choice we made earlier to

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.020
improve the performance of our model.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.150
For example, we might want to revisit the feature selection phase.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.880
Or we might want to switch to a different model to use the same features.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.620
The highly wiggly behavior of our regression function suggests that our

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.610
model suffers from overfitting.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.770
Let's try to address this by returning to the question phase and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.270
reducing our feature set to the top three performing features.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.950
Specifically, we will update our statistical inference problem

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.360
from this expression to this expression in which we

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.070
only use the interselection time of Airheads, Hershey's, and Kit Kat.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.150
Let's add a new Q node to the tree to reflect our update.
