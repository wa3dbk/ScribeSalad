00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.684
Moving everything over to one side gives us the quadratic equation x squared

00:00:04.684 --> 00:00:09.209
plus 2 x minus 15 equals 0. From here, we can factor to find the x values that

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.710
make this equation true. This factors to the quantity x plus 5 times the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.973
quantity x minus 3. And the product of those 2 equals 0. Still, that means to

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:22.940
make this true, x can either equal negative 5 or x can equal positive 3. Now,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.951
let's think about what we're really solving for here. And if we were to do this

00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:31.338
graphcially what we'll working on. Well, here we have two polynomial set equal

00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:35.272
to another. Just like in the previous problem, we can solve this problem

00:00:35.272 --> 00:00:39.387
graphically by setting this side equal to y. And this side equal to y, and then

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:43.796
finding the intersection of those two curves. Let's try it out. You can see here

00:00:43.796 --> 00:00:48.292
that we have two points of intersection on this graph between these two curves.

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:52.300
We have one right here, which we see does in fact have an x coordinate of

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.533
negative 5. And we have one right here, which, if we follow it down, does in

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.860
fact have an x coordinate of positive 3.
