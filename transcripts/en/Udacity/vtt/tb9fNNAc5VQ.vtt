00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.469
So is there any hope of doing better?

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.910
In fact, there's a big clue in the way
we've described the algorithms so far.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.860
Remember that the BFS
visits the graph in waves.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.420
Now this wavy nature of a BFS has
two really important implications.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.070
First, an upper bound on the span
shouldn't be the number of vertices.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.980
Instead, it ought to be
the number of waves.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.700
let's give each wave,
which consists of all the vertices at

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.130
the same distance from the source,
a special name.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.540
Call them levels.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.220
So here's a question for you, what is
an upper limit on the number of levels?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.960
One answer comes from
a particular property of a graph,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.390
called it's diameter.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.313
The diameter is basically the maximum
shortest distance between any pair of

00:00:41.313 --> 00:00:42.150
vertices.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.400
Now here's an important
point about diameter.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.480
It's a property of the whole graph,
so that makes it only an upper bound

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.640
on the number of levels
from any starting vertex.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.060
For example, I claim that this graph
has a diameter of 5, and that's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.470
despite the fact that the shortest
distance from S to any vertex is 4.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.820
Can you see why the diameter is 5?

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.360
I smell a quiz.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.273
Now the process of visiting in a graph,
level by level is sometimes called

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:13.770
a level synchronous traversal, and
that leads us to the second big idea.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.880
If you perform a level synchronous BFS,
then it shouldn't matter in what order

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.900
you visit the vertices
of any given level.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.490
So if I take level two for example,
the fact that I visit this node,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.180
before this node or
this node, before this node.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.570
Really shouldn't matter.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.030
After all, they get the same distance.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.160
Let's be a little bit more precise.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.210
Imagine running a BFS, and
stopping it at some level, call it L.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.320
Now let's look at any two
unvisited neighbors of the set.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.860
Now these both have to be a distance
of just one away from the set, so

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.420
it doesn't matter which
one we see first.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.500
In face, we can even look
at them at the same time,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200
because they'll both
have the same value.
