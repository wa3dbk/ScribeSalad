00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One of the interesting thing about a startup is how is your company going to be organized?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What we now know is the most efficient way to think about

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
all the pieces just all the parts is by a business model.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And so the next question is okay, Steve just told me think about a business model

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but what is a business model?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What are all the pieces? Well let's take a look.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
A business model is how a company creates values for itself

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
while delivering products or services for its customers.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now if you think about it, in the old days we think about

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
how to organize a company around functional organizations.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We think no, a company is about its sales department or its engineering department

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and you would draw a work chart but now where going to draw a very different diagram.
