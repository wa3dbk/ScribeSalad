00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Here is my solution.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
First, we need to decrypt using RSA and the private key.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Before we can do that, we have to convert the cipher to an integer

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and then we apply RSA and the results needs to be converted back

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to bits and padded if necessary.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Next, we break the message into two parts, G and H.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We hash the first part and XOR it with the second part to calculate the nonce.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We then hash the nonce and XOR it with the first part

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to get back to the original bits

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and, finally, convert the bits back to a string.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I’ll leave it up to you to print out the plaintext.
