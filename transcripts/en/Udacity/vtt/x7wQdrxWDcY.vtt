00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.370
Now that Java and Hadoop are installed,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.660
you'll need to set a few environment
variables on the instance.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.950
These will help applications
locate Java and Hadoop.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.930
First thing you'll need to do is
note where open JDK is installed.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.690
To find it you can use readlink like so.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.070
This gives the path to
the Java executable.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.070
But here we want the path
to the directory with jre

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.480
which is the Java runtime environment.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.086
As you can see, mine was installed
at usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64.

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:33.580
But yours might be different.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.560
Probably this directory
you're going to use it next.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.540
You're going to set the environment
variables in .bashrc.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.710
So open the file in
your favorite editor.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.650
First you're going to have a variable
that points to the Java installation.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.010
You're also going to add
the bin directory to the path.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.280
You also have a variable
that points to hadoop.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.656
Finally add a variable that acts as
a shortcut to the hadoop configuration

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:56.630
directory.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.420
This will come in handy later.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.170
With these set, save the file and exit.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.330
Finally load these
variables with source and

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.890
check to make sure those
things are set correctly.
