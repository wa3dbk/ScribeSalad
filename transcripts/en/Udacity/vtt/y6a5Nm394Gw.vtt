00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.920
What do you think?

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.900
&gt;&gt; I think it's hill climbing.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.250
&gt;&gt; Me, too.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.820
&gt;&gt; It's certainly not simulated annealing because there's no annealing.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.250
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.780
&gt;&gt; Simulated or otherwise. You might think

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.110
it's genetic algorithms because you've got all

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.950
of these centers that are all moving around at once, but they're all a

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.000
part of the ultimate answer. They're not

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.380
populations. So it's really hill climbing. You

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.420
just take a step towards a configuration

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.060
that's better than the configuration you had before.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.440
&gt;&gt; That's right, except what we haven't said yet is the

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.620
way we defined hill climbing, it actually evaluated the score and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.690
chose a neighbor that maximized the score. And we didn't show

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.030
that these steps actually do that. We just defined them in

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.110
a particular way. Here's the wicked cool thing. It really does

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.100
do hill climbing. It really does find the neighbor that maximizes

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.020
the score, minimizes the error in this case. So let's show

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.080
that because it's kind of neat. Every time I see this

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.670
I'm always surprised and delighted.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm looking forward to being delighted.
