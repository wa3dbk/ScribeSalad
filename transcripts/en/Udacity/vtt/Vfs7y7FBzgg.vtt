If you counted the batches form the last problem, we know we have 2 and 2 3rds

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:09.184
of a batch. To do that math, I would have done 2 divided by 3 4ths. I was trying

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:13.371
to figure out how mnay times 3 4ths goes into 2. Instead of dividng by a

00:00:13.383 --> 00:00:17.768
fraction, I'm going to multiply by the reciprocal. So I have 2 times 4 3rds. I

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.202
know 2 can be written as 2 over 1, and now I can multiply. 2 times 4 is 8. 1

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:28.245
times 3 is 3, so I have 8 3rds. I'm going to write this as a mixed number. I

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.301
know 3 goes into 8 only two times because 2 times 3 is 6. So I have 3 going into

00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:39.913
8 two times, and then I'm left with two extra pieces. So 2 and 2 3rds.
