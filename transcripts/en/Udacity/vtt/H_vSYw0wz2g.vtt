00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.549
No is the right answer here, if you got it, great work. We can check to see if

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.211
this point is the solution to our system by plugging in the values of x and y, x

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:13.469
is 20 and y is 40. Be careful with the second equation, we know that the x

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.889
should be 20 so we want to make sure we plug that into the second term here.

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:22.498
Just because the variables come in order in our point doesn't mean they'll

00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:27.016
appear in order in our equation. So be careful when you plug in. Our first

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:31.759
equation checks, 20 equals 20. Our second equation doesn't check. We know 40

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.421
does not equal 15. So this point can't be a solution for our system. It's not

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:38.113
the point of intersection.
