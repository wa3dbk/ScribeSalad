00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.400
Ajax stands for asynchronous JavaScript and

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.360
XML request, we can ignore the XML part of the acronym.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.010
For now, let's just think of it as an asynchronous JavaScript request.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.550
Ajax requests allow for content retrieval and

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.059
display without reloading the webpage.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.950
Asynchronous in Ajax,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.750
refers to the fact that the request doesn't block other events from happening.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.730
Instead, the page keeps on doing its thing,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.680
and then only acts on the data when it gets returned by the server.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.390
AJAX requests occur in a number of different ways and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.930
with varying levels of difficulty.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.300
Some require an API key, others use O-off, and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.980
some don't use any authentication at all.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.540
And, the data returned by a different AJAX request differs too.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.360
X in AJAX stands for XML which used to be the dominant hierarchical data format.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.710
But today, JSON is much more popular,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.930
in fact most AJAX requests nowadays are actually a JEDGE request standing for.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.380
Asynchronous JavaScript and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.660
Json request, but it doesn't sound as nice so we still just call them Ajax.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.570
Embedded within Ajax responses, it's pretty common to see HTML,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.210
which websites can use to fill in part part of page.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.010
As part of the project for

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.170
this course, you'll have to try three different asynchronous request techniques.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.040
You'll have to work with the Google Street View,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.520
Wikipedia, and New York Times APIs, all three of which work very differently.
