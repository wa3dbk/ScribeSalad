When we factor an expression like this, we're finding two numbers or expressions

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:08.293
that multiply together to give us what we originally started with. We can

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:12.591
quickly check by using multiplication. If I multiply 9x squared y squared by 5y

00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:16.798
and by 4x squared z. I should wind up with my original statement. This is where

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:21.801
the properties of exponents come in handy. 9x squared y squared times 5y would

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:27.497
be 45x squared y cubed. We add the exponents here. There's a 2 and a 1. And 9x

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:32.986
squared y squared times 4x squared z would be 30 x to the 4th y squared z. 9

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:38.438
times 4 is 36, x squared times x squared is x to the 4th, and then we have y

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.320
squared and z on the end.
