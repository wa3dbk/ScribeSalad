00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.207
Awesome. So now Box2D is created and can be updated each frame. Our next step

00:00:05.207 --> 00:00:09.050
is to add physics body to the world, so that we can simulate them properly. To

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.130
create a physics object, we have to jump through a few hoop. The first thing we

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.885
need to do is actually create a BodyDef object. Now Body Definition object is

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:20.248
going to be used later to actually create our body. But what we do in here is

00:00:20.248 --> 00:00:23.690
that we actually set some specific properties on it. For example, whether or

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.092
not its dynamic or static. Think of static objects as the ones that will never

00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:31.300
move in your environment. Walls, trees, stone chickens, things like that.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.757
Dynamic bodies are the ones that move and can react to physics. Once you've set

00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:37.884
your properties for your body definition, you need then to call

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:42.066
world.CreateBody. This will actually tell Box2D to create a, Physics object

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:46.024
based on the definitions that you just passed into it. And of course, it will

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:49.888
return a handle to this object, so that you can use it too. Once your object

00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:53.112
has actually been created, the next thing you need to do is actually set the

00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:58.040
physics properties on the object. Box2D does this using what they would call a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.525
Fixture Definition. Now fixture definition defines properties that allow you to

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:06.960
set the density, friction, restitution, mass, things along these lines.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.669
Basically how this object is going to interact with the physics of the world

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:13.858
around it. Generally in a game, you'll have groups of objects that all resemble

00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:17.988
the same similar physical characteristics. As such, you may want to go through

00:01:17.988 --> 00:01:21.608
and actually group them into certain types of fixtures. For Grits/g, we

00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:24.414
actually have the majority of objects in the world use a specific fixture

00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:28.342
object that react to the world in the same way. However, we have one type of

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:31.114
bullet that can be launched from the bouncy bullet gun, that actually uses a

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:35.248
different fixture. As such, we allow the entity Def object, passed in from the

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:38.512
user, to actually have a flag defining whether of not this is a BouncyFixture

00:01:38.512 --> 00:01:42.860
object. From there we can actually set the density and friction differently, so

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.610
that it hits the wall and contains its velocity moving forward. As you write

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.691
your game application, it's probably worth while to take into account. How all

00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:51.819
things should react in the environment and use different fixtures

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.756
appropriately. Now, once you've defined the fixture information about how the

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:58.486
world should react with the object, we actually need to define the shape of the

00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:02.324
object. The shape is the most critical, as it defines how this object should

00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:06.358
interact with the rest of the world. Now, Box2D has support for polygons,

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:10.633
circles and oddly enough, boxes, right, who'd the thunk/g? Now it's worth

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:14.471
pointing out, that most physics engines support a suite of whole definitions.

00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:17.591
But give huge performance winds to simplistic wholes like spheres, circles,

00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:21.129
boxes and cubes. Polygons are always an option, but expect to pay a performance

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.019
penalty for the flexibility you're gaining. The fixture definition supports a

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.537
suite of these API's. Such as the SetAsBox method, which of course will define

00:02:28.537 --> 00:02:32.314
the fixture definition as a box. Once you've got all these parameters set, you

00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:35.152
call the CreateFixture method on side of the Body Definition that's been given

00:02:35.152 --> 00:02:39.430
to you. And this will effectively attach the shape and information, to the body

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.762
definition. From there, you're pretty much done. You've got a physics object

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.610
that'll react to the world and do all the things you tell it to do. So go ahead

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.410
and return it out to the calling function.
