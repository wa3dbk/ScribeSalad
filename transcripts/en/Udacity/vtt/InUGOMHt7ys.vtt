00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.100
For the next metal to reuse hit time,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.030
let's revisit the relationship between
the associativity and hit time.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.860
So if we have high associativity in the
cache, we will have fewer conflicts for

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.990
the set in the cache when multiple
blocks go to the same set.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.240
Which leads to a lower miss rate.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.690
And that, we like.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.710
With high associativity we have just
seen, we can build larger, virtually,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.130
index physically, type caches,
which reduces the miss rate, and so

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.540
we like that too.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.030
But high associativity
leads to slower hits.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.080
The hit time goes up,
and that we don't like.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.430
On the other hand, if we go all
the way to direct mapped caches,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.640
the miss rate goes up for
these two reasons, and that is bad.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.740
But the hit time is reduced, because a
direct mapped cache has only place where

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.090
a block can be, so we can quickly
check whether it's there or not.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.480
And we like that.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.540
So we can see that high associativity in
our cache improves the miss rate, but

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.420
makes the hit time worse.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.210
While simple direct mapped caches,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.570
sacrifice the miss rate
to improve hit time.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.940
So now we will see if
we can get this and

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.980
this simultaneously,
by kind of cheating associativity.
