00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.455
The solutions that we described on
how to virtualize memory in inode

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:08.443
clearly indicate that there is
some degree of complexity and

00:00:08.443 --> 00:00:12.997
overhead that have to be incurred
by the due to virtualization.

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:17.405
Given the wide recognition that
virtualization delivers important

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:21.737
benefits and it's been pointed out
earlier in this lesson in that it

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:26.525
presented an important path to address
some of the issues related to rising

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:29.198
operating costs in the IT industry.

00:00:29.198 --> 00:00:34.227
The hardware companies responded and
they modified their architectures

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:38.538
in a way that makes them more
appropriate for virtualization.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:42.680
In the x86 world these virtualization
friendly architectures

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.097
started appearing around 2005.

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:50.818
Read AMD Pacifica and Intel Vanderpool
Technology or LIntel-VT for short.

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:55.732
With respect to x86, so one of the first
things that was fixed was to close

00:00:55.732 --> 00:01:00.725
the holes with respect to those 17
non-virtualizable instructions, so

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:05.337
that they will cause a trap and
pass control over in a privileged mode.

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:09.077
Also, the new protection
mode was introduced.

00:01:09.077 --> 00:01:12.986
So, as opposed to having just one
protection mode with four ranks,

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:16.498
now there are two protection modes,
so root and non-root.

00:01:16.498 --> 00:01:21.206
Also referred to as host because this is
the route is the mode in which the host

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:25.183
operating system, the hypervisor
would run and the non route,

00:01:25.183 --> 00:01:29.618
that's also referred to as guest which
is where the guest VM would run.

00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:32.801
Also, a support was added for
the processor,

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:38.108
the hardware processor to understand and
to be able to interpret information

00:01:38.108 --> 00:01:42.697
that describes the state of
the virtual processors called VCPUs.

00:01:42.697 --> 00:01:46.607
This information is captured
in a VM Control Structure or

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:51.258
also called a VM control block
in the AMD x86 architectures.

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:55.817
The fact that the hypervisor understands
how to interpret this data, so

00:01:55.817 --> 00:02:00.018
it can walk this data structure
is the term that's commonly used.

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:05.918
Means that it can specify whether or
not a system call should trap.

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:09.726
So, it's easy for
the hypervisor to know that a particular

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:13.459
type of operation should not
cause a trap into root mode and

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.256
instead should be handled by the
privilege layer in the non-root mode, so

00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:22.618
the privilege layer in the non-root
mode is the operating system.

00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:24.921
Then other pieces of information,

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:29.918
then that in a certain way can help
reduce the virtualization overhats.

00:02:29.918 --> 00:02:34.609
The next step in terms of virtualization
related advances was to make it

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.237
easier to manage memory.

00:02:36.237 --> 00:02:41.321
Since hardware was already able to
understand the presence of different

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:46.320
VMs, the next step here involved
tagging the memory structures used by

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.338
the hypervisor with
the corresponding VM identifiers.

00:02:50.338 --> 00:02:55.318
So this led to support for extended
page tables where the page table entries

00:02:55.318 --> 00:02:59.678
now include information about
the VMI team and also tagged TLBs.

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:04.394
What this means is that if there is a
context switch am, among VMs that's also

00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:08.837
called the world switch, when we're
switching from one VM to another.

00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:10.690
We don't have to flush or

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.358
invalidate those entries that are in
the TLB that belong to the previous VM.

00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:21.076
This is because the MMU,
when it performs a check against

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:25.977
the TLB entries will try to match
both the virtual address that is

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:30.718
causing the access request as
well as the VM identifier.

00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:32.118
And if they both match,

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:36.747
then it will proceed with the address
that's specified in the TLB entry.

00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:40.887
Otherwise, it will deal with
the page fault failures.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:44.168
As a result, context switches
are now much more efficient.

00:03:44.168 --> 00:03:48.956
Hardware was also extended to add better
support for IO virtualization and

00:03:48.956 --> 00:03:53.668
this included modifications both to
the processor and the chipset side.

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:58.467
And also device and system interconnect
capabilities that were introduced in

00:03:58.467 --> 00:03:59.928
order to support this.

00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:04.925
Some examples of these features include
things like multiqueue capabilities on

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:09.699
the device and you can think of this
as the device having multiple logical

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.528
interfaces where each interface
can be used by a separate VM.

00:04:13.528 --> 00:04:16.752
And also better support
of interrupt routing, so

00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:21.740
that when a device needs to deliver an
interrupt to a specific VM, it actually

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.368
interrupts the core where that VM is
executing and not some other CPUs.

00:04:26.368 --> 00:04:32.018
Additional virtualization related
hardware features were also included for

00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:36.555
stronger security guarantees that
now can be made to the VMs and

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:41.447
also to protect VMs from one another
as well as from the hypervisor.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:47.558
And also, features for better management
support or for more efficiently to be

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:53.028
able to perform various management
operations in virtualized environments.

00:04:53.028 --> 00:04:56.321
You can think of this as
more virtualization friendly

00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:57.938
management interfaces.

00:04:57.938 --> 00:05:02.700
Also, a number of new instructions
were added to x86 in order to actually

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.057
exercise all of these new features.

00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:06.047
For instance,

00:05:06.047 --> 00:05:10.778
a new instruction was introduced to
transition from one mode to another.

00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:16.328
Basically, to transition from root mode
or to return control to non-root mode.

00:05:16.328 --> 00:05:21.084
Or a new instructions to
manipulate in certain ways

00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:25.860
state that's in the per VM
control data structure, etc.
