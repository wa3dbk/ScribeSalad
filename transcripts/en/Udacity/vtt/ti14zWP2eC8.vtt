00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.510
Okay, so this is the first part of the ROB Quiz Solution.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.570
What happens in this first cycle is, again, that this instruction issues. So

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.390
we will have this instruction issuing in cycle one. The issuing is done by

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.600
taking the instruction, putting it in the reservation station and the ROB entry.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.800
The destination registries R2. The instruction's name is ROB1 from now on.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.130
And R3 and R4 we get from R3 and R4. And

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.490
then if you remember we rename R2 to point to the ROB entry. So the correct

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.110
answer here is what ends up in the right here is, we need to put ROB1 there.
