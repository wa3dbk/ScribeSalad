00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here we are down in our post function.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In our success case we want to behave a little differently.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What we want to do is make an art.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
A--that's going to be our art--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
equals a new instance of art.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We're going to pass in title equals title

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and art equals art.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We don't need the pass in created.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Because of the auto<u>now</u>add, we'll automatically get that property.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we're going to create a new instance,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and then to store this instance, we say a.put.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This will store our new art object in the database.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When we're done, we're going to redirect to the front page

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so we don't have that annoying reload message--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the resubmit your form--if we hit reload.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Okay, so let's go ahead and give this a test.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here I am in our browser.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now what should happen is when we submit a valid title

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and piece of art text,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we should store it in our database.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Okay, so I'm going to type in a title.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This title will be camel,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and then I'm going to put some art in our text box here,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is a camel that I copied off of that ASCII art site,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and I'm going to click submit.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I click submit.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We're back on the front page, so we think it worked,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but we really have no way of knowing for sure right now.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So let's add the rest of this feature,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which is going to draw our artwork at the bottom of our form.
