00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.606
The three equations we have here in black boxes are the inverses of the

00:00:03.606 --> 00:00:07.622
equations we started out with. I've written out the steps to find each of these

00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:11.035
inverse functions, and there's one important thing I'd like you to notice. To

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:14.610
indicate the point at which we switch from modifying the original function to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.630
modifying the inverse function, I changed colors. So the first two steps of

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.956
each equation are still working with the original functions. Then at the point

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:27.614
where we switch the position of x and y, we've changed the equation to be the

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:32.100
inverse function. All the work with the inverse function, for each of these, is

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.894
in purple. The actual steps that we've gone through when modifying either the

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:40.270
original function or the inverse function are pretty standard algebra. They're

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.245
things that you learned about very early on in this course. Why don't we take a

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:46.957
look at this middle one just as an example. As we discussed earlier, the first

00:00:46.957 --> 00:00:51.308
thing that I did was switch from calling this g of x to calling it y. Just so

00:00:51.308 --> 00:00:54.284
that when we're moving things around, it's easy to tell what that variable

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:58.610
actually is. We won't get it confused with anything. Then, to change from the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.828
original function to the inverse, I just switch this box of x and y. Since that

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:07.292
if y equals 1 quarter times x minus 9, we have x equals 1 quarter times y minus

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:12.028
9. From there, I multiply both sides by 4, and then I'll add a 9 to both sides

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:16.587
to get y by itself. Since I want g inverse of x on the left side of the

00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:20.032
equation, since that's our standard function notation, I just took one extra

00:01:20.032 --> 00:01:25.049
step to switch the sides of the equation. So that y was on the left instead of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.484
on the right. That gave us a final answer of g inverse of x equals 4x plus 9.

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:35.564
The other two answers we ended up with were f inverse of x equals x minus 1.

00:01:35.564 --> 00:01:39.753
And h inverse of x equals the cube root of x. Now instead of writing cube root

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:43.838
x, you could of course have written x to the 1 3rd power instead. Either way is

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:46.908
correct. I hope this extra practice with inverse functions helped you feel a

00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:50.969
bit more comfortable with the process we have to go through for finding them.
