00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.590
What we're going to do next, is we're going to show our

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.430
designs to three other people, and find out how, we

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.690
as designers, can improve them. How do we make it

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.760
simpler? How can we increase the discoverability? And, what are the

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.695
cues for feedback, and how do we make those stronger?

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.840
For a few tips, see the project brief, on how to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.810
do an effective feedback session with users. Now let's watch

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.110
Clifton, as he shows his designs to Kathleen, a potential user.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.440
Notice how he interacts with Kathleen, and

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.680
in particular, notice how he asks her questions.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.880
&gt;&gt; So Kathleen, imagine you have this new product, this digital wallet,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.520
that you kind of you can trade times with other people. So you start off

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.030
here. And tell me what you see, and what you would like to do?

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.130
&gt;&gt; So, it looks

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.390
like I have,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.520
a bank and my balance right now is three hours, and 10 minutes.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.920
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what, what would you do here?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.350
&gt;&gt; I would probably type in, you know, whatever

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.940
I'm looking for, knowing what that I have my balance

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.920
and start, start looking for you know, a person to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.370
help me. Trade, or do whatever I'm looking to do.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.029
&gt;&gt; Mm, okay. So let's assume you

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:24.830
tap on this you go to this screen.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.490
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say that I'm looking for somebody to clean my

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.100
house so that I have a, an idea to, to keep going with.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.370
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.720
&gt;&gt; And my, my, yeah. And so now I

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.670
think I would see that these are all the people

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.770
who are near me and and what costs they have.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.810
Looks like the red and the green. Red would be,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.770
maybe, by myself. I like that it is. Actually, something that I think it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.860
would be nice is if we actually started with the green and it showed me

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.030
the things that I could afford first,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.140
rather than the things I can't afford because

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.410
that, that seems a little snubbing. Like, hey, look at this, you can't have it.
