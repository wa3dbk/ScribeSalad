00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is: just the keys.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is the point of Kerckhoff's Principle,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that we don't need to keep the encryption algorithm or the decryption algorithm secret,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we want to make those public so they are carefully tested and understood,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and analyzed by many people.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We wanted only to keep this key secret.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The point of the encryption system is to allow us

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to send the ciphertext over an insecure channel,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so that's no longer going to be secret,

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and Alice is just a silly answer.
