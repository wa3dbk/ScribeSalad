00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.576
The 3GS library has many vector operations available. See the additional course

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:08.074
materials for a link to this documentation. My question to you is; For the

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.917
vector three class, which method changes the vector so that it points in the

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:16.542
same direction, but it has a length of one? Here's a hint. This operation was

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:20.696
used to make surface normals on the light direction vector each be one unit

00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:21.053
long.
