00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:03.320
I'm going to start with parametric
regression, which is a way of building

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.130
a model where we represent the model
with the number of parameters.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.990
Let's start with a simple example.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.080
Suppose we want to build a model that
will predict how much it will rain today

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.050
based on changes in barometric pressure.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.140
So as you may know,
if barometric pressure declines,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.030
that usually means there's bad
weather coming and it's going to rain.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.870
And when barometric pressure increases,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.860
it typically means that we've
got good weather coming.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.090
So on this scatter plot each
individual point represents one day.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.680
So let's consider a particular day,
say here.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.155
And what this means is that on this day,
the barometric pressure decreased by 10

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:54.690
millimeters and we had 50
millimeters of rain, about 2 inches.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.040
So let's consider that over time we
collect data for many different days and

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.740
that's what this looks like.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.819
So again, each one of these dots
represents one day's worth of data and

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.590
we have multiple day's
worth of data here.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.340
And as you can see there's a general
trend of as barometric pressure

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.980
decreases, we typically have more rain
and as it increases we have less rain.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.880
We'd like to create a model based on
this data that when we query it at any

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.760
particular point it'll give us a
prediction of how much is going to rain,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.380
so we would measure
barometric pressure or

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.900
its change and
then estimate how much is going to rain.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.120
The classic solution to this problem
is to fit a line to the data.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.770
So let's give that a shot.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.000
As you probably know, this approach
is called linear regression.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.110
And the model looks like this.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.642
So if you remember, from algebra in
elementary school, or high school,

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.967
wherever you got it.

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:56.050
[LAUGH] The equation for
line is simply y equals mx plus b.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.760
So x is our barometric
pressure change variable here,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.030
and m and
b are the parameters of our model.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.980
Our model now is fully described by
these two parameters, and if we want

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.190
to estimate or query how much it's
going to rain at any particular point.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.620
We measure the barometric pressure.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.727
Let's say the barometric
pressure today increased by 5.

00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:32.149
We would then plug that 5
into our model here and

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.143
multiply it by m and add b.

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:38.780
And that's our estimate for
that day of how much it's going to rain.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.460
And the linear regression approach
is how we arrive at m and b.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.930
This model is decent, but

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.890
it doesn't track the actual
behavior of the data, for instance,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.290
in this region and in this region,
so we can make a more complex model.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.530
Instead of fitting a line we can fit
a polynomial, we can add one more term x

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.910
squared and now we've got to also
find this additional parameter m2.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.130
So, when we find our model it's now
represented by three parameters

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.910
mm2 and b.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.660
This polynomial model will
look something like this.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.670
It fits the data pretty well over here,
but not so well over here.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.260
Now, we can add more terms.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.350
We can fit an x cubed term and
have another parameter and so on.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.110
In general, these parametric
approaches come away with

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.500
a number of parameters, and the more
complex the model, the more parameters.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.390
Still, three parameters
is a pretty simple model.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.780
All of these models, whether it's
linear, with just mx plus b, or

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.680
polynomial, with a cubed or
squared term, are parametric models.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.740
In the end, after we learn these models,
we have our parameters,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.510
in this case, m2, m, and b.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.790
And we throw away the data,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.290
and the model's represented
just by these three parameters.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.080
But there's another way to approach it,
and I'll show you that next.
