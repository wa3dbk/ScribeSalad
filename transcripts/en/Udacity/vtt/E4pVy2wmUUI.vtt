00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.404
Now that we've found out another 0 of our function, we should automatically

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:08.538
know what one of its factors is. One of its linear factors to be precise. So,

00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:14.266
what factor is associated a 0 of 1 half. Please fill in just integers in these

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.738
two boxes, and make sure that the numbers you fill in have a greatest common

00:00:17.738 --> 00:00:19.704
factor of 1.
