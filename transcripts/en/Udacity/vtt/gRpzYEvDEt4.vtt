00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.178
There must be a shorter way, though, than doing all this work. That's a lot of

00:00:04.178 --> 00:00:08.617
writing, and I don't want to do that every time I work with an exponent. So what

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:12.506
else is going on here? Maybe you can find the pattern. Take a look at the

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:16.790
exponents on the left and the exponents on the right and see if you can answer

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.285
this question. What general rule can you find for raising this base and power to

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:23.579
another power? Choose the best answer.
