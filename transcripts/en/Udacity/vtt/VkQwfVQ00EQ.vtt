00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.070
When we run the code, we get this output. And

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.920
notice how we have friend count split by females, and then

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.530
by males. And it looks like the median and the mean

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.870
friend count is greater for females. So here the answer was

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.230
women. Now the difference between the median friend count for

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.370
men and women is 22. That's just subtracting these two numbers.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.310
Now, something I want to draw your attention to is the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.600
mean Notice how the mean for friend count is higher than

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.820
the median for both females and for males. This should

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.790
make sense since our data is long tailed. So these

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.230
higher values out and the higher friend counts our kind of

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.420
pull our mean to the right. For this last question,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.830
the median is a better measure than mean because it's

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.530
a more robust statistic. A few people with huge friend

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.910
counts drag the mean upwards which isn't necessarily representative of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.480
most users. What's nice is that the median's resistant to change,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.820
since it marks the halfway point for all data points. So as long as we trust

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.480
half of our values, we can report a

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.740
reliable location of the center of our distribution.
