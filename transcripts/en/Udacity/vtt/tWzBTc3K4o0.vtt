00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Those last two examples--"July-August 1842" and "6*9==42"-- suggest that we need more

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
control over splitting strings, because we might want to split on things other than spaces,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
like hyphens or punctuation.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to introduce a tool that will help us do just that--a tool called "regular expressions."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Suppose we want to find all the numbers in a string.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We could make 10 different calls to string.find, look for 1, look for 2, look for 3.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We don't know what digit the number begins with, so we might have to try all of these,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but that could get really tedious really fast.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Instead we're going to use this new technique

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that I'm just about to teach you--regular expressions.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The word regular has special meaning in mathematics and computer science theory,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but for now it just means simple strings, and expression is just a concise notation.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You may have already seen this in some math classes, but not thought about it in this manner.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If I write a mathematical expression, like x is equal to the square root of 4

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
or 5 is less than x is less than 9, each one of these admits or corresponds

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to some possible values for x.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
For example, if x is between 5 and 9 then it could be 6 or 7 or 8.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
All of those are good. All of those satisfy this mathematical equation.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
All of these match this mathematical equation.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Similarly, we often think of the square root of 4 as being just 2,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but actually negative 2 works just as well-- -2 times -2 is 4.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
These mathematical equations are concise notations for a possibly large set of values,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
especially if I do something like this.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There are a large number of possibilities--51, 51, all the way up to 89-2

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and just writing this out took much less room.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Just as mathematical expressions are very concise and let us match or describe

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
a large number of integers or numbers,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
regular expressions are going to be very concise and let us

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
describe a large number of simple strings.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here is our first regular expression.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Bracket 1 hypen 3 closed bracket.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is associated with the three strings 1, 2, and 3.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Formally we say that a regular expression like this matches or denotes all of these three strings.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The basic idea here is there is some symbol on the left and some symbol on the right,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and this regular expression matches each one of those plus everything in between.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For example, the regular expression 4 hyphen 8 matches 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and the regular expression A through B matches the string a and the string b.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Perhaps surprisingly, regular expressions are very popular and very useful online

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and in computing in general.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Credit cards, phone numbers, addresses, e-mail addresses--

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
these are all handled by regular expressions on websites

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
you've probably all ready used under the hood. Let me show you a compelling example.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Here I have the form from the U.S. State Department for applying for a U.S. passport.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Regular expressions are very common when you want to enter structured data or structured strings.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
For example, over here they regular that your birth date be specified as

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
two digits, two more digits, and four more digits corresponding the month, the day, or the year.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
By contrast, your place of birth is more likely to include letters rather than numbers.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
A U.S. social security number involves three numbers, two more numbers,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and then four more numbers sometimes separated by a hyphen or a blank.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
An email address has to have this special @ character in it.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Regular expressions can help us do that.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Then an American phone number also has some number of digits broken up into various groups.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
A billing address might have letters and numbers and number signs combined arbitrarily.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Regular expressions are going to allow us to make sense of this type of data

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.169
and also process it when we see it on web pages.
