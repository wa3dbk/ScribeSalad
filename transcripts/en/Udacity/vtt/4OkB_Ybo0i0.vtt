00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.530
On the left side here,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.430
we have a box labeled Source, which we can think of as our raw data file.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.080
Maybe a CSV, or in this case a JSON file called my-data.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.770
And as we go through the pipeline of the grammar of graphics,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.400
we can think of it as applying a different transformation to each step.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.600
Going from source, to variables, to algebra and so

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.450
forth, until we render the final graphic on a web page.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.900
In D3's case, the renderer is simply the web browser and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.300
the browser displays the final graphic in the form of a webpage.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.170
Going from a JSON source file, in this case my-data.json, into what the grammar

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.870
of graphics calls Variables, is implemented by D3's data loading functions.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.220
Specifically, D3.json if loading a JSON file.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.240
When called with a data file,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.470
D3 makes an Ajax request to load whatever your data file is.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.000
In this case, my-data.json, and turns it into an array of JavaScript objects.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.270
I don't want to get too hung up on the specifics of each stage of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.810
this grammar of graphics pipeline, or try to relate them to d3

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.200
junctions that we may not have encountered yet, such as nest, scale, and layout.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.040
But I did want to cover some of the more common d3 functionality and

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.340
how it relates to the grammar of graphics.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.560
In this pipeline, once we have our JavaScript array of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.270
JavaScript object literals, nest is a function that I encourage you to look up.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.240
But it simply groups our data, d3.scale transforms a continuous or

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.340
a categorical variable into something that a web page can display,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.860
such as a pixel value or a color.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.140
The d3 layout function is a convenience function that allows us to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.280
apply a common transformation, according to a set of predefined

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.400
chart layouts we might want, such as a pie chart, a histogram or a graph.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.520
.append in d3 is what actually inserts our SVG or

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.640
HTML elements, which we've already seen.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.139
In this case, .append rect puts rectangle SVG elements.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:15.880
For every data point, .attr changes some attribute of whatever we're appending.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.230
In this case, rectangle .attr x, changes where we want to position our

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.170
rectangle, its x coordinate, and specify the value where we want to position it.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.570
And last but not least,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.890
we can control the aesthetics of our visualization, either through d3 and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.650
specifying attributes on the style, or by using CSS selectors and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.970
CSS specification to, in this case, fill our rectangle with a green color.
