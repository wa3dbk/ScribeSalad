00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.210
This lecture has presented an architectural design process using the text

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.490
browser as a case study. The main result is a breakdown of system functionality

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.240
into components. Also, the components are assigned responsibility for

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.920
maintaining important system invariants. However, we haven't yet dealt with with

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.810
the non-functional requirements, which is a major concern of software,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.350
software architectural design. We will address this issue in a later lesson.
