00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.840
Code reviews are an effective technique for detecting defects in artifacts.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.050
Collected data indicates that for typical formal review, as described above,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.680
between 70 and 90% of defects are found. That is,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.890
if we're talking about a code review of all the defects in that code,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.175
the review meetings are going to find between 70 and

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:23.100
90% if you have effective reviews. Of course, there is a cost which amounts,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
in typical situations, to between 10 and 20% of the total cost of development.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.760
This cost is largely due to the staff time involved in the preparation work and

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.991
the review meting itself. The above data notwithstanding,

00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:39.413
defect detection rates vary dramatically depending on the specific rule goals,

00:00:39.413 --> 00:00:43.210
artifact complexity and how effective the meanings are themselves.
