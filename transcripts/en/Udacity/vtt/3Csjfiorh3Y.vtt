00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.547
So you're used to the idea of bulk parallelism.

00:00:02.547 --> 00:00:05.775
This is where you break down a problem, an array for example, like this,

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:11.248
into a series of threads each operating independently and simultaneously on the data.

00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:17.996
So imagine I've got a series of numbers, and I want to scale everything by a factor of a quarter.

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:20.163
So then I would take each of these numbers,

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:23.759
each thread would operate on them independently, and I would end up with my result.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.096
This is bulk parallelism because everybody is operating at the same time without any dependencies.
