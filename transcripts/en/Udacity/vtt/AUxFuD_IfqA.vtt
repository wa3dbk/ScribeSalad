00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.250
I want you to recall one particular

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.640
memory consistency model that I've discussed with you

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.080
before, that is sequential consistency. And in sequential

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.480
consistency, the idea is very simple. The idea

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.640
is that every process is making some memory

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.940
accesses, all of these, let's say, are shared

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.590
memory accesses. And from the perspective of the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.140
programmer, the expectation is that, these memory accesses

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.270
are happening in the textual order that you see

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.430
here and that's the expecation so far as this

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.530
programmer is concerned. Similarly, if you see the set

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.080
of memory accesses that are happening on a different process

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.770
of p2. Once again, the expectation is that the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.490
order in which these memory accesses are happening are

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.980
the textual order. Now, the real question is, what

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.810
happens to the accesses that are happening on one processor

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.760
with respect to the accesses that are happening

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.630
on another processor if they are accessing exactly

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.030
the same memory location? For instance, P1 is

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.290
reading memory location a, P2 is writing to

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.970
memory location a. What is the order between this read by P1 and this write by

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.040
P2? This is where sequential consitency model says

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.130
that the interleaving of memory accesses between multiple processors,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.040
here I'm showing you two, but you can have n number of those processors. Making

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.190
accesses to shared memory all in parallel.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.420
When that happens you want to observe the textual

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.680
program order for the accesses and the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.290
individual processes but the interleaving of the memory

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.800
accesses coming from the different processors is arbitrary.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.200
So in other words, the sequential memory consistency

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.960
model builds on the atomicity for individual read-write

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.770
operations and says that, individual read-write operations are atomic

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.560
on any given processor, and the program order has

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.760
to be preserved. And, in order to think about

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.530
the in, interleaving of the memory axises that are

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.000
happening on different processors. That can be arbitrary and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.460
that should be consistent with the thinking of the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.228
programmer. And I also gave you the analogy of

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:13.015
a card shark to illustrate what is going on with a sequential consistency model.

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:20.250
So the card shark is taking two splits of a card deck and, doing a perfect

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.930
merge shuffle of the two splits, and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.550
that's exactly what's going on with sequential consistency.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.410
If you can think of these memory accesses on an individual processor as the card

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.410
split but instead of a two-way split you have

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.930
an n-way split, and we are doing a merge

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.780
way shuffle of all the n-ways. Splits off the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.840
memory accesses to get the sequentially consistent memory model.
