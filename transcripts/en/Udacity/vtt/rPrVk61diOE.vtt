00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.160
Now let's start defining some
basic operations on vectors.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.790
The first operation we will describe for
vectors is addition.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.490
One way to visualize the sum of two
vectors is to lay them end to end.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.610
The arrow formed starting at
the tail of the first arrow and

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.350
ending at the head of the second
arrow gives the overall total amount

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.410
of change by the two vectors.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.750
This new arrow is the sum
of the first two vectors.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.490
In addition to this geometric
interpretation of vector addition

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.660
we have a numeric interpretation.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.260
Given the first two vectors as a list of
coordinates, we can add the two vectors

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.440
by adding the corresponding
coordinates of each vector.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.710
Since this first vector is [1 2] and
the second vector is [3 1].

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.660
There are some vector is [4 3].

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.180
Notice that if we lay out
the vectors in a parallelogram shape

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.460
the sum vector connects the points or
both chains of vector start

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.670
in this case the origin and
where the chains both end.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.069
We can subtract vectors in
addition to adding them.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.520
Here is the geometric interpretation
of vector subtraction.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.100
Consider the vectors the v and
w both emanating from the same point

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.910
what vector would we need to add
to w in order for the sum to be v?

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.760
We represent this geometrically by
drawing an arrow from the head of w

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.000
to the head of v.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.150
This vector is what we call v- w,
since w + the vector v- w equals v.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.200
Numerically we can compute
the difference between two vectors by

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.310
subtracting their
corresponding coordinates.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.205
So taking this vector to be [1 3] and
this vector to be [5 1],

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:49.055
their difference is [-4 2].

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:52.570
This is reflected in our drawing
since the difference vector

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.440
represents a change of four units
to the left and two units up.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.070
This time, if we look at our
parallelogram formed by x and y.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.100
Notice that x- y connects the heads of
the two initial vectors in our chains.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.250
If we reverse the direction of
this arrow, we'll obtain y- x.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.640
Another important operation on
vectors is scalar multiplication.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.330
In this case a vector is multiplied
by a number which we call a scalar.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.000
The term scalar is suggestive
of the word scale.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.510
Which is fitting because the geometric
interpretation of scalar multiplication

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.300
is to scale the size of a vector.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.930
Multiplying a vector by
2 doubles its length.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.980
Multiplying a vector by 1
keeps it the same length.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.020
Multiplying a vector by 1/2
cuts its length in half.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.320
We can also multiply a vector
by a negative number.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.830
This reverses the direction
the arrow points

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.320
in addition to possibly growing or
shrinking the vector.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.910
Numerically scalar multiplication
is computed by multiplying

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.790
each coordinate of
the vector by the scalar.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.683
So, 2 times the vector
[1 2] equals[ 2 4] and

00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:13.650
-1/2 times the vector [3 2 1]
equals the vector [-3/2 -1 -1/2].
