00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
And the answer here is not actually

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.130
3 of those statements, those 3 down here are correct.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.890
I'll explain them in a minute, and this one here is not correct.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.060
So the formula indeed does have a satisfying assignment.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.260
Not only one; it actually has several satisfying assignments,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.090
but each of those assignments has the property that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.670
exactly one variable is set to true,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.240
and I'll show you in a second how that works.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.740
And of course--I mean, the last thing was probably quite easy to figure out;

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.730
as you see this already has kind of a square shape,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.980
so if we continue like this and add another variable here,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.090
then we would have to add another line down here,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.790
and each of those formulas grows by 1 and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.860
the whole thing grows by one of those brackets here

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.860
for each variable that we add,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.630
so the size is O(n squared) for n variables.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.050
So let me explain this here to you.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.250
So there are several satisfying assignments,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850
but each of those satisfying assignments has the property

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.500
that exactly 1 variable is true.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.010
So for example, let's say that we set

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.530
X1 to true,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.000
then what will happen is the following,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.020
so X1 is true; this means this one down here goes to 0.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.630
This one goes to 1, this one goes to 1, this one goes to 1,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.610
this one goes to 1, and this one is 1.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.530
So let's have a look here

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.080
at this part of the formula.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.920
All of the variables here are connected by an or,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.990
so we have X1 or X3 or X4 or X5 or X6.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.710
This means if just one of the variables here

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.410
is set to true,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.060
which it now is,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.060
then the whole bracket here,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.810
so from here to here will also evaluate to true,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.390
and then we take this very, very big not here,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.230
which means this will evaluate to 0.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.160
Now this very big not here evaluates to 0,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.900
then we have to make sure that this variable here

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.960
evaluates to 1,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.250
because all of them are connected by an and,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.290
and we are looking for a satisfying assignment,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.290
so to do that, we have to set X2 to 0

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.450
so that this here evaluates to 1.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.890
Now for the next bracket, it works the same way,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.830
because again, we have X1 set to true,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.850
so the bracket evaluates to true,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.670
so the not evaluates to 0,

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.320
and so again we have to set this to 1

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.000
which means X3 is 1

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.040
and we can go on through this the same way.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.550
So the formula forces us to set every variable except for X1 to false,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.340
and now the way that this formula is structured, of course,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.130
we could also have chosen to set X2 to true,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.400
but then if X2 is set to true,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.220
we have this here, so X2 here is 1, 1, 1, 1,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.000
which means in order to get these here to go to 1,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.310
so we need to have these here go to 1,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.960
because this here evaluates to 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.440
so we have to set all of these variables here to false.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.090
Yeah, finally, what about this one here?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.800
Well, since X2 is set to true,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.240
not X2 is set to false,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.700
but luckily, because we've set all of the variables to false,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.700
so we have 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.900
In this case, the large not here

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.330
evaluates to true,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.910
so this bracket here also evaluates to true,

00:03:15.910 --> 99:59:59.000
and we have satisfied the Boolean formula.
