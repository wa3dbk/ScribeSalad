00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I would say approximately linear--if you go to the barchart, you'll find that these bars

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
kind of nicely lined up almost like a line with an exception that over here it levels off a little bit.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Linear seems to be a good guess as to what's happening--wage increases linearly with age.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The reason why it's not exact is more obvious from this scatter plot which shows the raw data.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You can see even with higher ages around 40, they're still individuals that earned

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
relatively little money--so for the data to be linear, we get these to line up exactly

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
on the straight line which is not the case in this data.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
On average, the relationship might be linear, but when it comes

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to the exact data points, it's clearly not linear.
