00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
Rather than having each thread read 3 neighboring elements,

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.789
average their value, and write a single output result,

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:08.271
we can have each thread read a single input result

00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:12.267
and add 1/3 of its element's value to the 3 neighboring elements.

00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:17.284
So each of these writes would really be an increment operation.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:20.177
You can imagine the same thing on our 2D image blurring example,

00:00:20.177 --> 00:00:23.154
where each thread takes 1 input element or pixel

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:26.877
and writes a fraction of its value to the neighboring pixels.

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:31.743
So when each parallel task needs to write its result in a different place or in multiple places,

00:00:31.743 --> 00:00:35.576
we call this scatter because the threads are scattering the results over memory.

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:38.276
You can see already a problem that we're going to have with scatter.

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:44.104
You've got several threads attempting to write to the same place at more or less the same time.

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:47.203
This is something we'll have to talk about later.

00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:50.692
Let's have a quick quiz on this. Suppose you have a list of basketball players.

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:53.524
So you've got a bunch of records and each one has the name of the player

00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:57.547
and the height of the player, and the rank in the height, okay?

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:02.311
So in the league or on the team, whether this is the first tallest, the second tallest,

00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.987
the third tallest, the last tallest, or so on, okay? So you've got the rank and height.

00:01:06.987 --> 00:01:11.686
And say that your goal now is to write each player's record into its location in a sorted list.

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:16.584
So if we implement this in CUDA by having each thread read a record and look at the rank

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:19.916
and use that rank to determine where to write into the array,

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:25.015
is this a map operation or a gather operation or a scatter operation?
