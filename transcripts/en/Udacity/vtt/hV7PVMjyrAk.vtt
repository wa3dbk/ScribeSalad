00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.430
Now that you feel you've gotten
good feedback on your app ideas,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.580
you might find that one's
emerging as a clear winner or

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.290
you still might not be able to decide.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.730
Either way,
it's a good idea to research and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.240
vet multiple app ideas
before deciding on one.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.490
You never know when you might run into
a dead end and not be able to continue.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.290
In the next few nodes, we're going to
start thinking about UI elements and

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.700
web APIs and libraries to use, for each
of the three app ideas that you have.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.570
Thinking through this for

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.200
each of them will help you have
a better rounded picture and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.100
make a more informed decision when
you're ready to start development.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.570
First, let's start thinking about UI.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.350
The following series of questions will
help you start thinking about how users

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.690
might interact with your apps.
