00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.140
The fourth line here, with a call to add series,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.050
simply specifies what type of chart we would like to make.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.360
In this case,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.550
we pass a dimple.plot.bar chart to the add series called on my chart.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.170
In nuance here, that we'll get into later,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.230
this first mysterious argument that we pass in as null.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.260
Dimple J S, being the high level charting library that it is,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.450
allows us to facet our data or droop it by another column.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.480
If we wanted to say plot our data by attendance per year but

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.680
also droop it by let say the stage of the World Cup, we could pass as the first

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.850
argument to the series stage, which will first group our data by stage and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.490
then make a bar plot of the specified axes on the chart.
