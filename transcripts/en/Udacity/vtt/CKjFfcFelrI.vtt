00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.400
Before we go ahead and build a content provider

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.280
you wouldn't be out of line to ask, well why.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.060
The simplest answer is that it allows you to

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.540
share your data safely and efficiently across app boundaries by

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.520
abstracting the underlying data source, be it SQLite like

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.080
this or files or really anything else. So that other

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.870
apps can access it without really needing to understand how

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.650
you stored it. In fact, the calendar, SMS, and contacts

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.620
APIs work that way, using shared content providers.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.780
We're going to share our weather database later, but if

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.370
you're not planning to expose your app's data, you're

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.160
probably thinking you can skip this bit, right? Well,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.770
almost, in a lot of cases you could,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.970
but really shouldn't. For example, in Sunshine we're using

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.380
SQ Lite. But you could be storing data in

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.680
files, dynamic run-time data or even just a different

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.040
database library. By using content providers, it's easier for

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.380
you to potentially switch out the data source and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.740
much easier for someone other than you to manage

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.410
the UI layer code without them having to understand

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.459
the depths of your data storage implementation. On the

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.070
UI layer, it's a generic mechanism that returns cursors.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.270
The same of those returned by SQLite databases. So,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.690
if your data layer implementation changes, then your content provider

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.390
is effected. Still, it's just you writing the code right

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.520
now and that's a lot of boilerplate for the sake of

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.690
following a neat design pattern. Well, keep in mind that

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.730
as far as the framework is concerned, all data is handled

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.027
through content providers. So, if you want to interact with

00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:33.790
anything outside of your app, such as sending data to a

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.770
widget or returning search results from the newer app, you'll need

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.770
a content provider for that too. In fact, that's how the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.760
Google play store and Gmail widgets work. As well as the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.920
ability to get search results from Google Play. Similarly, there's a bunch

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.960
of APIs designed to optimize the process of synching and querying data,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.580
and updating UI accordingly. And all of them also expect content providers.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.950
That includes sync adapters and cursor loaders. Which make your

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.140
app able to efficiently sync with your server, load data in

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.360
your UI layer, and which include built in content observers that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.167
will update your UI automatically when the underlying data changes. You

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:17.680
could, of course, build all of that yourself but at

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.350
a certain point the advantage you gained by not writing a

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.280
content provider to begin with is lost in the process of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.900
having to recreate all of the useful clusters that utilize it.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.160
We'll take a look at publishing your content provider and using Lotus

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.980
to access it efficiently later in this lesson. And we'll explore sync adapters

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.820
in lesson six when we look at doing efficient background updates. But

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.390
first, Dan is going to show you how to actually build a content provider.
