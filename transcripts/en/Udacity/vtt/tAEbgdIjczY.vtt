Well, we know that if we only look at x as less than 3, this would be the

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:07.345
interval we would have. And, if we were only to look at x as greater than 7, we

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:11.333
would have this. Remember that interval notation shows us what the minimum and

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.130
maximum values that x is limited to are. And, of course, whether or not those

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.987
are included are shown by the brackets. But, in this case, we need to include

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:23.704
both of these regions. We do this by showing a u between the two of them. This u

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:28.485
here, stands for union. All the values that it can take on are shown by having a

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:33.404
union of this region with this region. We're taking all these numbers from both

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:38.229
areas and putting them together in one big heap. X will be somewhere in that one

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:39.591
big group of numbers.
