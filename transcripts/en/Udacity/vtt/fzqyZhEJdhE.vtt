00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.490
Let us do an exercise together.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.680
Once again, we have the four
quadrants shown here, and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.260
at the top left are four
compression artifacts.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.175
I'm sure you're familiar
with all four of them.

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:14.380
C-3PO is a fictitious
artifact from Star Wars.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.940
Can we put these four artifacts in
the quadrants to which they best belong?
