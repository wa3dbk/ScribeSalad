00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For this problem, we're going to write a lexer that's able to go through and create tokens

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for each of the JavaScript keywords and also ignore JavaScript comments,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which are specified with little stars for long comments,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
just a slash and a star--this is a multi-line comment--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or just a slash, slash which comments everything for the rest of the line.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So we've got 2 types of comments to handle.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We did this 1 in class, but this one you're going to have to use some state variable

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
like we did with HTML in class.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So let's see how that's done.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So here I have the solution.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The first thing, which we gave you, was the long list of tokens--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the names and what they should match.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So if I scroll down, I have them all defined.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's a little tedious, but it's what you have to do, and it's only a 1-time thing you have to do it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The only thing you really have to keep in mind is you have to escape characters

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that are particular to a regular expression.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So freezing means you escape the parenthesis.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We need to escape the pipes, plus, star--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
things that have meaning in a regular expression.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So the other major part of this problem was handling the comments.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We have the end-of-line comment, which we did in lecture, and that's almost exactly the same.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If you see 2 slashes, no matter what follows you simply pass by it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But what we're going to have to handle, just like we did with HTML,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is if we're in a block comment--a multi-line comment, which is indicated by

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the slash, a star, blah, blah, blah, blah, and another star and a slash,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we assign our states.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We have a state called comment, and it's exclusive when you're in a comment,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and you're not in anything else.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
A comment begins with the slash and the star, which is indicated right here.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You have to escape both of them since they both have meaning.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And then we begin the comment.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We're done when we see the other star and then the slash.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We increment our line count based on how many things we've passed by,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and then we go back to the initial state.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We need to remember an error for when something goes wrong,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and then down here, I've defined what we want to ignore for the comment state,

00:02:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and it's the same exact stuff that we ignore when we're tokenizing the rest of it.
