00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, for this last question, I'd like you to  prove

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that the 4coloring problem is NP-complete,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.500
assuming that it's already known that 3coloring is NP-complete.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.000
And we're going to do that by writing a program that models the reduction proof.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.500
So let's say we're given a magical graph is 4colorable function.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.500
Now, in order to perform this reduction program, we're going to give you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
a function graph is 4colorable.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And this function takes as input a graph in the form of an adjacency matrix,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
like we've previously discussed, and it returns a boolean--either true or false--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
indicating if the input graph is 4colorable in polynomial time.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, what I'd like you to do is define a function graph is 3colorable that, again,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
takes an adjacency matrix as input and returns a boolean

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.500
indicating if the input graph is 3colorable in polynomial time.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, as I said, the point of this is to show that the 4coloring problem is NP-complete.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So we'll want you to do a reduction program reducing the graph

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that is taken as input to 3colorable and change it into a graph

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that is an input to 4colorable to show this reduction.
