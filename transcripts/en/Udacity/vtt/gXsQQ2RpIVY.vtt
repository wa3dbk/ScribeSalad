00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We want to break up strings like the source to a webpage into important words,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and we're going to use Python to do it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're given as input part of a webpage like this--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
"Hello 1" with some syntax over here on the left that we'll get to in a bit.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
One approach to breaking this up would be to use Python's string.find function

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to find this space and then split up the string into everything to the right of the space

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and everything to the left of the space.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You may already be familiar with Python's string.find function

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
from previous experience with computer science.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But if you're not, it's often described as finding a needle in a haystack.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
For example, let's say that I want to find the "fun" in "Mifune Toshiro."

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is our needle, and we're going to look for the first copy of it we can find

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
over here in the haystack string on the left, and there is some "fun" hidden in there.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The answer we get back will be the string index of the beginning of the fun, which for us is 2.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You may be wondering why this is 2 and not some other value like, say, 7.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Remember that Python strings--and, in fact, almost all Python collections start counting at zero.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The "m" is at position zero, the "i" is at position 1, and the "f" is at position 2,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and that's where the fun starts.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Toshiro Mifune is a Japanese actor, and one of his most famous roles is the bandit in Rashamon.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Well, we found the fun, so snap, the rest of the job's a game.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's see a few more examples of this.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We want to find a space in "Hello world," and there's one right here--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
position 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Our final answer is 5.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You can also find a starting position.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Here, if we're trying to find 1 in "1 + 1 = 2," the first occurrence can be found at position 0,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but if we only start around position 2, then the answer we get will be 4.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If the needle you're looking for does occur in your big base string

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Python returns negative 1, which is out of range for the string, to indicate as much.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Let's review and test your knowledge of string.find with a quiz.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In this class, quizzes are for your benefit. They check your understanding.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They don't count for your grade in any way.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They are not meant to be stressful, and you can try them as many times

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
as you like until you get the right answer.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Here I've written two Python expressions-- "Ada Lovelace" dot find space.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Let's say we're trying to break this up into words.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And "Alan Turing" dot find "n" starting at 4.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'd like you to fill in each blank with the answer we would get from the Python interpreter.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You can use Python if you'd like to get a better feel for how this is going to turn out,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
but you can also just try to solve it on your own

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.820
by thinking hard about the structure of the problem.
