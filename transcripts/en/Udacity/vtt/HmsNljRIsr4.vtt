At an elementary school, there are a lot of students for which Spanish is their

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:09.513
first language. Now let's say there are two ways of teaching English to them.

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:14.335
One way is to only teach them in English. Another way is to teach them in both

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:19.283
English and Spanish. So researchers randomly assigned students to one of these

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:24.844
two groups. One student were assigned to either being taught in English only or

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:29.989
in both Spanish and English, it stayed that way. After a while, the researchers

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.036
gave each student a reading comprehension test. On the day of testing for the

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:40.105
English only group, the temperature was 72 degrees Fahrenheit. But for the

00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:45.870
bilingual group the temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which is pretty hot.

00:00:45.987 --> 00:00:51.365
When the scores were calculated, the English only group had an average of 70%,

00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:54.815
while the bilingual group had an average of 55%.
