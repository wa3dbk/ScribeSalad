Did you get x equals 1 or x equals 4? If so, well done. Let's see how we got

00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:09.025
these answers. We know when we're solving absolute value equations that we have

00:00:09.037 --> 00:00:13.530
to split it into two cases. We have the case when 2x minus 5 is positive, when

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:17.865
it will equal 3. And we also have the case when 2x minus 5 is negative 3. So

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:22.400
we're going to solve each one of these equations independently. When we add 5 to

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:27.552
both sides of the equation here we get 2x equals 8. Which means x equals 4 when

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:33.024
we divide both sides by 2 and when we solve this equation add 5 to both sides I

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:38.328
get 2x equals 2 and when I divide both sides by 2 I get x equals 1. x equals 1

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.968
and x equals 4 are the solutions to this first absolute practice problem. let's

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.853
try a few more.
