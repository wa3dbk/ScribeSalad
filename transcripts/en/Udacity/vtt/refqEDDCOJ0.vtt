00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.351
So now that we understand what factors
were multiplied together to create this

00:00:04.363 --> 00:00:08.949
term, is there a more simplified way for
us to write this? Thankfully the answer is

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:13.364
yes. However before we can start to play
around with this term, we need to learn

00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:17.823
about something called the commutative
property. Specifically the commutative

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:23.460
property of multiplication, since all of
our factors are multiplied together here.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.927
The commutative property of multiplication
basically tells us that it doesn't matter

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.461
what order you multiply things together
in. So, for example we know that 2 times 3 =

00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:43.150
6. However, we also know that 3 times 2 = 6.
That means we know that 2 times 3 is just equal to 3

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:49.429
times 2. If you want to talk about this with
variables instead of with numbers we could

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:55.820
talk about, let's say, x times z times y. Here we
have three different variables multiplied

00:00:55.832 --> 00:01:01.763
together and we can rearrange these
factors in any order we want and still get

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:09.770
a mathematically equivalant expression. So
we could have, a ton of different things

00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:17.474
maybe z times x times y. That's also equal to y times x times z
or z times y times x, and so on and so forth. All

00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:25.180
these expressions and all the other ones
that we could get, by rearranging these in

00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:29.776
other ways are equal to one another. So
remember for multiplication, it doesn't

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:34.372
matter what order you multiply things
together in. This holds no matter how many

00:01:34.384 --> 00:01:39.220
things you want to multiply together, and
it holds whether the factors are variables

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:39.837
or numbers.
