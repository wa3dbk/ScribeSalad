00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.340
When working together, we use the general formula 1 over a plus 1 over b equals

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.203
1 over x. This is one job completed in a hours plus one job completed in b

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:15.910
hours equals 1 divided by x. The total time it takes for two things, or people

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.725
to complete that job together. But not everything has to work together.

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:24.257
Sometimes things can work against each other. So, what new equation do you

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:27.460
think we could write here and use to help us problem solve?
