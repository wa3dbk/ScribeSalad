00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What can happen to a startup?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, the best thing that could happen to a startup is that it can grow into a company

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and hopefully a large company after you found a repeatable and scalable business model.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Or 2 is well you can still pivoting and iterating as you continue to search for a business model.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Or 3 is you could have found a business model but may be one that isn't an explosive growth,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but you could be growing slowly and barely breaking even.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Or 4 is maybe you never found the business model but you can make money

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and you run out of money in time and you shut your company down.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The answer is all of the above.
