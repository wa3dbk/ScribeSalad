00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.333
So, let's start out what we know first. We know what we want to test. So, I'll

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.322
go into the plot tester and I'll create a new plot of the size that we did the

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:11.530
example for. And then, I'll print out the actual which should be the number of

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.610
fields, if the radius is 400. And then, I'll print out the expected number that

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.468
we calculated, which was 8. Now, to actually do the calculation, first thing I

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:23.735
do is calculate the number of rows, which should be an int. And the way that we

00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:27.310
did that was to calculate the length minus the diameter, divided by the radius

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.394
times the square root of 3. But that wasn't counting the first row, so I've

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:35.010
gotta add the first row back. And since there are some doubles in here, I won't

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.590
automatically get integer division. So, to drop the fractional part, I'll need

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.454
to actually cast this. Now, I haven't actually defined diameter. But that's

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:46.580
just twice the radius. After that, I calculated the number of odd rows. Which

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.136
was the total number of rows, plus one, divided by two. And the number of even

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:54.808
rows, was just n rows over two. The number of columns in each odd row, was

00:00:54.808 --> 00:00:59.018
based on the width and the diameter. I want to make sure that I actually get an

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:03.347
int here. So, I notice that the width is an int and the diameter is also an

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:08.435
int. So, that's good. The column is an even row was the width, but we couldn't

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:13.122
use that first space at the left. So, we have to subtract off one radius before

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:17.988
we divide to see how many diameters fit across. And then, the total number of

00:01:17.988 --> 00:01:22.191
fields is the odd rows times the number of columns per odd row. And then, the

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.519
number of even rows times the number of columns per even row and this number of

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:30.471
fields is what we wanted to return. Let's find all my typos, oh got lucky that

00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:33.865
time. Let's see if the plot tester agrees, look's like it at least works for

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:38.350
the example we checked. That's a good sign. That was a pretty tricky problem.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.620
If you struggled, way to stick with it.
