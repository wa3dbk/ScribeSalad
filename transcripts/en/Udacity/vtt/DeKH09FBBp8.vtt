00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.930
Here are two word clouds of traits that you and your fellow

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.760
students submitted as either better or worse. Now, I want you to

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.640
take a moment to look at both word clouds and see if

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.700
you find any traits that you disagree with being in that category.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.039
&gt;&gt; The idea that some traits are good or bad

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.010
is really subjective and can be very sensitive for some

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.440
people if they have a trait that others consider bad.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.340
So I want you to be respectful as we go through

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.440
our course and hear from different people with many different kinds of

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.000
traits and remember to show that same respect to your fellow classmates.
