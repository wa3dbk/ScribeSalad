00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.990
Everything we've done so far, has
been to set up the rules of the game.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.090
We define the network, and
the notion of a flow over it.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.360
And we've justified some of
the simplifications that we've made.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.340
Now we're going to turn to the task
of actually finding a maximum flow.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.088
The search will be an incremental one.

00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:19.360
We'll start with a sub-optimum flow,
and then we'll look for

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.485
a way to increase it.

00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:23.710
&gt;&gt; Supposed that we are given
a particular flow over a network, and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.870
we want to explore how
we might change it.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.490
Perhaps we realize that
we can increase the flow,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.509
by routing it through this link here,
instead of through these two.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.780
And that would then allow us to
add more flow, through this path.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.669
This is equivalent to adding
a flow that goes like this.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.900
Notice that the flows through
the middle, cancel out.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.660
By adding this flow to the original,
I get the desired result.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.800
Alternatively, if we just wanted to
reroute the flow through the top link,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.180
we could add a circular flow like this,
which would then reroute the flow.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.240
In fact, all possible changes that
we might make to our original flow,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.700
can be characterized as another flow,
but different rules apply.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.640
Certainly, if we've used up some
of the capacity on an edge,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.100
we can't use the full capacity
in the flow we're going to add.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.150
We capture the rules for
the flow that we are allowed to add,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
with the notion of
a residual flow network.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.550
We start by defining the residual
capacity, for all pairs of vertices.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.162
Let's consider a u,v edge.

00:01:26.162 --> 00:01:31.310
If u,v is an edge in the original graph,
then the residual capacity

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.430
is the original capacity, minus whatever
flow we already sent across that edge.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.810
For reverse edges, where not u,v but
v,u is the edge in the graph,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.090
then we have a capacity equal to
the flow that we sent from v to u.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.200
We can unsend this much flow.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.090
Everywhere else,
the residual capacity is zero.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.410
In the residual graph,
the edges are those u,v pairs for

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.660
which the capacity is positive.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.140
Keeping the network sparse,
helps in the analysis.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.570
In this example here, notice how
the direction of this edge is reversed.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.477
There's no residual capacity
going forwards anymore.

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:13.995
That's all the new stuff.

00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:16.685
But there is a residual
capacity going backwards,

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:20.375
since we can unsend the unit
of flow that we sent up here.

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:22.725
This edge here remains the same.

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:25.285
We can still send 1 unit
of flow along there.

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:28.722
This edge in the middle
gets interesting,

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:32.192
because we can either
send 1 unit of flow,

00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:36.632
that would still leave us inside of
these capacity constraints here.

00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:39.722
Or we can unsend the unit of
flow that we already sent.
