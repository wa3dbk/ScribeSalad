00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here again, we do have our remove html markup function

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
with the parentheses already in.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here is the input that doesn't work properly.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Note the usage of a backslash in order to escape the single quote,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which otherwise would be seen as a

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
delimiter around that string.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can print this out to see whether it contains the right value,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and you see it has the don't in here exactly as in our example.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In order to address this issue,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we need to record which quote character we actually had

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and which we need to check for again.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For this we need to change these lines in here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What we're going to is, we are going to use the quote variable

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to store the quote character, you see?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now quote is either false

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or it contains a double quote or a single quote,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and this makes it impressibly true.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now this does only work when the quote variable is false,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and this is how we start a quoted string.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
When we see that very quote again,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we set quote to false,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and this is what should now finally fix

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the problem in this html input.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then we press run.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And now the single quote and the double quote is properly handled,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and what we get is just the text without the html markup.
