00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.272
The key to solving problems like
this is to figure out how does

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:08.125
the address breakdown into offset,
index and tag this.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:13.153
Conflicts will occur, where different
blocks have the same index bits.

00:00:13.153 --> 00:00:17.541
In this particular cash,
256 byte block size.

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:22.359
Means that there are 8
bits to the block of set.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.860
In hex, conveniently,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.860
that means that the least significant
two digits are the offset and

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.014
we can safely ignore those,
because they are not apart of the index.

00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:35.067
Now we need to figure out how
many bits are in the index.

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:39.084
We have 16 kilobytes and
256 byte blocks.

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:43.791
The number of blocks in the cache
is this divided by this and

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:46.009
that gives us 64 blocks.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.586
64 is 2 to the 6th.

00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:52.824
So we need the next 6 bits here
to tell us what the index is.

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:56.538
The 6 bits will be contained
in the next 2 hex digits.

00:00:56.538 --> 00:01:01.852
So for 56 hex, we can write
it out as binary, this is 5,

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:07.150
this is 6 and
we are interested in these bits here.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.332
So we're really looking for, which
blocks of these have the same bits here.

00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:15.628
Those that have 56, definitely
we'll have the same index bits.

00:01:15.628 --> 00:01:19.564
So we will definitely have
a conflict here and here possibly.

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:21.928
But in order to actually
have a conflict,

00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:23.825
it needs to be a different block.

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.975
This address here does not
conflict with this one here,

00:01:26.975 --> 00:01:29.464
because they're actually the same block.

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.275
They have the same block number.

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:32.703
So this is not a conflict.

00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:35.214
They don't have the same
place in the cache, but

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:39.025
they're actually the same block, so
it's not a conflict among blocks.

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:43.952
This, however is a different block
number that definitely maps to the same

00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:45.995
index, so this is a conflict.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:51.798
55 looks like this, these are the 6
bits, they're not the same.

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:57.384
So this block will not
conflict with the one here.

00:01:57.384 --> 00:02:01.343
Finally, 16 looks like this.

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:04.306
These are the bits that we're
interested in and they do,

00:02:04.306 --> 00:02:06.232
indeed match the ones of this block.

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:10.508
So this goes to the same place
in the cache as this and

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:17.480
it's a different block, because
this is 123416 and this is 123456.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.850
So this will also
conflict with our block.
