We're really fortunate to have our language abilities. Because of language,

00:00:03.584 --> 00:00:07.816
humans are able to think and discuss abstract ideas. This is different from

00:00:07.816 --> 00:00:12.330
other animals who communicate with each other. But they can only do so by

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.894
signaling other members of their species about immediate situations, such as

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:21.460
being hungry, hurt, or ready to reproduce. Such as using mating dances or

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.742
mating songs from birds. As we saw in lesson three, humans have evolved and our

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:30.593
brains grown larger, and as a result, we've been able to develop language. Our

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:35.557
ancestors, homo neanderthalensis, had a very primitive language, which we call

00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:41.067
a protolanguage. So protolanguage is a rudimentary language, also known as

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:46.841
pre-language, and it was used by earlier species of homo. Now as we evolved our

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:51.566
brain size increased. So did our ability to develop and use language. Both

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:55.854
psychologists and anthropologists have suggested, that the complexity of the

00:00:55.854 --> 00:01:01.402
brain and our ability to use language coevolved, which makes sense. With this

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:05.178
increase in brain size We would be able to think and communicate more complex

00:01:05.178 --> 00:01:10.610
and abstract ideas. Furthermore, as the size of social groups increased, so did

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.984
our need to be able to communicate effectively with others. Our ability to

00:01:14.984 --> 00:01:19.340
communicate allowed us to form communities. To hunt together, protect each

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.590
other, and even develop the ability to cultivate land.
