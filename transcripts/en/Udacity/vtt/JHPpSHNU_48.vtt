00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is it could reveal all three of their nonces

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and show that they compute the correct xi value.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Assuming the encryption function has the properties it should, it should be difficult to find

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
r0, r1, and r2 values that encrypt in the same way with a different vote.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Note that this requires the property of the encryption function

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that it's hard to do this by cheating by finding a different vote

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with different nonce values that encrypt to the same thing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is actually a required property of encryption.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
As long as the encryption is invertible, this would be impossible.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If we could find two such values, well then we couldn't decrypt

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and get the same x or y out correctly that went in.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's why this works--if we're willing to reveal these values and show that they produce xi

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that proves that someone somewhere along the chain cheated

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
if the vote is not recorded in the final tally.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The big drawback of this is it requires that the voter reveals her vote

00:00:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in order to show that her vote was not included in the tally.
