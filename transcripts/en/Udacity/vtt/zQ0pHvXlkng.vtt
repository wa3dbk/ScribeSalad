00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.558
Here are our final answers. Great work if you got those correct. This cube root

00:00:04.558 --> 00:00:07.418
and this 5th root might have been tricky, so if you struggled with them, that's

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:12.541
okay. For the first one, we split 32 into 2 times 16. The square root of 16

00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:16.132
equals 4, and the square root of x squared is x, and the square root of y

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:20.726
squared is y. This leaves us with a 2 in the radical, which gives us our final

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:27.260
result. For the second one, we want to split up 75 into 3 times 25. The square

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.266
root of 25 equals 5, and then we leave the 3 inside of the square root since

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:36.800
it's not a perfect square. Next, we use our idea of power divided by root. We

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.914
have a square root, so we want to take this power and divide it by 2, 3 divided

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:45.140
by 2 equals 1 with a remainder of 1. So, one a will be on the outside, and one

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.100
a will be on the inside. For b, we'll have 8 divided by 2 which is 4, so e to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.628
the 4. And finally, for c, we'll have c squared since c to the 4th divided by 2

00:00:55.628 --> 00:01:01.350
equals c squared. This is our final result. For the next problem, we rewrite a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.160
as 2 cubed. We know that cube root of 2 cubed is just 2 since that this factor

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.610
appears three times. Now we us power divided by route to simplify each of these

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.955
variables. 5 divided by 3 is 1 remainder 2. For c, 4 divided by 3 equals 1

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:21.870
remainder 1. And for d, we have 6 divided by 3 which equals d squared, and no

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.289
d's inside the radicals since the remainder is 0. And finally, for our last

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.652
one, we can't take the 5th root of 36, since we don't have a factor that

00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:36.100
appears 5 times. Nothing simplifies. But for our variable factors, we can

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.734
simplify 10 divided by 5 equals 2. So, we'll have w squared, with no w's inside

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:46.800
our radical, since the remainder is 0. For x, we'll have 6 divided by 5 which

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.654
equals 1 remained 1. And for y, we'll have 12 divided 5 which equals 2

00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:56.213
remainder 2. Here's our final answer.
