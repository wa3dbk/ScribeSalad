00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.990
Next, we prove that
this reduction works.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.039
Let f be a 3CNF formula with
n variables and m clauses.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.190
And we'll let A and
k be the result of the transformation.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.960
First, we show that if f is satisfiable,
then there's a subset of A summing to k.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.270
Let t be the satisfying assignment.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.280
Then we include yi in our set S,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.300
if xi is true under the truth
assignment, and we include zi otherwise.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.120
As for the g and h families,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.790
if fewer than three literals of
a clause are satisfied, then include g.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.310
If fewer than 2, then include h as well.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.830
In total, the sum of these
numbers must be equal to k.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.120
In the other direction, we argue that
if there is a subset of A summing to k,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.410
then there's a satisfying assignment.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.010
Suppose that S is a subset
of A summing to k.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.080
Then the impossibility of
carrying the digits in any sum

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.170
implies that exactly one of yi or
zi must have been set to true.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.500
Therefore, we can define a truth
assignment, t where t of xi is true

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.580
if yi is included, and
it's false otherwise.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.600
This must satisfy every clause,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.830
otherwise there would be no way that the
total in the clause places could be 3.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.670
All together,
we've seen that subset-Si, is an NP.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.400
And we can reduce 3-CNFSAT,
an NP-complete problem to it.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.690
So Subset-Sum must be NP-complete.
