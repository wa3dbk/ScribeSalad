00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.500
Here's the answer. I've just modified the code in the finally block and we added

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.874
a new try around it. So, now we're going to, instead of just doing fout.close,

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:13.210
we're going to try fout.close. If it fails, we're going to catch all exceptions

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.565
and we'll do nothing, that's what pass does. So, now if fout is not defined,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.981
well there's no file to close, that will raise an exception, but we can ignore

00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:24.519
that. Otherwise, it'll close the file.
