F minus g of 2 equals 5, and f minus g of x equals negative x squared plus 3 x

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:12.156
plus 3. Great thinking if you found these two. To find f minus g of 2, we

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:16.892
really just want to subtract the two outputs when the input for both functions

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:23.020
is 2. So we just want to subtract the output of g when x equals 2 from the

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.630
output of f, when x equals 2. We remember from before that f of 2 equals 8.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.390
This is the number we get when we plug x equals 2 here. And we can recall that

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.408
g of 2 equals 3. This is the output for this function when x equals 2. So we

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:48.440
really just want to subtract 3 from 8. So 8 minus 3 equals positive 5. And then

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.820
to find this function we're going to take g of x and subtract it from f of x.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.756
So I've f of x first, which is 3 x plus 2, I'll write that here. Now I'm

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:06.109
going to subtract this entire function g of x. That function is x squared minus

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:12.119
1. So distributing this in negative 1, we'll have 3 x plus 2 minus x squared

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.352
plus 1. Remember that this negative sign will change the sign of both of these

00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:23.310
terms. Then we just add the like terms together to get this new function.
