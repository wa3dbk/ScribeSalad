00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.310
Structured analysis and design techniques are functionally oriented.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.990
They concentrate on the computations that need to be made.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.940
The data upon which the functions operate are secondary to

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.120
the functions themselves. Object Oriented Analysis and

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.570
Design on the other hand is primarily concerned with the data objects.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.000
These are defined first in terms of their attributes and data types.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.710
Later the functions are defined and associated with a specific objects.
