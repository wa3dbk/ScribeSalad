00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.576
Here's the answer. What we need to do is have three parameters in addition to

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:07.772
the self object. So we have the name parameter already. We need owner and chef.

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:14.744
And now we're just going to initialize attributes to those values. And the names

00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:21.452
happen to match here. There's no reason they need to. That's just for[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:25.547
and probably it's actually a better idea to make them not match sometimes I use

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:29.390
the convention of using p in front of the name to indicate that, that's the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.996
parameter. So then we would have the p here for those names, distinguishing them

00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:39.000
from the attribute names that are part of the object. As long as you pick names

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.240
that are clear, they can be whatever you want.[SOUND] Now when we initialize a

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.576
restaurant we need to pass in three values,[SOUND] and we can see that all those

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:54.653
attributes are defined in the object.
