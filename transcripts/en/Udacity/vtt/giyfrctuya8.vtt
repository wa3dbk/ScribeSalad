00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.780
So, here I am in the storyboard, and

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.970
the first thing I want to do is add a button somewhere here in my app.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.310
The way to do this, is to look in the utility area.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.010
In here at the bottom, is this button called show the object library.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.610
I'm going to click on it, and now I have access to a whole bunch of different

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.250
user interface elements, things like a button, a slider, and many others.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.400
Now, I can look at them, in this list format, or

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.950
I can click on this little button here, and see the icon view.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.820
There it is, I can even search for things I want like, a button in this case.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.920
And there's the element I want.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.990
So I'm going to drag this button, on to the editor.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.740
And use these blue lines, as a guide for

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.590
dropping it in to the center of the canvas.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.880
There, I can change the text of this button to let's say, record.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.050
I can also change the width and the height of this button.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.770
There.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.690
Now, one good practice here,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.560
is to go to the editor menu at the top and click on size to fit content.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.349
This way the button will automatically change its size, as you type in it.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.030
There.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.990
Let me drag this in the center one more time.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.790
Done. Now, once you've selected the button, I want you to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.730
click on this tiny little icon here, which is called the Attributes Inspector.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.700
If you click on it, it will present to you a whole bunch of different options

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.260
that can help you change the, well the attributes of the button.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.500
You can change the text here, the font here, and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.962
a whole bunch of different options that we will tinker with soon.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:36.650
All right, so for now, what I want to do,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.880
is I want to run my app and see if this button even shows up on the app.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.140
The way to do this, is to use something called a simulator,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.600
which is our way to run the app, without needing a hardware device.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.460
At the top here, you will notice a list of simulators that are available.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.710
I'm going to use iPhone 5s and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.740
that's because, this simulator fits really well on my recording screen.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.110
You could have used iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 plus for that matter.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.120
Then I'm going to click on this play button, to run the app.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.199
Notice that the simulator may take a while to load up.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.330
When you run it for the first time.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.720
All right, so there's our simulator.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.630
And there's the button inside the simulator.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.450
Although it's not quite in the center yet, and that is somewhat bothersome but

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.350
I will fix that in the next video.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.430
For now, I can click on it, and nothing happens because we

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.090
haven't programmed the button to do anything just yet.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.870
As a quick aside, you can do to the window menu here at the top, and change

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.660
the scale, to make sure that the phone fits really well on your computer screen.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.100
This is a little bit too big for me.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.970
So, I am going to keep the scale at 50%.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.470
There.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.570
Also, if you go to the Hardware menu at the top, you can rotate your phone left.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.150
You can rotate it right and you can go to the home screen.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.890
There is our app.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.560
Pitch perfect.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.290
All right.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.320
So, the next thing I am going to do, is I'm going to fix this button, so

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.860
it shows up in the center of the phone.
