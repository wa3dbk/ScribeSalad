That does it for
protocols and extensions.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.230
These skills are really going to come in
handy as you get deeper into building

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.850
apps with UIkit.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.090
Next up,
our last lesson is all about closures.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.730
Closures are serious business,
a real challenge for

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.260
every iOS developer
the first time around.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.370
So rest up and

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.660
get ready to learn an entirely
new approach to using functions.
