00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.370
To get started, we really want to be
able to construct models of data, and

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.260
then validate those models against some
metrics for success, or goodness of fit.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.840
And so to do that, we're going to
go to Udacity's own data analyst

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.360
nano degree program, where they do
many of the same things with data.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.310
They construct models of data,
they compare those models against one

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.410
another, and they validate those
models against some external metrics.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.550
You're going to cover some basic
statistics and basic data analysis and

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.670
some directory to machine learning
materials from that nano degree program.
