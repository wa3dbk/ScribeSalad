00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.940
Now, addition and subtraction work really 
similarly.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.020
Here, I've given you two functions. 
We have f of x equals 2x cubed minus 2x squared.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.993
And g of x equals x cubed plus x squared. 
Now, for these two functions, can you

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:19.000
tell me what we get if we add f of x to g 
of x?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.110
And then secondly, what happens if we 
say, f of x minus g of x.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.149
Make sure that you simplify your answers 
as much as possible.
