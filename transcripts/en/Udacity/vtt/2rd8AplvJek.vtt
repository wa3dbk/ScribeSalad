00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.620
With a bank account balance, the total makes perfect sense. The balance can be

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.297
added to when you deposit money, and it gets smaller when you withdraw money.

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:13.738
It's just a number that gets incremented and decremented in times. With friends

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:18.067
in a social network, I probably wouldn't be using this pattern. Because in a

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:21.895
social network, you don't just con, collect the number of friends that someone

00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:26.862
has, you want to collect the actual friends. And that would not be a variable

00:00:26.862 --> 00:00:31.818
that gets incremented or decremented. A car odometer? That again makes sense.

00:00:31.818 --> 00:00:38.911
As miles accumulate, this not total just gets bigger. Notice that this one here

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:44.568
doesn't get smaller. that's fine. And finally, what were flag stripes. I don't

00:00:44.568 --> 00:00:50.408
know, it's, a flag has a constant number of stripes, they don't change. So,

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:54.698
even though you may want to count the stripes, it's not the total pattern where

00:00:54.698 --> 00:01:00.600
you have a quantity that has some method that adds to it. And maybe some method

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.425
that subtracts from it. The point is that, once you've seen a couple of classes

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:09.614
that keep a total of gas consumed, of miles driven, of money in the bank,

00:01:09.614 --> 00:01:15.640
whatever. Then you start recognizing that particular pattern, and it becomes

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.240
easy for you to put in a method that adds something to the total that takes

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.473
something away. So, let's look at a few other patterns that you haven't seen so

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:29.621
much, but they are very useful in practice.
