00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
Now, the question of course is should you try to solve P versus NP?

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.109
There's a web page called the P versus NP page

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.790
and that page lists a lot of re-attempts that have been made to settle the P versus NP question.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.060
The list which you find on this web page as you can see is very, very, very long.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.220
The list contains almost a hundred papers, of which when I checked that the last time,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.050
41 claimed that P equals NP and 46 claimed that P does not equal NP.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.349
So, we already know that half of these proofs are wrong,

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.799
but of course, none of them is accepted in any way.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.750
None of them has ever been published in a scientific journal so we can almost safely assume

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.429
that proofs not these papers all claim to have do not hold up against scientific scrutiny

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.240
and some of those proofs are actually quite huge.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.430
For example, there was a recent attempt to show that P does not equal NP

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.200
which used up 102 pages which is almost a full Udacity course

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.370
and you know why it didn't work out, a flaw on page 67

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.950
and it is for these reasons that, in fact, many computer scientist

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.340
will nowadays refuse to even look at your proof of P equals NP or P does not equal NP

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.410
unless you can convince them that you have a new insight that hasn't been discussed before.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.060
So, the status of P versus NP is this.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.930
Despite over 40 years of research and a million dollar price

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.990
and many computer science heavyweights having attempted to resolve P versus NP

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.250
so far there've been no solution and that has even been shown

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.290
and unfortunately, we can't go deeper into that,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.510
that some common mathematical tools that are used in theoretical computer science

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.690
are not capable of solving this question.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.570
So, not only do you need to have a good idea for proof,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.050
but you also need to invent new techniques for theoretical computer science.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.950
So, I do not want to discourage you from thinking about P versus NP,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.060
but don't quit your day job to attempt to resolve this question.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.940
So, let's do our final quiz in this unit.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.100
Under what circumstances should you try to settle the P versus NP question?

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.650
Is it when you think who had a brilliant insight.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.350
Is it when you had a brilliant insight and you have made sure that this hasn't been tried before

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.200
Or is it when you have a brilliant insight that you have made sure that no one has tried before

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.720
and you know that your proof technique is actually capable of settling the P versus NP question

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.270
Or is it when you are a seasoned and respected computer scientist with nothing to lose

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.570
and enough money or savings to sustain yourself

00:02:31.570 --> 99:59:59.000
So, please check all of the correct ones.
