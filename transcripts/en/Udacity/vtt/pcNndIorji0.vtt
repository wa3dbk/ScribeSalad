Hi.
My name is Dwayne Lessner.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.170
I'm a Technical Marketing Engineer
at Nutanix.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.040
And here with me-
&gt;&gt; I'm Karl Krueger.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.689
I'm a Course Developer here at Udacity.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.750
Welcome to our course
on Intro to DevOps.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.410
&gt;&gt; We'll take you through what
makes up the principles of DevOps,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.330
explain how to apply
them where you work, and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.870
showcase some tools that can
help you along your journey.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.120
&gt;&gt; We'll start out by talking about
what DevOps is, where it came from, and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.070
what problems it's trying to solve.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.580
&gt;&gt; We'll dive into what makes dev and
ops people tick.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.170
How to understand the other side,
gain some empathy.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.950
And how they are motivated to get
to the end goal of creating better

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.790
work flows to save you time, and
to keep you from pulling your hair out.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.040
&gt;&gt; And we'll talk about some tools for
those work flows.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.510
Deployment, automation, and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.040
monitoring tools that can really change
your working environment for the better.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.120
Throughout we'll sprinkle
in some examples.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.860
We'll also take a look on how we can
measure the benefit of dev ops in use.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.960
&gt;&gt; So with that let's get into it.
