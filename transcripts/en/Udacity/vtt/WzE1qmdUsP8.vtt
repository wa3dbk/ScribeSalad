00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.120
&gt;&gt; So, let's recap lesson one. Our task, was to learn what

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.520
is user experience? And the steps we followed were, we defined user

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.910
experience and we gave you a super-awesome example and demonstrated how a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.370
need for speed and portions is a really great example of user-experience.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.610
&gt;&gt; That was my favorite step. Yes. And the second step was we disambiguated

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.472
UI from UX. We talked a little bit about the difference between visual and

00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:29.680
non-visual code. We also gave you two really great

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.150
examples of how to improve your apps user experience today,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.250
with the sign in and check out flow. And we

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.250
also touched on Lowe's wire framing, which is a really

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.985
great technique for starting at the high level and not

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:46.445
focusing on the details to start with. So in Lesson

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.010
two, you're going to learn how to make applications that people

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.170
love to use, by focusing in on your end user.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.910
But before we get into lesson two, you're

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.460
going to watch some interviews from some real users.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and as you're watching these videos

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.360
of real users actually interact with applications, make

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.240
a note of what makes them unhappy, and

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.020
what makes them happy, in, in these applications.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.680
&gt;&gt; And also make a mental note of whether the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.990
things they mention are related to visual or non-visual code.
