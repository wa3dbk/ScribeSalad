00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.230
Light mapping is a way of lighting objects to make them look highly realistic,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.124
or for that matter highly stylized. For static objects in particular, those

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:10.114
that aren't moving, the idea is to pre-compute shadows, reflected light, and

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:14.345
any other lighting effects desired. For example, you can see in this scene that

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:18.520
the smaller cube has a subtle realistic shadow effect on the larger one. This

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.146
type of effect is difficult to compute at interactive rates. This is how the

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:26.100
process works. First, here's a scene without any lighting applied. Every

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.820
surface is assigned an additional texture called a light map. This extra

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.410
texture will be used to capture the light's effect. Some offline process is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.213
done to the illumination in the scene. As much time as desired, can then be

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:41.078
spent determining how much light reaches each pixel on each surface. The

00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:45.090
results are stored in the light map. The light map is a mosaic texture, holding

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.260
many different surfaces' illumination calculations. For example, the lower left

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.545
corner of this light map is for the ground plane. You can see the two shadows

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:56.213
of the cubes laying on it. When the objects are displayed, the fragment shader

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:59.381
takes the object's color texture and multiplies it by the corresponding light

00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:04.269
map texture. This gives the surface an illuminated look. Here's the final

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.792
result. Note that it's the same or darker than the original image without

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:11.472
illumination. This is why light maps are sometimes half jokingly called dark

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:15.011
maps, since they lessen the overall light. In theory you could bake the

00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:18.001
lighting into each color texture itself instead of using a separate light map

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:23.245
texture. While possible, this can quickly get expensive. One major advantage of

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:26.035
light maps is that they can have a much lower resolution than the texture on

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:28.780
the surface itself, and can be stored in a single color channel instead of

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.649
three. Rather than storing six high resolution textures per cube in this scene,

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.785
each with the lighting baked in, just one texture and six small light maps are

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.040
stored for each.
