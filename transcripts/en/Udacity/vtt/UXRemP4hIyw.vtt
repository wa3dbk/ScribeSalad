00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.880
So one thing, if you remember back to what we did when we

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.040
needed to update our map that we forgot to do with the buttons,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.470
was make sure that we properly update any elements that are no longer active.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.220
I say active, in this sense, to mean any buttons that don't correspond to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.580
the current year, and any countries that don't correspond to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.140
the current year of the World Cup that we're looking at, and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.480
any circles that don't correspond to the current year we're looking at.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.390
For our map, we did this update through the exit selection.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.200
We filtered our data for the year of interest, we removed elements from our

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.590
exit selection and we added elements from our enter selection.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.660
For the buttons, for the sake of simplicity, we can make all the buttons change

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.851
to their initial state and then selectively change the one button we need.
