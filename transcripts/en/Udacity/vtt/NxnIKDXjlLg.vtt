00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, the first one is in some sense the identity transformation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're not actually doing any work here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For everything in 1, 2, 3, just put that in the output.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That will totally work.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here we're going to take 0, 1, 2, but we're going to add 1 to each,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so 0 + 1 is 1, 1 + 1 is 2, 2 + 1 is 3.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That will give us the output we expect.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here we're going to do the reverse and subtract.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This will be -1, 0, 1.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That's not what we were hoping for.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Here we're going to divide a bit. 3 divided by 2 is 1.5.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's kind of close, but 6 divided by 2 is 3.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is not getting us the answer we want in the right order.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And finally, over here, length of a is 1.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
My is 2 and the is 3, so we get the answers we expect.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Here I've written those answers out explicitly in Python in the interpreter,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we're just going to check and see that we got the answers that we expected.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. That's good.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This was much too low.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here the division didn't work out properly, but in the last one it worked out fine.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We could totally fix this last one.

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If we divide by 3 instead, we will get 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, but it was off by 1.
