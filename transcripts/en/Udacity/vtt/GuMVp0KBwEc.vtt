Hi, my name is Steven Jones, and I'm one of the senior engineers in the CUDA group at Nvidia.

00:00:06.108 --> 00:00:09.380
My job is to work on what we think about the CUDA programming model.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.815
I have to figure out what we should and shouldn't do to add to it,

00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:14.684
how it should look once we actually do decide to add something,

00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:19.062
and of course getting the actual engineering work done under the covers to support the new stuff that we add.

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:23.848
And one of the things I've worked on most recently is what I'm here to tell you about right now.

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:26.160
It's something we call dynamic parallelism.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.430
So, in essence, it's really simple.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.632
Everything you've learned so far about running programs on the GPU

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:36.940
has followed sort of a code processor model where the GPU is fully under control of the CPU.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.281
If you think about it, the CPU can create threads for itself. It cannot work on the GPU like this.

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.651
Or it can synchronize to wait for the GPU work to finish.

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:53.230
It sounds pretty simple, but this extra little arrow allows all sorts of new types of problems to be solved on the GPU,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.922
and I'm going to tell you about some of those.
