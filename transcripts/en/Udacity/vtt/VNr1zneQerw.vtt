If you've been on the internet for a few years you've probably noticed that

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.250
some websites look or act differently on different browsers.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.910
And trying to open a modern website on an older browser sometimes yields

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.330
a buggy experience.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.430
Obviously as web developers we want to ensure that our users have

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.050
the same awesome experience regardless of their browsers or operating systems.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.300
This has been a problem since the beginning of the web and

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.760
there are solutions available to manage cross-browser compatibility.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.470
If you search for

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.119
CSS resetting or CSS normalize, you'll run into this style sheet, normalize.css.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.730
Let's take a look at it.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.780
This will help ensure that your CSS styles are interpreted the same

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.040
across all browsers.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.210
To take advantage of CSS resetting, simply link to the CSS style you see here,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.100
like so, and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.010
you can be confident that your styles will work the same across all browsers.
