00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.980
An operating system has to feel external events. For example, external

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.630
interrupts that may come in when a process is executing. Or, the process

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.530
itself may incur some exceptions such as a page

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.260
fault. Or it may make system calls. All of these are events that needs to be

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.600
fielded by the operating system and SPIN has

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.880
to support such external events. And SPIN supports such external events

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.270
using an event based communication model. Services can register

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.550
what are called event handlers with the SPIN event dispatcher, and SPIN

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.350
supports several types of mapping. It support a one

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.590
to one mapping between an event and a handler.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.540
It also support one to many mapping between an event and the handlers. And it

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.420
also supports many to one mapping, many events

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.780
being mapped to the same handler. And let's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.990
look at concrete examples to illustrate the power

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.530
of this mapping and how it might help

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.440
in building system services. And what this picture

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.750
is showing you is a typical protocol stack.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.800
And you may have several different interfaces available on

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.160
your machine. And therefore, a network packet may arrive

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.800
through one of several interfaces. Let's say you have

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.350
an Ethernet interface and you have an ATM interface.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.290
A network packet may arrive on the Ethernet port

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.110
or an ATM port. Those are events, and both

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.530
of those may be IP packets, in which case

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.830
there is an IP handler that needs to see

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.630
the events. And so, here is an example of many events mapping to the same

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.980
handler. Ethernet packet arrival is an event, ATM

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.920
packet arrival is an event, different events but

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.230
they map the same handler, which is the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.980
IP handler. That's an example of many-to-one mapping.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.420
The processing of the packet by this IP

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.920
handler results in an IP packet arrival event.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.240
And there will be several clients of the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.080
IP layer of the protocol stack. There will be

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.810
UDP transport, there will be TCP transport, there will

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.090
be an ICMP layer. And they are all sitting

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.450
on top of this IP network layer. So when

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.510
an IP packet arrival event is figured by this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.750
handler, there are multiple clients for that, and this

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.640
is an example of a one to many mapping,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.290
one event, to multiple handlers, that need

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.020
to get triggered. And the SPIN dispatcher allows

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.320
any number of handlers to be registered as

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.200
handling a particular event type. And when that

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.700
even type is reached, then all the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.740
handlers associated with that event type will get

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.980
scheduled by the SPIN dispatcher. The order in

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.995
which they get scheduled is not something that

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:01.190
the designer can count on, because SPIN has

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.580
freedom in the ordering which these event handlers

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.530
may get scheduled when a particular event arise.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.300
But all the handlers that are associated with an

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.620
event will get triggered when that event is

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.090
released. That's an example of one to many mapping.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.700
And finally, here is an example of a one to one mapping. If it's an ICMP packet,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.870
the ICMP handler processes the IP packet, and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.380
if it is an ICMP packet, then it raises

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.120
an event than an ICMP packet has arrived,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.290
and maybe there is only one client for that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.420
particular event, and that may be the ping program, so that's one, two on

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.630
mapping. Even handlers may also be specified with guards of

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.640
finer grain handler execution. For example, this handler could specify

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.190
that only when IP packets arrive it should be executed. So that's a guard that

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.410
the IP packet handler could specify so that even though different

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.830
kinds of packets may arrive on these interfaces, this handler will only get

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.555
triggered when the packet that arrived

00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:09.640
on the different interfaces than IP packet.
