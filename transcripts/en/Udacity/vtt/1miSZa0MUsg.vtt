00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.417
We want to iterate, over every pixel in the image. The first index, in the

00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:08.812
pixels, would be 0. And the last one would the be one, less than, the number of

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:14.306
pixels. Since I only need to affect, every fifth pixel, I'll increment, i, by 5

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:21.398
at a time. To turn a pixel black. I'll use the setColorAt() method, and give it

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:26.236
the number of the pixel I want, and the color to set that pixel to. So now if I

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:31.575
run this, I get the same picture, but dimmed a little. If you look really

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:35.103
closely, on your own screen, it's hard to seen on the video, you can actually

00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:40.586
see the little, black dots. There are probably other ways to do this, but I

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:45.441
think this is the simplest. For example, you could count up by 1 at a time and

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:51.670
then use mod to decide whether to actually color the pixel or not.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.064
Alternatively, instead of checking using mod, you could set the color at 5

00:00:57.064 --> 00:01:03.657
times i. But then, you would need to change the condition for stopping the

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:06.950
loop. I think that would require a little bit more thinking.
