00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.850
So, first things first to get the page we need the generic HTML, so

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.120
let's start with that.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.340
That'll give us a nice shell of the page.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.610
Then, as we're getting that generic HTML, we can fire off requests for

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.340
unique HTML.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.720
We can start to load the page with that generic HTML.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.610
And then finally finish it up with some unique HTML.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.460
The point being here that you can actually separate this generic from

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.120
unique HTML and you can start rendering the page.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.510
You know, rendering favorite cereal, favorite pasta.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.080
Maybe putting up some space for an image.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.160
Even before you start getting the unique HTML for

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.970
things that are specific to me.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.920
This is a really useful technique for

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.010
quickly rendering a page when custom content is involved.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.070
There's almost always going to be some type of generic HTML that

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.910
the browser's going to need.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.260
So, if we return it as fast as possible and

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.140
render it as fast as possible, it'll make our app feel really, really fast.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.730
We can always fire off the request for unique HTML down the road and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.780
then just fill in that data once it arrives.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.880
You'll notice with your Facebook news feed when it first loads you'll

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.540
see some empty stories.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.710
That's Facebook following the technique you see right here.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.800
And the same thing is true for Google searches.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.340
When you search for something, you'll see the header come back before the search

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.430
results start filling in, because this is a really great trick for

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.740
getting content on the screen as fast as possible.
