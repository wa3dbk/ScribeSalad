00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.635
Each organization should determine it's own severity classification, based on

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:09.540
its release and artifact peculiarities and whatever source issue tracking system

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.790
or source control system that they have. Here's one possible schema.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.950
It includes three different levels. The least severe is that minor re,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.100
rework is required. That this rework can be verified by the author.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.970
This would be the case if there were questions about the comments or

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.850
standards conformance, something like that. A somewhat more severe level would

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.640
be where there's conditional rework that it would be verified by the moderator.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.150
And then, for major rework situations, reinspection is required. And here

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.820
a guideline would be that if greater than 20% of the document or 20 hours of

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.070
work or 100 lines of code have been affected then a rereview might be required.
