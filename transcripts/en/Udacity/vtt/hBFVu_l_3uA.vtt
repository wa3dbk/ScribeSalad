00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.171
&gt;&gt; All right. So let's take a look at how this falls out. The drawSprite

00:00:03.171 --> 00:00:06.627
function is given a string representing the name of the loose asset that we'd

00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:10.031
like to draw. In order to draw it on the screen, the first thing we have to do

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:13.606
is iterate through all of the sprite sheets that have already been loaded, and

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:17.249
determine whether or not this sprite name exists on that sprite sheet. Now, to

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.954
make this a little bit easier, we've actually abstracted out and created a new

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:25.233
GetStats object on our spreadsheet. The getStats function will effectively take

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:29.009
in a name, and walk through all of the sprites for the sheet to determine

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.193
whether of not this sprite with that name exists on this sheet. If so, it will

00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:37.560
go ahead and return the sprite information, if not, will return no. Passing it,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.614
the sprite information from the sheet. The sheet itself as well as the position

00:00:41.614 --> 00:00:45.097
x and position y, passing it through. Now drawSpriteInternal is where all the

00:00:45.097 --> 00:00:48.510
magic happens. First we start at the top of it by defining a few sanity checks

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.074
to make sure that someone else in the code base isn't calling this function with

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:56.439
improper data. Next what we do is actually create a nice little variable that

00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:00.660
holds off the center x and center y translation value that we defined when we

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.122
were loading our asset. Next we go to our version of draw image that has all the

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:09.800
fancy perameters. From here, we define the source x, y, width and height values

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.202
passed to us directly from the sprite object that was defined from our json

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:18.555
atlas definition. The next 2 values is the, where we want to draw this sprite to

00:01:18.555 --> 00:01:22.638
on the destination canvas. And that's going to equal to the position x that

00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:26.952
we've been given by the calling function, as well as half x and half y. So that

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:30.846
we can actually put the center of the Sprite, at the location that we're

00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:35.077
interested in drawing in, as opposed to the top-left corner. And, as we said

00:01:35.077 --> 00:01:39.365
before, the destination width and height should be equal to our source width and

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.881
height in the sprite atlas.
