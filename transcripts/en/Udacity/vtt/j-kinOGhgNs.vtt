Now, it's important to note, however, that amphetamine, not methamphetamine, is

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:09.312
used for treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD for

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:14.478
short. This may seem as counter-intuitive. Why would you want to give a

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:18.786
stimulant to a person who has a hyperactivity disorder? Well, amphetamine

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:23.333
actually helps a person concentrate. So, those with ADHD have a hard time

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:27.772
paying attention. For example, in a classroom, and the stimulant, amphetamine,

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:32.840
allows them to concentrate more effectively. Again, it's amphetamine, not

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.143
methamphetamine, that's used for treatment of ADHD.
