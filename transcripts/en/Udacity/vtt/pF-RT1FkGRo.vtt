Now we asked you to read material in the instructors' note section on the

different types of drugs that are used to treat the different types of

00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:12.016
disorders. Now that you've done that, let me ask you this question. If someone

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:16.303
had a panic disorder that was comorbid with major depressive disorder, which of

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:21.705
the following would most likely be prescribed? Do you think it would be a

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:26.395
neuroleptic or antipsychotic such as chloropromazine, a selective serotonin

00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:30.525
reuptake inhibitor such as Prozac, Lithium which is an element that we

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:37.290
discussed, or a stimulant such as the d-amphetamine? Think about it for a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.910
moment and choose one.
