00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.825
x equals 75 is a vertical line. Let's graph it. The condition this imposes for

00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:13.375
every point along it is just that the x value of all of those points has to be

00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:20.075
75. Since y is not included in the equation, this is true for any value of y, or

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:26.364
rather all values of y from negative infinity all the way to infinity. So,

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:32.308
here's our lovely new purple line, just to add some thing new to mix up our

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.361
color scheme, that graphs x equals 75.
