00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi. Welcome back. I'm here with Joshua Bloch.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Josh is a leading textbook author, Effective Java, a book on concurrency in Java,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
a devilish book on Java puzzlers,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and was one of the leaders who brought Java to us

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and worked on the early APIs, including the collections class and so on.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What was that process like?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
[Josh Bloch, Google Engineer:] I as in the right place at the right time,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I have always enjoyed APIs have kind of been the recurrent theme of the past 20 years,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but I used to write them for 10 or 15 people.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
All of a sudden I was writing them for millions of people.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It was chaotic. That's the way the internet was back in those days.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Type systems should exist to serve the programmer and not vice versa.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If you find yourself constantly fighting with the type system,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
writing a program that won't compile, and just spend lots of time jamming the thing

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
through the compiler, and it wears you out.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You don't really gain any insight in the process--

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
then there's something wrong with the type system, and I believe

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that Java's wildcards have that problem.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the case of Java, you've got an existing language that was designed around

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
storing static typing, and if you try to put dynamic stuff into it,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
there's a little bit of an impedance mismatch.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Things that are added to languages after the fact tend not to reside comfortably in the language.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
When languages grow too much and stray too far from their roots,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you generally end up with big messes.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now, we talked about reliability of algorithms.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You did a blog post about a bug in a decades old algorithm on binary search.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What happened there?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
That was a an amazing story.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I was at Carnegie Mellon University for 1982 to 1990 or so,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and when I'd first arrived I took a PhD-level algorithms course from John Bentley,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
who was a brilliant and funny, and he started out by asking us all,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
"How many of you know how to write binary search?" We all raised our hands

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We were hot shot computer scientists.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We got our bachelor's and we felt we knew what we were doing.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
He said, "Okay. Fine. Take out a piece of paper and write it. You've got 10 minutes, and then we'll talk."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Ten minutes later, he said, "Okay. Who got it right?" Everybody raised their hand.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
He picks one person and says, "Put your algorithm on the board."

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The person does, and he tears it apart.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Of course, the person had not gotten it right. It was broken.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The point of his lecture was that you need to use invariants in your code.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
In particular, in binary search the invariants are tricky,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and if you donâ€™t think in terms of invariants, you'll get it wrong.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Language design is always going to be an aesthetic exercise.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You need good taste if you're going to do it, and you're operating partially from the gut.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Empiricism is one important part of what you're doing,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but if something feels wrong or feels ugly then it's probably a bad idea.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
There are some people who are really good at doing the aesthetic stuff

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and at sort of placing themselves in the shoes of the programmer

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and saying, yes, this'll feel right.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Other people can't do that, but they're really good at looking at a grammar and saying,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
"I'm afraid that you're going to end up with an ambiguity here,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
if not now when we add these other features that we intend to add."

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The point is empiricism is great. I would even say it's necessary now, but it's not sufficient.
