00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.890
Now it often happens that when doing something like an exam on

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.830
Tomasulo's Algorithm. We just care, for

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.400
example, like in what cycle something issues or

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.240
in what cycle something finishes, and so on, or how many cycles it took overall.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.250
So let's go to an example that is just trying to track the timing and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.930
not trying to keep track of everything in every structure, and

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.080
so on, just to kind of show you how to do this on exams. So we will have

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.180
the same processor, the same instructions, the same issue, execute write.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.900
But we're going to try to do that without having all of those tables in. So

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.810
let's try to go through this example. Whats going to happen is we kind of need

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.710
to know how many reservation stations we have for each type of instructions. And

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.740
that's the only thing that we're kind of going to be missing a little bit.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.580
So, basically, in the first cycle we know we can issue this and

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.270
nothing else will happen. In the next cycle, we know we can execute this and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.480
then because it takes three cycles. We know that we're going to try to write it

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.680
in cycle 4. So kind of mark this tentatively now for cycle 4. In the next cycle,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.480
we will be issuing this load here. If we consider the same condition that

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.920
the load cannot overlap with another load, then we know that in 2 and 3,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.670
this is going to execute, so that this can begin execution in 4, and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.089
then execute in 5, and try to broadcast in 6. In cycle 3,

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:23.190
we're going to be issuing this. It uses a different unit. So, again,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.010
you have to check basically. In cycle 3, is there an available multiply unit but

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.250
kind of looking at what is currently using the reservation stations? And then,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.265
you have to check for dependencies. So, for example, this is waiting for F2 and

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:39.410
F4. F2 is produced by the second load, so actually this will not be able to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.760
execute until cycle 7. 6 here means that basically we will have 7.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.110
And we can kind of mark here that our F2 comes from instruction 2,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.780
which is why he had to execute only in the cycle that follows its write.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.440
Because this is a multiplication, add 10 cycles to that. We're going to try to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.240
write the result in cycle 17. The subtract is going to issue in

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.870
the very next cycle if there are available reservation stations because, so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.430
far, we have used no add reservation stations that's going to be able to issue.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.310
The subtract is going to wait for 2 and 6, so

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.190
the later of the two loads is really when we can start. So we can

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.670
start in cycle 7. And we will mark here again that, you know, we are waiting.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.170
Kind of just give an indication like what was the delay somewhere. And then,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.020
it's a subtract, so it's going to finish in cycle 8, 7, 8. So it's going to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.360
try to write the result in 9. Next, we're going to consider this divide.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.130
Can it issue in in cycle 5? Well, yes it can because, so far, only

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.830
one unit is used, then we have two such, only one reservation station is using.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.720
We have two of them. So the question is when can it execute? Well, look for

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.194
F0 and F6. F0 comes from the multiply, it's 17. F6 comes at 4,

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:59.228
so we will be able to execute in cycle 18 here because we were waiting for

00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:04.330
F0 like this. And it's a divide, so it's going to try to broadcast at cycle 58.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.515
Next, we're going to consider, what's the next issue cycle. Well,

00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:14.840
6. This add is going to issue in 6 because, again, we have units.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.915
It's going to look for F8 and F2, whichever is the latest. 2 is at 6,

00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:24.194
F8 is at 9, so it's going to start executing in cycle 10,

00:03:24.194 --> 00:03:28.637
execute in cycle 11, try to broadcast in cycle 12. And

00:03:28.637 --> 00:03:34.570
we're going to mark that F8 comes from instruction 4.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.760
And now, because we've been kind of doing this out of order, we have to check

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.900
just are there any two instructions that are actually writing in the same cycle.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.330
If yes then we'll have to redo this. Basically, we have to postpone some of

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.680
the writes in order for that to happen. But because these are all different

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.360
cycles, everything is fine And this concludes our timing example. So, basically,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.010
now we know in which cycle each instruction executes issues and writes. And

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.850
when does this all end without really having to go through all of those things?

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.030
So if we're only worried about timing, then we can do something like this.
