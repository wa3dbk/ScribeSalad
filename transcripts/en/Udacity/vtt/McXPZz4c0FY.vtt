00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's take a look at an approach for actually finding shortest paths in graphs,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and we'll use this example once again.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It will help to actually have names for the other nodes, so I'm going to add these in.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Just remember what breadth-first search does for this graph starting from A.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We mark A as visited and we add it to the open list.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We pull off the open list and add all the neighbors of A to the open list.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Letter C, B, and D then we choose one of these nodes,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's say C and add all its unexpanded neighbors to the graph, but all its neighbors are expanded.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Do the same thing with B. B has F, and D's unexpanded neighbors are E.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, F's unexpanded neighbors are G, and E has no more unexpanded neighbors.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We finish this step for a search.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What we get here is that by the assumptions of breadth-first search,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the shortest path from A to B is this direct link from A to B.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The search would have actually terminated here, but we ran that anyway.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
These are supposedly the shortest paths in terms of number of hops to all these nodes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It actually makes sense. One hop to C. One hop to B. One hop to D. Two hops to F, sure.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Two hops to E, sure. Three hops to G, one, two, three. Yep. There's no faster way to get to G.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This actually does the right thing in terms of number of hops,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but let's take a look at what happen when we went to expand B.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
At this point, even though we have a shortest hop path to B, we don't have a shortest link path to B.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
All we know is that from A, you can reach C in three steps. Well, that's really all we know.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Even this A to D, we don't know, there might be like a half weight path that goes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
from C to D, but we do know that there's going to be no faster way to get to C

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
right because that is the shortest edge out of A.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Any of the longer edges we're assuming we can't take negative weight edges

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that would cause this four to get smaller than the three.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
All we really know is that this three is the smallest.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What we should do is not expand B, but we should focus on C.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We now know that there's a path that actually can get us there in 13.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This 10 edge plus the three that it takes to get to C.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We can get to B faster than 15. We can get to B in 13. Now, is that the shortest possible path for B?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We don't know cause we know that we could get to D in four and maybe there's a link one,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I mean ignoring the graph for a second.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Maybe, there's a link one path that would get us to B, which would be even shorter.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
All we know from what we've done so far is that the shortest path from A to D is four.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Let's lock that down and pull D off of the open list, and let's focus on D.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
D has edges to B, F, and E. Here's B, and here's F and E.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This path to F through D is going to add another seven for a total of 11,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and this path to E through D is going to add another three for a length of seven,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and remember there's also a D to B link, which would add nine to this,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which would get us there in 13, and we already knew how to get there in 13,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
so that doesn't really change anything.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Based on these three, we know the fastest way to A, C, and D,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and once that we have also been able to reach, we know that E has the shortest distance,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which is seven, and there isn't going to be any faster way to get to E cause there aren't any other nodes

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that we could get to and then get to E faster than seven.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We can lock that one down, pull off the open list, add all its edges to the non-completed nodes.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
E can go to F, and it has a link of five.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We could go seven steps to E and then another five to F for a total of 12.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
No, we can already get there in 11. That's probably not a good idea.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
&gt;From E, we can also get to G in one step, which would have been seven plus the additional step

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
for a total of eight, and that's all we can reach from E.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Looking things over, we now know that the fastest way to get to G is eight steps

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
because the only other way we could get to G would be to visit one of the other nodes,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and then go to G, and that would have to be longer than eight.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We're going to lock it down, and now we pull of the open list and look at the edges out of G.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
G can get to F in two steps, and that's an improvement

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because before the best we could get to F was 11 steps.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Now, we can get to F in ten. Can we get anywhere else new?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
No, cause the only nodes that are complete now are B and F, and they're already in the picture,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and in fact, now we see that the fastest way to get to F is going to be in ten steps

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
cause the only other way to get to F that we haven't considered

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is getting there through B, and that's going to be longer.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We can lock this down. Alright! So, let's look at F.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
What edges are coming at F to uncompleted nodes, just this one to B.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
That would have been F is ten steps plus one more would be 11 to get to B.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
That's an improvement over what we had before, and that's it for F.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now, the only node that we've got left to think about is B.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
There's no way to get to be any faster than 11

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
cause there's no other place that we can go and then get to B.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
We can lock it down, and that finishes the picture.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
We now know what the shortest distance is from A to === in the graph.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
The distance to B is 11. Now, we've kind of lost a little bit of information of how we get to B in 11?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But, we'll deal with that in a little bit.
