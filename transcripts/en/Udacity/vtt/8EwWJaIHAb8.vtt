00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.127
No. This equation is not going to cut it. Let's take a peek at the graph to

00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:08.820
compare. This is really interesting. Our equation clearly graphs a parabola, and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.968
we have numbers in every spot in our quadratic formula, so it looks like we

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:17.447
should be able to get some solutions. The question is what kind of solutions are

00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:21.928
they. We can see that the maximum of the graph here is below the X axis. So no

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:26.363
point on this parabola is every going to cross the line Y equals 0. What does it

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:30.664
mean to have a root then? We clearly have some pretty important stuff to talk

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:31.084
about.
