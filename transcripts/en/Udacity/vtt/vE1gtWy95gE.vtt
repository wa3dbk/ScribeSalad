00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.272
All right. Now that quote's explained, why we want to use a more traditional

00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:10.677
object-oriented class base set up, let's go ahead and do that. Now, we'll be

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:16.090
using a piece of code by John Resig that fakes class-based object oriented

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:20.745
programming. Feel free to take a look at the code or the linked blog below to

00:00:20.757 --> 00:00:25.241
see how it works. Now, we're not terribly interested in the internals for our

00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:29.520
purposes. What we care about is how to use it for instantiating the proper

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:34.029
class-based inheritance trees for our game objects. So, let's say we want to

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:39.071
create the following inheritance tree. We want weapon and entity to both inherit

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:43.843
from Class. And we want MachineGun and ChainGun to inherit from Weapon. And

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:48.747
Teleporter and EnergyCanister to inherit from entity. Now we've started this off

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:53.385
for you, but we're going to have you complete this yourself. First, we set

00:00:53.397 --> 00:00:59.053
weapon to be Class.extend. What this means is that weapon extends all of Class's

00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:04.509
functionality, whatever that happens to be, and then adds it's own on top of it.

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:09.969
Similarly, MachineGun is set to weapon.extend, which extends all of weapon's

00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:15.089
functionality, and then builds on top of that. Now, we've created these for you

00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:19.265
for a template. And, what I'd like you to do is fill in the rest of the

00:01:19.277 --> 00:01:21.529
inheritance tree we discussed above.
