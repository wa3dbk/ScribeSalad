00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.400
So for my diagram project, I decided to look at

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.689
the mobile version of reddit.com. And I started by opening

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.420
up the HTML. This is a cleaned up version. Everything

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.470
starts by requesting the HTML. When we receive, we immediately start

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.620
building and parsing the DOM. In the head of the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.230
file, we find this CSS file, compact.css. So we fire off

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.270
a request for it and continue parsing the DOM. In

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.460
the next line down we find this script for Google Analytics

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.750
but it's marked async so it's not part of

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.530
the critical rendering path and we can ignore it

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.500
for this exercise. Here we've requesting jQuery, so we

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.690
fire off the request and block the parser. At this

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.250
point the preload scanner kicks in, which looks down

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.869
the HTML for other resources it can start downloading. It

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:46.900
finds reddit-init.js in the header, and it finds another

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.660
script, mobile.js in the body and immediately starts their downloads.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.530
When the CSS arrives, we build the CSSOM,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.930
which unblocks jQuery.js and reddit-init.js, which gets run right

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.530
here. Then, we continue building the DOM. We'll

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.620
then render the last job script file, mobile.js which

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.020
we can actually find down inside the body

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.350
of the script down here, which finally let's us

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.600
render the page. Looking at the metrics of

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.177
the page, this leaves us with five critical resources:

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:21.890
the HTML, the CSS file, and the three Java script files. To find the number

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.050
of critical bytes, we just need to add up the sizes of all of our

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.760
critical resources. Which gives us 99.6 kilobites.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.300
And in the best case scenario, it's going to

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.260
take five round trips to collect all the files that we need for the site.
