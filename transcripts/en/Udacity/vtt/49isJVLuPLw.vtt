course on Prototyping.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.410
In this course we'll be covering te
fundamentals of making prototypes to

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.030
quickly and
effectively make choices about your app.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.750
This is a vital skill for
entrepreneurs, project managers, and

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.060
anyone else who wants to build
an experience that will delight users.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.280
My name is Jay.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.490
I'm a Udacity instructor, and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.950
I'll be guiding you through the
practical application of these skills.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.200
Later parts of the course
