00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.170
The answer is that the blue box should appear inside the red box,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.410
because the context for a function will always be created as

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.430
a child of the context that it was defined within.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.680
A simple way to think about this is that the word foil should be

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.990
allowed to appear inside the body of this function because it's

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.150
a variable from the surrounding context.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.870
It wouldn't make sense if this blue box appeared in the green box,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.990
because that would mean it had no access to the foil variable.
