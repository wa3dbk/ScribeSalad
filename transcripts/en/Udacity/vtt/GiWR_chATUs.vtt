00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.670
To code the unconnected function,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.120
we used functions of
the location request object.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.860
First of these was setInterval.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.210
Now, this sets the desired interval for

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.250
active location updates measured
as a period in milliseconds.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.110
So right now, if it's set for
a thousand milliseconds,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.970
that means it will check
the location once every second.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.320
That's pretty fast.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.860
So, if you wanted to change that
to be less frequent, for example,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.230
once every ten seconds,
you could just change this to 10,000.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.450
Remember, it's always
measured in milliseconds.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.470
Then we use set priority.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.780
This is used to set the priority of
the call, as it's name might suggest.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.710
The priority is a strong
hint to the location client

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.790
about which location
services it should use.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.820
There are many factors about which
physical devices it will use,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.310
such as the available
hardware on the phone.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.540
It has four potential values,
so let's take a look at these.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.310
This one that I'm showing,
PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.560
will give you accuracy
to about 100 meters.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.190
It's nicknamed block level accuracy for
obvious reasons.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.405
It's course, and very battery friendly
compared to some of the others.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:18.070
PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY will give
the finest possible location,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.980
based on phone hardware.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.445
But, as you can imagine, this could
impact your battery much more.

00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:28.710
PRIORITY_LOW_POWER will request what
is nicknamed city level activity.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.200
It gives you a range of
about ten kilometers.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.666
It's a very low power
consumption activity.

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:34.867
And finally,

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:41.500
PRIORITY_NO_POWER will request the best
possible accuracy at no power cost.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.490
So if other clients in the app
have gotten a location,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.470
this can actually be
a passive listener to them.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.820
Do note, that if you have set the access
course location in the Android Manifest,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.980
it will override these settings, and
can effectively reduce the frequency of

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.170
location poles,
as well as obvious gating it's accuracy.
