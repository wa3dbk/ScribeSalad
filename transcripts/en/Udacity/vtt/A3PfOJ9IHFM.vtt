What is a freelancer and how can
they help you build your startup?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.060
Freelancers are workers who charge
an hourly or project based rate for

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.100
their skills without being considered
an employee of your company.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.110
There's people with all types of skills
that offer their services as freelancers

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.720
and there's a few basic ideas you should
understand before working with one.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.400
First let's look at some of the benefits
of working with a freelancer.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.140
Freelancers can be great for
your business.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.430
If you don't want to commit to a full
time employee or have a limited and

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.800
temporary need.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.890
For example, maybe you need to use
specialized experience with a technology

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.980
you don't know or

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.410
need to complete a series of small tasks
that would take too long to do yourself.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.090
If you have any of
these requirements for

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.490
your business this could be an excellent
opportunity to work with a freelancer.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.220
While there are benefits to
working with the freelancer.,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.160
it's important to understand
some of the downsides.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.230
First, working with
freelancers can be very tricky.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.380
It's difficult to evaluate
the skills of a freelancer and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.830
because of this it's also risky.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.810
If you don't have recommendations
from people you personally know

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.040
then you need to evaluate the skills of
each freelancer from their portfolio.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.295
Also communication can be a problem.

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:12.980
You'll need to be aware of language
barriers and time zone differences and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.770
be patient with some of
the issues this can cause.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.730
While it can be difficult to find
a freelancer there are some great

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.540
platforms available for
you to make your decisions.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.060
To start try using websites
such as Freelancer, Fiverr, and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.860
UpWork but
there are many other possibilities.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910
The benefits of using these sites is
that they usually have some type of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.310
quality assurance in place for
their workers.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.860
There's also often more than one person
on the team to help minimize the risk

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.250
that your project won't be completed.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.870
And most of your communication
will be done through writing so

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.290
be careful that you're clear and

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.140
concise about what you need from
any freelancer you're working with.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.180
Freelancers provide an amazing
opportunity to get the skills you need

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.580
for your business.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.010
Once you get used to the process,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.880
it can really help accelerate
your growth as a company.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.300
Take some time to decide if you think
it's possible to use freelancers to get

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.190
any of the skills you need for
your business.
