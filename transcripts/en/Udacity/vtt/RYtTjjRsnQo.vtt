00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And the answer is 95%, 19 out of the 20 hands have more fingers than the average of 4.95.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So 95% of the people could claim that their number of fingers per hand exceeds the average.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So it's pretty obvious to see that any percentages below 100 can be obtained--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that is making a sequence of which the majority has one number 5 and very well exceptions

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
such as the 4 over here have fewer fingers.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is one in 20 that is 5% but as you draw more 5s,

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you can make the percentage of these occurrences as small as you want.
