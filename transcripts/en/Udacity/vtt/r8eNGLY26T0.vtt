00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.780
Up to now, what we've talked about is

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.100
how to reduce the latency for requiring the lock

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.570
and the contention when the lock is released.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.700
So far we've not talked about fairness. What do

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.040
we mean by fairness? Well, if multiple people

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.650
are waiting for the lock, should we not be

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650
giving the lock to the guy that made the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.640
lock request or tried to acquire the lock first.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.280
Unfortunately, in Spinlock, there is no way to distinguish

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.110
who came first. Because, as soon as the lock

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.700
is released, they are going to try and gab the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.630
lock. And, it's entirely up for grabs, as to,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.105
who may be the winner. So next, we're going to

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:42.330
do is, we going to look at a way by

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.540
which we can, we can ensure fairness in the

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.670
lockout position. Now many shops and restaurants, busy ones,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.890
that is, often use a ticketing system to

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.290
ensure fairness for those who are waiting to get

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.310
served. So for instance, in this example here

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.500
let's say, I walk in the deli shop. And

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.600
my ticket is 25, and I notice that currently they're serving 16. So I know that

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.960
I have to wait for a little bit of time. And you know, once my number comes up,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.170
I can get served. So this is actually, and if I know that there at least nine

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.360
people ahead of me who need to be served before my turn comes up. And by similar

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.430
argument. If people come after me, I know

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.920
that they're not going to served before me. That's the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.120
basic idea that we're going to use in this ticket

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.850
lock algorithm. The ticket lock algorithm is basically implementing

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.980
what I described to you as to what happens in

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.310
a deli shop. The lock data structure has two fields to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.450
it, a next-ticket field, and a now-serving field. And the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.020
lock algorithm, in order to acquire a lock, what I'm going to

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.680
do is I'm going to mark my position. And the way

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.040
I do that is I'm going to get a ticket just like

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.630
when I walk in a deli shop. I get a unique

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.860
ticket, I get a unique ticket by doing a fetch and

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.990
increment on the next ticket field of the log data structure,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.950
and when I do the structure increment, I get a unique number and this number is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.140
also advanced, exactly like how it would happen in a deli shop. And once I have

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.550
my position marked, as to when I can get my

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.860
lock. I can then wait by procrastination.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.870
And what I'm doing here is pausing to see if I've won my. Lock by an

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.700
amount that is proportionate to the difference between my ticket value and who

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.390
is being served currently. And after there's amount of dealing, I'm going to go

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.860
and check if the now serving value equals my ticket value. And if, if it is,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.520
then I'm done, I can return. Otherwise I

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.230
go back to looping. So basically I'm looping, waiting

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.660
for, waiting for my number to be up so that I can assume that I've got the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.100
lock. And how am I going to get, get

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.670
this information that, that my ticket is up for

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.660
serving? That is going to be done with the current

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.430
holder of the lock. He's going to come and release

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.210
the lock, and when he releases the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.360
lock, he's going to increment the now_serving value in

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.428
the lock data structure, and that's all,

00:03:33.428 --> 00:03:37.360
eventually, the now_serving will advance to be equal

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.640
to my_ticket, and I'll get the ticket, and then I can, I can return from

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.420
the acquire lock. Now this algorithm is good,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.840
that it preserves fairness, but you notice that,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.730
everytime the lock is released, there is now

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.300
serving value that is in my local cache is

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.050
going to be updated with a cache coherence

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.170
mechanism, and that's going to cause contention on the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.190
network so On the one hand frener is achieved and on the other hand, we have not

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.220
really completely gotten rid of the contention that can

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.990
happen on the network when the lock is released.
