00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.500
These are the required content provider functions. You

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.270
can implement them any way you like, but

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.130
you'll find that it's really straight forward to

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.530
implement them on top of a SQLite database. The

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.219
parameters packed into our content provider functions match

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.710
the parameters used for Android's SQLite's interface almost

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.570
exactly. The biggest difference is that we replaced

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.810
the table string, with a uri. In the simplest

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.020
content provider implementation, the query is passed

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.840
straight through to the database. Note that

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.720
there are parameters that cannot be easily

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.300
controlled through content providers, such as grouping functionality.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.790
But the interface allows for very flexible querying.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.120
Most importantly, the projection or columns allows for querying

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.945
to be much more efficient. Because the column

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:52.290
indices and our cursor object match the projection that

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.150
we submit to the database, we can just

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.340
get the values by their numerical index instead of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.950
having to use getColumnIndex to look up each

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.420
column index. All right, it's time to code some

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.160
more Sunshine. Let's code a content provider.
