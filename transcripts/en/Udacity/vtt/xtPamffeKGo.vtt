00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
One of the interesting thing about costs is that in the old days costs and revenue,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.910
the minute you started your company, your investors said oh, we know how to track all this.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.020
We want you to fill out an income statement, a balance sheet, and cash flow,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.060
and we want you to do accounting from day 1 which gives us visibility and forecast, etc.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.570
The problem is these were execution metrics.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.770
Existing companies execute known plans.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.900
You could in fact do all the spreadsheets you want for every board meeting,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.470
but in fact they're not worth the paper they're printed on.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.050
But you and your maybe rent-a-CFO or accountant have spent a lot of time.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.650
Now understand that your VCs or investors, if their professionals,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.610
need them for their investors.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.150
But what you really need to be doing is working with your investors and your management team

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.720
is to derive the metrics that matter.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.060
If your investors really want to see income statements, balance sheet, client referral,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.530
great you could give them fantasy documents all they want.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.230
But what your really interested in is trying to understand,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.990
what are the metrics that matter for your business?

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.040
I'll give you some examples.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.050
In value proposition, what was the product cost?

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.240
What was the market size? What share could you take?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.250
What is the competition? What are they charging?

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.920
In customer relationships all the get-keep-grow metrics, some of which we talked about,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.350
some of which you'll discover, what were the customer acquistion costs?

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.930
What were the conversion rates? What was the lifetime value?

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.930
These are key metrics.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.930
This is a lot more important than what is revenue in year 4,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.930
because you're just guessing about that.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
But these are numbers you're going to be living with every day.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.540
By the way, what market type are you in?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.270
If you remember from our earlier lectures, if you're an existing market,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.570
that's a different type of revenue curve than being in a new market.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.620
Do your investors still agree?

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.550
What are your operating costs? What are the basic fixed and variable costs of the business?

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.140
What's the cost of your channel? What's the margin, the channel needs?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.690
How much are you going to have to spend on channel promotion,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.009
shelf space, any other channel extra charges?

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.770
Then again for your revenue stream.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.940
Do you now know with certainty the average selling price, the number of customers per year,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.920
achievable revenue, how long it takes to close a sell?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.950
Here's the number that actually intersects with one of the ones that your investors

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.950
are worrying about all the time.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.880
How much money are you spending per month?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.390
Often called burn rate.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.190
Not only how are you burning per month, but when we just calculate that out,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.930
when will you run out of money?

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.620
All these numbers are ones that you as founders need to have on the top of your head.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.330
No startup has 300 numbers. There's probably somewhere between 5-15 that matter.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.480
Maybe you could be the exception, but you as the founder need to know all these parameters.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.360
In fact the exercises, see if you could go up to a white board and list them.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.090
If you can't, understand that that's your job in searching for the business model.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.300
When you know these numbers, the spreadsheets fall out of these.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.870
But trying to do it ab initio from some guessing spreadsheet just is some fantasy.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.580
You need to get these metrics that matter known, searched, understood, and don't worry,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.100
they will change, but the whole game of the business model canvas and the customer

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.520
development process was for you to find them out firsthand and to experience them,

00:03:40.520 --> 99:59:59.000
not to have them happen to you.
