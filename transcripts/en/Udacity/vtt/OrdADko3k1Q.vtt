00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.059
I just want to recap what we did in this lesson and

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.760
remind you of the iterative process of sketching a visualization.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.540
We started with our bar chart.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.760
Notice that while it does some things well, such as highlight when games were

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.270
not held, it doesn't really convey the trend in time that well.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.710
And also it looks a bit strange since the bars are so

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.980
thin, since they represent only one year.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.290
We then went to a scatter plot, which shows the trend a little bit better,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.890
as we can follow the circles as they rise and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
fall, captures the missing years in which a game was not held.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.390
But not nearly as well as the bar chart.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.000
But is typically used to represent things where the values on

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.370
the x-axis aren't necessarily correlated or ordered.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.950
While the scatter plot has some of the benefits of the bar chart and

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.260
some of the benefits of a line plot, it does a bit of a mediocre job at both.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.630
We then tried to iterate with a line plot, since it is most suited for

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.560
time series data, and conveys trends very well.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.920
Here we can easily see the trend in attendances over the history of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.370
the World Cup, but tends to obscure dates where there was no data or

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.050
a game was not held.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.340
So to remedy this, we're going to add our scatter dots back in

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.540
to show that because of where lower two, there were no World Cups games held.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.780
And then to make the data points, in this case the circles more striking,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.820
we can style them with CSS to make them red.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.830
And to add context, we added a title.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.800
I kept the title in here the whole time through the duration.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120
Since it's usually a good practice.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.670
You start with both a title and labels on your axis.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.040
So that even though the visual display of your data may not be the perfect

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.730
ideal, you or a reader still has the sense of what data you're looking at.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.520
And that concludes the live coding example I wanted to go through.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.240
And hopefully, you have a better sense of the process involved with reaching

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.100
a final graphic.
