00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.660
So for this assignment, discuss how you
might use incremental concept learning

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.660
to design an agent that can solve
Raven's progressive matrices.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.430
What are the concepts that you're
trying to learn in this case?

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.020
What are you incrementing over?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.030
This might depend on
the scope of your problem.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.690
So are you doing concept learning at
the level of the individual problem?

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.418
Or are you doing it between problems?

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:19.193
What concepts are you learning here and

00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:21.297
how are you actually
tweaking them over time?

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:22.573
What would a specific concept look like?

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:24.316
Or what would a general
concept look like?

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.193
Once you establish these concepts,

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:28.681
how will actually help
you solve knew problems?

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.512
Or how are you going to
instantiate them or

00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:33.020
leverage them in new problems
that your agent faces?
