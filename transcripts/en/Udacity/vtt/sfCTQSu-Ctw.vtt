00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.460
The path from the eye to the background is pretty trivial and easily handled.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.292
An empty scene is about the easiest thing to render, so this path is not a

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:10.362
problem. The path from a light to any object to a diffuse object is not well

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:14.931
handled by ray tracing. If you ray trace from the eye to the object, you don't

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.440
know to shoot a ray in this direction. Objects can be reflective, but when the

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.840
light's contribution to a visible surface is computed, only paths directly from

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.272
the light to the surface are checked. So, this answer is indeed true, it's

00:00:27.272 --> 00:00:30.625
ignored. For this third path, imagine you're viewing the world from a point on

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.305
the surface. If you think about it, just about every surrounding visible object

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:38.850
is reflecting light at the surface, not just the light sources in the scene.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.700
Determining which paths could possibly contribute more light is difficult. Any

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.340
paths from the light source are ignored with classical ray tracing as there are

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.064
a huge number of them. So, this case is ignored. The fourth case is easy to

00:00:50.064 --> 00:00:53.225
handle. Even rasterization typically handles lights by giving them a fixed

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:56.790
solid color. And classical ray tracing can treat them in the same way.
