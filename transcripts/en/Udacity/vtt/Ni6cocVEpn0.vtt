00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.030
Given this current state, we can apply means ends analysis veritably.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.100
Now, if we apply means on some of those to this particular state, the number of

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.880
choices here is very large, so I will not go through all of them here.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.560
But I'd like you to write down the number of possible next states. As well as,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.060
how many of those states reduce the difference to the goal? Which is given here.
