00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When we think about the money is it's really a promise from a trusted bank.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If the promise it says if someone brings this money to the bank,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the bank will exchange it for something of real value.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Today, we think of the paper itself as having real value.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But in the early days, what the paper meant was you could go to the bank

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and exchange it for something that everyone would recognize as real value,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
say a bar of gold--almost as valuable as a gold star.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If that's what money means, well then we should be able to do the same thing with cryptography.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's see how that would work.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Alice would go to Indivisible Prime Bank, which everyone knows is very trustworthy,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and she would give to the bank a $100 in some other currency,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
let's assume the bank to take US dollars.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The bank will read the message that says, "The bank owes the bearer of this note $100."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The bank will send Alice a signed version of that message.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The message, along with its signature, which is signed by the bank using the bank's private key,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
signing a hash of that message.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This signature proves that it is a valid IOU from this bank,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and now Alice has something representing currency.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now Alice could spend the currency. She could buy some tacos from Bob's Taco Emporium.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Give him the currency. Pretty expensive tacos.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And Bob could take the note--this signed message from the bank--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and give it to the bank and ask the bank to deposit into his account.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now the question is how well would the scheme that I've described work?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Let's assume that everyone in the universe trusts Indivisible Primes

00:01:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and knows that bank's public key.
