00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.367
We know that the solutions to these two inequalities will each be intervals of

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:08.529
values of x. Which if we think about these graphs is going to correspond to

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:13.114
selecting certain portions of each of these curves. The points that lie in those

00:00:13.114 --> 00:00:17.875
regions that are selected will have x coordinates that satisfy The corresponding

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:22.420
inequality. So for each of these inequalities, I'd like to tell you whether

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.893
solutions can be found above the purple line in either graph, or below it, or

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.984
maybe both or it maybe neither, you pick. You pick.
