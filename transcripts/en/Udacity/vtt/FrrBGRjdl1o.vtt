00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.170
So here are some of the issues that arise when we

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.700
try to accomplish the first step in OOA.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.582
As Jared mentioned, some of the words are duplicated.

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:13.290
You know, we'll try to condense those and

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.630
just have one copy of each of the words.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.949
Some words share the same stem, for example, pile and piles.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.630
And some words are, are close to each other and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.210
really share the same underlying concept like leaf and leaves.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.070
And in these cases we're going to do what's called stemming.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.690
Stemming removes the prefixes and the post fixes, the suffixes to the words,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.620
and just uses the root word as the corresponding candidate and class.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.860
That leaves us with a question that you, you, you indicated both counter and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.380
count, okay?

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.990
In this case, we're going to use our kind of discretion and say, let's for the,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.580
the moment treat those as separate classes, even though by getting rid of the,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.100
the suffix on counter, we get the same word as count.
