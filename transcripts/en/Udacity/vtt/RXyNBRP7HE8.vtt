00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So what we're going to do the rest of this unit is look at 3 particular protocols.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're going to look at the encrypted key exchange protocol,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we're going to look at SSH for setting up a secure shell,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we'll look at TLS, which is the most widely used cryptographic protocol today.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's the protocol that's used every time someone connects to a secure website

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
using HTTPS.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
All these have some things in common.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
They all have the goal of authenticating a client and a server.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This could be in either direction or in both directions.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It could be to allow a client to know that they're talking to the right server.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It could be to allow a server to know that they're talking to the right client.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It could be to mutually authenticate both parties.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And they all involve a mix of asymmetric and symmetric techniques.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What I hope you get from seeing the 3 different protocols

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is a sense of some of the things that are the same--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that there are techniques that all the protocols have in common at some level,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but there are also differences between the protocols,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the things that led to those decisions and why the protocols have different properties.

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We'll start by talking about encrypted key exchange.
