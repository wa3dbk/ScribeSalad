00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In order to solve this problem, you need to have a good understanding

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of what the original function, proc, does.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So let's take the two cases that really embody the output of this function.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There are 2 inputs, but the output only depends on the value of A.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Specifically, the value of the function test on a.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If test(a) is true, then we return the second parameter b.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If test(a) is false, we return the first parameter a.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's what we need to check in each of these functions. Let's start looking at them.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In proc1, if test(x), which is the first parameter is true we return y.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This matches with the original function.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If test of the fist parameter is true, we return the second, as we do in proc1.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If test of the first parameter is false, we return that parameter x.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Test x is false, which is equivalent to test a is false,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and in both cases we return a and x,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which are just different names for the same variable in this function.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is equivalent.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's look at this second function--proc2.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Notice here that this condition is based on the value of b.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We know this can't possibly be equivalent to proc, our original function,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
because the output here is not dependent on the value of b.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We can tell right away that this is false. This is not equivalent to our original function.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's look at proc3.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The structure here is a little different, but let's work our way through it both examples.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In the event that test(a) is true, we set result to b and re-return result.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
As our original function did, if test(a) is true, we return b.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If test(a) is false, we simply return result, which was set at the beginning to a.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So the overall functionality is that if test(a) is true, we return a.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This matches with our original function definition.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So this is equivalent to proc.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now we have the last function--proc4.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It might throw you off that you see 'udacity' in quotes here, which is not present

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in any other function, but it's important we work our way through the problem.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If test(a) is true, then not test(a) is false.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We return b.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If test(a) is true, we return b.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That matches with the original definition.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If test(a) is false, not test(a) is true,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so we set b to 'udacity,' but then we return a.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
If test(a) is false, we change the value of b,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but we don't do anything with it--we just return a.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The result is the same as our original function proc.
