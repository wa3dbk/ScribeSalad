00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.154
The answer, of course, is simply the number of elements in the stencil,right?

00:00:03.154 --> 00:00:08.475
So every element in that array is going to be read 5 times by the 2D von Neumann stencil

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.017
because there are 5 entries in the neighborhood.

00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:17.002
So, all elements will be read 5 times by the 2D von Neumann stencil,

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:22.460
9 times by the 2D Moore stencil, and seven times by the 3D von Neumann stencil.
