00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.469
In our last question, student OmniBeef asks,

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.250
"This might be a strange question, but I will ask it anyway.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.250
What do you guys expect from us?

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.180
I love the idea of Udacity, and I am sure I am not the only one.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.380
How can we help Udacity grow and be successful?"

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.780
&gt;&gt;Wow, that's not a strange question at all.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.820
We love the question. We love that students are helping out, making the course grow.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.990
The things that I have been seeing a lot of--

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.890
and I hope people will continue to do--

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.160
definitely try and encourage your friends to take a class.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.030
We still have time to enroll more students in the class--

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.800
it's great to have as many students as possible.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
There's also a lot that you are contributing by posting in the forums,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.440
by either answering questions or asking questions.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.910
That will enhance the quality of the class for everyone.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.780
Also, if you can produce creative, extra materials.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.650
We've seen some examples of that already.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.920
That's something that will definitely enhance the class for everyone

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.000
and we'll certainly appreciate any efforts to do that.
