00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.950
What we just saw with the category-partition method, is a

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.530
specific instance of this systematic

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.230
functional testing approach. So specific instance

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.900
of the steps that we represented here. And, as I

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.100
mentioned earlier on, this is not the only way in which

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.700
you can generate test cases, starting from a functional specification.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.190
In particular, this step, in which we identified relevant inputs and

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.390
then we combine them to generate test case specifications, can also

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.490
be done in different ways. And, we're going to look at one

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.170
of these ways. Which is through the construction of a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.040
model. And, the reason why I want to talk about models.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.090
Is because, model based testing is also, fairly popular in

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.680
industry. And fairly used in practice. In model based testing, the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.150
way in which we go from specifications, to test cases,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.220
is through the construction of a model. Where a model is

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.670
an abstract representation of the software under test. Also in

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.860
this case there are many possible models, that we can use.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.180
And what we're going to do, we're going to focus

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.370
on a specific kind of model. And I'll

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.010
just point you to additional sources of information,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.070
in case you're interested in seeing other examples.
