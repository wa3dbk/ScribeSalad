Function A, f of x equals x minus 2 times x minus 1, has two linear factors,

00:00:04.623 --> 00:00:09.551
which we can see right here, two zeros, which we see with these 2 x intercepts,

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:17.818
and is degree 2. Interesting. Function B, which is f of x equals x minus 2

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:23.880
times x minus 1 times x plus 3, has three linear factors, three zeros, and is

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.112
degree 3. Now, please note that, even though I pointed out the x intercepts on

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:32.375
these graphs when we talked about zeroes, if the zeroes were non real, then we

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:37.803
wouldn't see them as x intercepts. But they would still be roots.
