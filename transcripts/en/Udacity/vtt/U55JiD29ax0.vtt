00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.900
By rejecting the null, we know that at least two of the foods differ in terms

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.686
of mean amount consumed. But we don't know which ones differ. We can see that

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:12.813
all three of the means differ from each other, but we don't know if these

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:17.795
differences are due to sampling error. Therefore, we need to do additional

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:22.357
testing to see which means are different. This additional testing is called

00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:26.813
multiple comparison test. So we're able to compare all of the means with each

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:32.900
other. We wouldn't do a multiple comparison test until after we've done ANOVA.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.385
One of the most common multiple comparison tests is called Tukey's HSD, which

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:42.008
stands for Honestly Significant Difference It's named after John Tukey, a very

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:48.450
influential statistician. Tukey's HSD evaluates the significance of the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.100
difference between any two group means. In statistics, we say that this test

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.039
will allow us to make pairwise comparisons. The way we calculate Tukey's HSD is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.410
just like the margin of error that you've learned before. Remember that with

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.910
the z test, it was the z critical value, denoted z star times the standard

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.344
error. And remember with the t test, it was the t critical value times the

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:19.370
standard error. But now when we're comparing three or more samples, we have a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.332
new statistic called Q. And we multiply this by this square root of the mean

00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:30.350
square for within subject varibility divided by n. You might ask how is this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.890
similar to these. Well, the mean square for within subject variability is the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.895
pooled variance. It's just the average square deviation of each value from its

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:46.446
respective group mean. Therefore, the square root is the pooled standard

00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:52.342
deviation. Q is the student highest range statistic, and we find this in yet

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:57.969
another table. It's purpose is to adjust the whole HSD, so that it's less

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.300
likely we commit a type one error. Remember a type one error is when we reject

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.139
the null hypothesis when it's actually true since q increases when there are

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.980
more groups that we're comparing, it makes it less likely to commit a type one

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:19.598
error. Remember that if a sample mean was further away from the population

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:26.383
mean, than the margin of error, it was considered unlikely. Well if two sample

00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:31.531
means are further apart than the Tukey's HSD then that's considered honestly,

00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:34.724
significantly different.
