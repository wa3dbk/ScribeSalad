00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.470
Let us look at the first, the model
base method for adapting our case.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.590
Once again we're in this micro world.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.280
Let us suppose that we
begin from our office, and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.970
we need to go to a restaurant.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.350
Given the problem of going from the
office to the restaurant, let us suppose

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.920
that we retrieve from memory a case
that takes us to a doctor's office,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.630
which is quite close to the restaurant
but not the same as the restaurant.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.750
So one way in which I might be able to
allot this case that I have received

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.310
to address the problem going from
the office to the restaurant,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.780
is to do a search using this model,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.460
this map of the world, which tells me
that to go from the doctor's office to

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.920
the restaurant office,
you can take this particular route.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
So now, I have the earlier case,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.440
which I've adapted,
using some model of the world.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.960
This is an example of using
models In order to adapt cases.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.130
&gt;&gt; So in my programming example earlier,
instead of having a map of the world,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.250
we might have for example an API for
interacting with a particular language.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.855
I've done input from a file in
Python several hundred times, but

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:04.765
I've never done it in Java before.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.265
I know that the overall
process of doing in from Java

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:09.665
is going to be very similar to
the process of doing it in Python.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:14.065
And I have a model of the way Java
works, to know how to actually translate

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:16.960
my case of doing in it in
Python to doing it in Java.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.150
&gt;&gt; Good example David.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.100
It is another one.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.226
This one is from design.

00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:22.486
When we design with
this kind of product,

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:26.557
let's suppose a VLSI circuit for
example, than we not only know something

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:29.982
about the configuration of
the elements in the design, we also

00:01:29.982 --> 00:01:34.310
have a model of how that particular
configuration is supposed to work.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.150
In fact, it might amuse you, David,
that about 25 years back in the 80s,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.920
when I wrote my PhD dissertation, it was
one of the first PhD dissertations that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.410
integrated model-based spacing and
case-based spacing.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.910
That was exactly the idea
in my PhD dissertation.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.300
You used models to be able to adapt,
evaluate, and store cases.
