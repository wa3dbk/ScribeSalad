The over operator shows how we can get a transparent effect by blending 2

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.154
objects. However, there's one little catch. How does the Z buffer work when

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.222
you're using transparent objects. Think about what the Z buffer is dong. It

00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:17.633
stores the depth of the object that is closest to the eye. Say, we draw the blue

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:23.323
far object first, then draw and blend in the red transparent object. This works

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:27.366
fine. The blue object's color is taken and blended with the red fragment that is

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:31.806
drawn. However, if we reverse the draw order, we start to get into problems. We

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:35.949
get the red fragment and want to blend it. But we don't even have the blue

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.257
object in the Z buffer yet. Even if we decide to wait for the blue object, we

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:45.510
get into trouble. When the blue fragment renders, it is considered hidden by the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.183
red filter, since its farther away from the eye.
