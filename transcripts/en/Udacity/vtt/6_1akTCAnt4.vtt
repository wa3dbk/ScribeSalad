00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.150
I want to talk about the two main ways to

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.590
measure a network. Those are called Latency and Bandwidth.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.920
What they mean is very different. They're often confused.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.780
Often people say bandwidth when they mean latency, or

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.180
say latency when they mean bandwidth. They're quite different

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.090
things. So let me explain what they are. So

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.230
latency is the time that it takes for a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.570
message to get from the source to the destination.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.030
And that's for the start of the message. So, we can measure latency by timing

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.810
when you start sending to the time

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.600
that the receiver starts receiving. So this is

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.690
the unit of time. It will be measured in something like seconds. For a fast

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.710
network today, it's more often measured in milliseconds

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.710
and there are 1000 milliseconds in one second.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.590
So now, you understand about latency. And when I

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.860
go back to the Greek signaling network. So, suppose now

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.930
that Zeus, who is all powerful, wanted to send a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.340
message from Rhodes to Sparta. And he thought that the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.600
latency of the smoke signal network as it was

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.500
currently set up was too high, that it takes too

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.730
long for the message that he sends starting from Rhodes

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.390
to reach Sparta. So the question is, how could Zeus,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.090
and remember that in ancient Greece, Zeus was all

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.200
powerful, reduce the latency between Rhodes and Sparta. So

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.750
here are the choices. It makes the signalling nodes

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.410
further apart. So instead of going from Rhodes to

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.400
Naxos to Millios to Sparta, maybe it would have

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.290
to go one hop. There would be a new

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.010
island in the middle here, and it could go

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.520
from Rhodes to the new island and then to Sparta.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.750
He could threaten the soldiers at all the signalling points and

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.170
scare them into working harder, so they start the fires more quickly,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.010
when they need to send a message. He could find a way

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.710
to make it so instead of just sending one color smoke, you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.740
could send different colors smoke. That would mean that with the same

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.550
amount of smoke, you could send more different messages. Or he could

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.010
increase the speed of light. That would mean that the the soldiers

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.320
at each signaling point would see the previous smoke signal more quickly

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.050
than they do now.
