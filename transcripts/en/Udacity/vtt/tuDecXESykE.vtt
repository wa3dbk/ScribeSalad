00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.330
Let's discuss the statistical
approaches in more details.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.910
Statistical approaches use the captured
sensor data as training data,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.050
to build up a model of normal behavior.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.240
The earliest approaches used
univariate models, where each metric,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.380
or measure,
such as a CPU utilization of a program,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.750
was treated as an independent,
random variable.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.370
However, this was to crude to
effectively detect intrusions.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.940
The later approaches
use multivariate models

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.500
to consider the correlations
between the measures.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.510
For example, CPU utilization and

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.920
memory size of the program
are considered together.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.550
Some later approaches also use time
series models to consider the order and

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.850
time we can observe events.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.070
For example,
user logging into a workstation and

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.470
an email from the workstation are two
events that consider in a time order.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.819
The main advantages of
statistical approaches are that

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.350
they are relatively simple,
easy to compute and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.610
they don't have to make a lot of
assumptions about the behavior.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.270
These approaches don't rely on
assumptions about the expected or

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.920
normal behaviors, and
they're simple and efficient.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.350
On the other hand, the effectiveness
of these approaches rely on selecting

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.350
the right set of measures,
which is a very difficult task.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.910
In addition,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.750
they have complex behaviors that are
beyond the capabilities of these models.
