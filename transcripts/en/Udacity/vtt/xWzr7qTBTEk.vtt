00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:03.179
Finally, Sunshine has multiple activities

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.689
and we can move between them 
using InTense.

00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:07.900
We also know how to use Implicit InTense

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.839
to integrate activities from other apps.

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:12.806
In this lesson, we'll dive into
just how the Android framework

00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:14.769
deals with your activities, in particular,

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.420
how the activity life cycle 
maybe different from what you're used to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.355
from other platforms and environments.

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:22.504
Don't worry, there's plenty of code 
for you to write.

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:27.049
Yes. Plenty of code.
Lots and lots, and lots of code.

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:30.507
We'll move Sunshine along,
implementing an underlying database

00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:32.770
and wrapping that in a content provider.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.769
Everything you need to know 
to use persistent storage.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.622
The goal is to ensure your app provides
a seamless, efficient experience

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:43.423
for your users, even when networks
may be slow or unavailable
