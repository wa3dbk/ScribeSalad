00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.560
For example, let's go take a look at the front page

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.180
of our Conference Application. First, let's look at it in Landscape

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.870
Mode on a Tablet, now let's look at it on the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.490
phone. See how the layout is different? Let's take a look on

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.860
this on the Desktop and see how it adjusts, when you

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.500
drag the Window. You can see how the Buttons pop into two

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.890
rows when the window gets too narrow to fit all four

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.380
comfortably, let's take a look at the magic that makes this happen,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.260
it's actually quite simple. The Menu items are laid out

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.230
inside a flex box, and the items inside that flex

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.870
box by default are told to take up 46% of

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.100
the available space. That means, of course, that only two

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.950
items will fit on a line. However, there's an app

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.720
media rule that overrides this if there's a minimum width

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.860
of the window of 500 pixels. In that case, the

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.250
items will each only take up 24% of the space,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.244
so all four items will fit on a single line. Using

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:57.580
Flexbox can be a great way to transform your page. You

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.040
can change flex direction or flex order to make dramatic interface

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.480
changes like the one I did in the Audio Recorder earlier on.
