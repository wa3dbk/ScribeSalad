00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.520
The first thing we're going to do is carve the problem up into four kinds of

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.890
middleware. And the four kinds are going to be based upon the interaction

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.350
mechanisms between the pieces. In particular we'll look at transactional,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.950
middleware because it deals with distributive transactions. We'll look

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.330
at message oriented middleware in which the interactions are messages,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.240
message passing. We'll look at procedural mid, middleware,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.210
which has to do with remote procedure calls. And finally we'll look at object or

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.970
component middleware in which we're making requests on remote objects.
