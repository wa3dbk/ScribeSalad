00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.270
It's an interesting
example of using PCA,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.930
the stuff that we just talked about
on image patches and it's funny.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.100
Like I said, I couldn't show you this
during the tracking part that we did

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.380
because you didn't know about PCA yet,
or

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.640
you certainly didn't know about it from
me and this really wasn't recognition,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.240
but I thought it fit in well here
because now that you understood PCA

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.090
as a low dimensional representation,
we can use that for a lot of things.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.940
So.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.720
Now we get back to recognition.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.050
Actually next time we'll
get back to recognition.
