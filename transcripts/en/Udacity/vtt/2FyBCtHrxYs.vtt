00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.450
Today, we will talk about understanding. Understanding is a very big general

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.350
world. We'll be talking about understanding of even some stories in the world.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.704
Understanding will be very heavily on what we learn about Frames. And it will

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.889
help us set up the infrastructure for learning about common sense reasoning in

00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:24.460
the next lesson. We'll start with talking about thematic role systems,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.780
which are the most structured type of frame representation. Then we'll talk

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.780
about how these roles, these thematic roles can be used to resolve ambiguity in

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.320
understanding the world. Finally, we'll talk about how grammar and

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.580
other constraints can be used to guide our interpretation of the world.
