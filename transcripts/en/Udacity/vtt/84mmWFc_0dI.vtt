00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.420
You just saw how to read from a file and how to find the largest value in a

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.480
data set. The last program prints out the population of the most populous

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.410
country, but it doesn't print the name of the most populous country. Edit the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.190
program so that it prints out the country's name as well as its population at

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.420
the end. And here's a hint, what else do you need to remember? What variables

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.620
should you add so that you can print the population and the country name at the

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.749
end?
