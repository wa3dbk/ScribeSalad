00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.880
I'm Liz Keleher, I'm a program
manager and I work here at Udacity.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.910
I was a classroom teacher for ten years.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.070
And now, since leaving the classroom and
working for ed tech companies for

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.580
about the past five years and
been working side by side with

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.320
programmers in what you might
call tech adjacent roles.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.610
And I still have had that
underlying lack of confidence and

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.360
I feel a little intimidated
to ask questions,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.658
because I'm not sure if I'm
asking the right questions.

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:30.960
And so I've just really felt that
maybe I'm being inefficient by not

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.990
understanding more about the world
of programming, so I really wanted

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.300
to jump in and try to learn, really,
to just be better at what I do.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.270
And also, I'm a business owner, and
I own a couple of writing stores, and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.130
we have a website that I've been able
to just jump in there and use some of

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.122
my new HTML and CSS skills to work
on it, and make it more appealing.

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:56.010
The more you can find out about
the different career options

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.970
there are the better.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.280
We don't work in a world where you have
to pick one path and stick in it for

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.670
the rest of your life, in fact
a lot of things have blurred lines.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.480
But you can also work in places where
you may be one thing on paper but

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.850
you're getting your hands into
a lot of other areas, too.
