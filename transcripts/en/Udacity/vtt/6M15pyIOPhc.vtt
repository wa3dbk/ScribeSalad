00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.746
Let's see if we can use this equation to help us solve a different type of

00:00:02.746 --> 00:00:07.282
problem. Our problem solving method will still be the same. We'll just want to

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:11.450
use a minus sign instead of a plus sign. For this last problem we'll solve it

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.995
using this general equation. Here, we'll have a pool that has a pipe system

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:21.110
that can fill it with water. An inlet pipe can fill the pool in 10 hours time.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.195
While an outlet pipe can drain it in 12 hours. If both pipes are left often by

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:30.480
mistake. How long would it take the pool to fill? Think carefully about where

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.730
each of these numbers should go in your equation, and then solve for the number

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.130
of hours.
