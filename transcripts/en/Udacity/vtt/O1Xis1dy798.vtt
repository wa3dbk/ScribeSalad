00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.917
Anxiety disorders are closely tied to panic disorders. A panic disorder is

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:09.339
defined by frequent panic attacks and pervasive and persistent fear worry and

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:15.410
embarrassment about having panic attacks in the future. So the center of panics

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.382
disorders is the panic attack. Panic attacks involves sudden changes in body

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:25.503
and mind. Panic attacks are characterized by an overwhelming sense of impending

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:30.193
doom, heart palpitations, trembling, sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness,

00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:36.765
intense dread, nausea and even a fear of death. These attacks are associated

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:42.217
with perceptions of threat. It can occur for a number of reasons. For example,

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:46.170
fear of danger, inability to escape, fear of embarrassment or fear of a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.450
specific category of objects. Panic attacks usually last for about ten minutes.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.790
But sometimes can come and go over a period of an hour or more. Due to their

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.090
physiological effects, people undergoing a panic attack may believe they're

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.476
having a heart attack or going crazy. As you can imagine, this can be extremely

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:09.110
frightening. If a person has a panic disorder, there is a preoccupation of

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.241
being worried about having a panic attack. And this puts a person in an anxious

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.958
mood, which increases the likelihood of more worrisome thoughts which can

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:23.784
trigger another panic attack. To receive a diagnosis of panic disorder, a panic

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:27.752
attack must be followed by at least a month of persistent worry over future

00:01:27.752 --> 00:01:31.976
attacks, along with the development of potentially maladaptive behaviors to

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:39.760
avoid attacks. Such as avoidance of putting oneself in an unfamiliar situation.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.432
People with this disorder may tend to disengage themselves from activities that

00:01:43.432 --> 00:01:48.380
they once enjoyed for fear of experiencing panic attacks. For example, some

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.604
people go to the extreme of avoiding being out in public. And that brings us to

00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:58.677
our next disorder. Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a specific phobia involving a

00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:03.986
fear of venturing into public places. Now, it's not that people are actually

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:07.826
afraid of the public places. But rather, they're afraid of having a panic

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:12.271
attack while they're out. In severe cases, people are unable to leave their

00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:18.151
homes. Sometimes for years on end. About 22% of Americans have reported having

00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:23.095
at least one panic attack. But this does not result in diagnosis of a panic

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:27.123
disorder. In addition to having the panic attack, a person also has to

00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:31.835
experience the dread and anxiety about having another Panic attack. For

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:35.299
example, I once had a panic attack. It was terrifying, and all of those

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.038
symptoms felt very real. It was when I was on an airplane one time. But I

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:43.262
haven't ever had a panic attack since that one flight, so just because I had

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:48.256
the one panic attack when I was flying, doesn't mean I have a panic disorder.

00:02:48.256 --> 00:02:52.345
And on top of that it doesn't mean I'm even scared of flying anymore. With all

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:56.570
the diagnostic criteria, it turns out that approximately 3.5% of people will

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:04.320
have a diagnosable panic disorder sometime in their life. And 43% of those

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.363
people who do have a panic disorder will develop agoraphobia. Now, let's go to

00:03:09.363 --> 00:03:11.120
Greg with a little more about phobias.
