00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.980
This is the context in which, typically, a pure

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.310
waterfall process will work well. Why? Well, because it's a

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.160
context in which requirements are usually well understood. The

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.020
domain is well understood, so that kind of system has

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.900
been built many times before. And also, it's a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.510
system in which we don't expect requirements to change dramatically

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.180
over time. Therefore, a waterfall model, in which we collect

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.140
all the requirements at the beginning and then we move

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.280
to the subsequent phases might be the most appropriate one. Probably

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.800
we don't want to do evolutionary prototyping in the case of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.130
the control system for an airplane. Same thing holds for TDD,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.460
so we want to be a little more rigorous in those cases.
