00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.820
Here are our solutions. 
This middle graph shows p plus q.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.055
The far right one shows p minus q. 
And this furthest left one shows q minus p.

00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:14.411
Now, this is quite similar to what we did 
before, except that this time, as we can

00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:19.100
see, both of our original lines have non 
zero slope.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.750
Adding the lines happens pretty much the 
same way as we did it before.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.830
All of these additions and subtractions. 
Cna happen the same way graphically, as

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.970
we dealt with them before. 
It just feels a little bit more

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.299
complicated because our have non zero 
slopes.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.710
Adding the two line, works just as it did 
before.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.365
And we can see that connecting these 
lines gives us, what looks like the

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.250
middle graph. 
Because we're adding different length

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.366
lines to all these different points along 
the graph of q.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:47.280
We're going to end up with a line whose 
slope is different from either p or q.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.430
Now, of course, I could have done this 
the other way around and drawn lines up

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.150
to q and added those to p. 
Either way would give us the same result.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.618
We can see, however, that switching the 
order of subtraction, changes the graphs

00:00:57.618 --> 00:00:58.919
that we get.
