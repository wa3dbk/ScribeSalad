00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.090
Congratulations, you
completed your first lesson.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.820
Now we've covered a lot
of information here.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.080
So let's just take a moment to
reflect on some of the main takeaways.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.380
&gt;&gt; First,
connect your offer to the world.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.360
To do this,
you need to understand your market.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.520
So you can make sure you solve the right
problem to the right audience.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.240
&gt;&gt; And second, I want you to focus on
the most qualitative segment first.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.660
That way you can really show how to
light the fire and make impact quickly.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.760
&gt;&gt; Third, it's good to have competitors.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.790
It shows that someone else agrees
that there is a real need and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.210
real market for your problem.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.090
Just make sure you find
your unique value or

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.280
main competitive advantage you can
differentiate your product with.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.000
&gt;&gt; And finally your value proposition
isn't just a useless exercise.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.380
I can really help you connect
deeply with your product, and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.890
know what's important when you're
pitching it to other people like

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.490
customers and investors.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.080
So we'll see you next
time in lesson two,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.090
when we talk about what to
do when you launch your app.
