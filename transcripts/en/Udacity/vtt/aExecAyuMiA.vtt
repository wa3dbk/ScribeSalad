00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.650
So things that can go wrong when
you're outsourcing your job is

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.660
low quality of work.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.770
It happens a lot of times, you're just
asking someone to do something and

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.800
this is not what I asked for,
or this is in such low quality,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.770
how possibly can you think that I
am going to accept this this job?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.080
Another thing is that they charge
you more money than they should.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.880
They said they worked on
this project for 50 hours,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.470
but you know that in it never
took them more than five hours.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.800
What, seriously?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.310
And they can be not responsive,
they're not answering emails,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.640
they're not answering your
instant messages in time.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.110
The slack world is empty and
basically a lot of the stuff that can

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.360
happen when you remotely work with
employees, it's not that different.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.590
But it's kind of more annoying.
