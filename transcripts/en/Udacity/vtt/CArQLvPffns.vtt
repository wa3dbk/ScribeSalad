00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What the Big Theta allows us to do is basically write complicated functions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in a much simpler way.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We can take a function like ½n² and just think of it as Θ(n²).

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And 8√n we can think of a just Θ(√n).

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Our equation from before, 2n - 2√n just becomes Θ(n).

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's just a linear function asymptotically.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
A complicated expression like this where we have n⁴, which is the term that grows the fastest,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
becomes Θ(n).

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The ln n--in fact, any base log n is Big Theta of any other base log n as long as it's a constant.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I like to think in terms of base 2 logs, because I'm a computer scientist.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That's what we do.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
π² is something that doesn't grow with n, and it ends up being in the set Θ(1).

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's just another constant.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Just to beat this dead horse a little bit longer, let's use the definition of Big Theta

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to show that this expression that we determine for the growth in edges in a grid--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
2n - 2√n--really is just a linear function. It grows like Θ(n).

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The game plan is that we need to find constant c₁ and c₂--bigger than 0

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and a threshold N₀ so that for all the n bigger than n₀, the function that we care about

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is sandwiched between these two scalings.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let's focus on this one first.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What c₂ can we plug in here so that we're guaranteed that this will be above this expression.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If we just copy this inequality down just flipping it around to make it a little easier to think about,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
we want c₂ so that c₂n is bigger than this. Divide through by n

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now we need a c₂ that is bigger than 2 minus something that's actually growing.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Two should work for that.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If we set c₂ to 2, it will satisfy this inequality.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Let's just summarize all that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We can set c₂ = 2. What about c₁?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, let's take c₁ to be 1.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Intuitively, the idea being this function is growing like 2n minus something smaller than that.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So, n should be underneath that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But let's just make show if c₁ is equal to 1, then we need n to be less than or equal

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to this expression. For what values of n is that going to be true?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It's not true of all of them, but it's true for some of them.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We can add 2√n to both sides, subtract n from both sides, and we get that.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If we divide through by √n, we get 2 ≤ n/√n and divided by √n is actually √n.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So, we have 2 ≤ √n.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We square both sides. We have 4 ≤ n, or--flipping that around the other way--

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
if n ≥ 4, then this is true

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That means we have to throw away the smaller values of n,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and we can do that very simply by setting n₀ to 4.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This only has to hold for n that are bigger than n₀.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That's what we've got there.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There we have it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
If we set the constants this way, n₀, c₁, and c₂, then what we find is

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that for big enough n this more complicated expression is sandwiched between

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
two simple linear functions or to say it another way--
