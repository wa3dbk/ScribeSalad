00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So this gives me a great idea! Let's use memoization to make parsing very fast.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's cast our minds back to the glory days of regular expressions and finite state machines.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In order to see if a string was accepted by a finite state machine,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we'd essentially keep our finger on the state.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So on input abb-a, b, b--I just sort of keep my finger on this middle state

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to see where things were going.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If I stop here, then the string is not in the language.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but if I add 1 more character, c--a, b, b, c--I just put my finger on it, and I can tell, we accept.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We're going to use this same "put your finger on it" trick for parsing

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to keep track of where we are, to keep track of which state we're in.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now for finite state machine state, that was pretty easy.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They were the circles.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For our parser state, this is not so clear.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We're also going to solve parsing by "putting our finger on it."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But just like how how nondeterministic finite state machines might require 2 or 3 fingers,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
parsing might also require a number of fingers.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's going to be somewhat complicated.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Consider this simple arithmetic expression grammar--has a starting nonterminal,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but then quickly goes to E.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
E + E, E - E, and 1 and 2 instead of number. Let's just make it finite.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Suppose the entire input is 1 + 2, which is in the language of the grammar.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Currently, we've only seen the 1 and the +.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Remember that to figure out if something was in the language of a finite state machine,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we look at 1 character at a time.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We're going to do pretty much the same thing for parsing.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We're going to look at 1 token at a time.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But the question is, where are we now?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Well, we don't have states that look like circles,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but we do have these rules.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In fact, we've got 5 of them written over here,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and if we've already seen the 1 and the +, we're about to see the 2.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I claim that there are 1 or 2 of these rules that match more closely than others.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
For example, S goes to E--that doesn't seem particularly relevant.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now a minus sign--that doesn't seem particularly relevant.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
E goes to 1--if we've already seen the 1 and the +, we're kind of passed that.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But these 2--E + E and 2--that's kind of where the action is.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That's where we are now in some strong sense.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In fact, I'm going to claim that we're right here.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
In the rules, E goes to E + E, we've already seen the E and the +.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Here's my finger, and we're about to see the next E.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Since I can't always leave my finger on the slide,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
we often formally draw a red dot in the middle of 1 of these rules to keep track of where we are.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This is 1 example of a parsing state.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The first E is going to correspond to or come from the 1 of the input.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Ideally, the second E will match up with 2 in the input.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We've already seen everything to the left of the red dot.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We have not yet seen everything to the right of the red dot.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The red dot is right where we are now.

00:02:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is the past. This is the future. This is now.
