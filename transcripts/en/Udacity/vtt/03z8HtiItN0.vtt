00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.460
It turns out that this answer would be negative 6. Let's see why. You might

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.140
have thought to multiply these together to get the square root of positive 36

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.999
which equals 6. But we know that's not true since 6 is a real number and these

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.458
two are imaginary numbers. The product rule does not hold for imaginary

00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:22.404
numbers. It only holds for real numbers. This was our product rule, and before

00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:26.116
X and Y had to be greater than zero, that was so that we would leave these

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:32.600
radicals for real numbers rather than real numbers. instead of multiplying

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.544
these radicans together, let's simplify each one by using our imaginary number

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:42.300
I. So we'll have 2 I here and 3 I for here. Multiplying, we will get 6 I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.864
squared... We can replace this i squared with its corresponding value negative

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:53.364
1. We substitute that in to get times negative 1 which equals negative 6, our

00:00:53.364 --> 00:00:54.993
answer.
