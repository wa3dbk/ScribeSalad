00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.553
We can understand the ranking that we're going to assign to this hand,

00:00:02.553 --> 00:00:05.833
by the way a Poker player would call out his hand,

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:07.283
when asked to reveal it.

00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:10.280
So our player declares "Straight Flush, Jack high!"

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.811
That's all you have to know about the hand.

00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:15.159
A straight flush, the highest ranking,

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.600
and then the tie-breaker.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.135
All we have to know is that the Jack is the high card.

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.267
So the number 8 stands for straight flush,

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:27.811
and the number 11 stands for Jack,

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.238
and that completely describes the hand.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.547
Here's another hand.

00:00:31.547 --> 00:00:33.911
Let's see what our player would declare for this hand.

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:36.263
"Four Aces, and a Queen kicker!"

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:40.994
So, four Aces is the major rank, which is a 7.

00:00:40.994 --> 00:00:44.073
Ace is card rank number 14,

00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:47.568
and the Queen is card rank number 12.

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:49.479
So that's the complete description of the hand:

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.390
&lt;7, 14, 12&gt;

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.824
Let's do another one. What's this hand?

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:55.369
"Full house, eights over Kings."

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:57.836
So even though a King is higher than the 8,

00:00:57.836 --> 00:01:00.483
The 8 is what counts more importantly,

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.139
because there's three of them.

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:05.269
So a full house is major ranking number 6,

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.793
then the 8 because there's three of them,

00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:10.666
then the King, which is 13.

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.405
That's the remaining card.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.219
That three element tuple completely describes this hand.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.684
Here's another hand. How do we declare this one?

00:01:17.684 --> 00:01:21.186
Our player has called "Flush 10, 8,"

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:23.434
describing the two highest cards in his hand,

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:25.737
because that's usually enough to distinguish the the hand

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:27.921
from all other flushes that might be out there.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:32.003
But in actuality we might need all the hands to break the ties.

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.939
Now a flush is ranked number 5,

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.174
and in order to break the ties,

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:39.332
we look at all the cards in the hand.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.667
Highest first, and working all the way down.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:44.106
So something in there should be able to break the tie.

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:48.665
Although, it certainly is possible, although unlikely,

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:52.322
that somebody else has those five exact cards in another suit,

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:54.303
and it actually would be a tie.

00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:56.052
There would be no tie-breaker.

00:01:56.052 --> 00:01:57.083
Let's look at this hand.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.539
Our player describes "Straight, Jack high."

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.087
That's all he needs to say,

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.389
because if it's a straight,

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.235
if you know Jack is the high card,

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:07.888
then you know the other cards have to be "10, 9, 8, 7."

00:02:07.888 --> 00:02:10.564
So we only need two numbers to describe this.

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:14.527
4 meaning "straight," and then an 11 meaning "Jack."

00:02:14.527 --> 00:02:16.588
Next hand, "Three sevens!"

00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:18.797
Usually that's enough to disambiguate a hand,

00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:21.204
but if we really need to break the ties,

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:24.423
then we would look at the next highest ranking card.

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:26.346
Next is the 5, and then finally the 2.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.268
So to describe the hand,

00:02:28.268 --> 00:02:31.489
we have the rank number, which is 3.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.538
Then the 7's,

00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:36.571
then the complete list of the five cards.

00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:39.972
Next hand "Two pairs, Jacks and Three's!"

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:42.273
That describes most of the hand,

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:44.638
but we also need to compare all the cards,

00:02:44.638 --> 00:02:46.151
including the two pairs,

00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:48.453
but it's the highest ranking pair, first.

00:02:48.453 --> 00:02:52.888
So first, the 2, meaning "two pairs."

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:57.117
Then, the 11 for the Jack (the highest of the two pairs).

00:02:57.117 --> 00:03:00.765
Then, the 3 for the three's.

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:03.100
And now we need the final card.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.555
I happen to have all of the ranks standing around,

00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:10.224
so I use that as a stand-in for the final card.

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:14.184
Either way, that fifth card can completely disambiguate the hands,

00:03:14.184 --> 00:03:16.399
if you happen to tie on the Jack's and the 3's.

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:21.116
Here our player declares "Pair of two's, Jack high."

00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:23.405
That partially describes the hand.

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:25.816
Notice we lost the exclamation point.

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:28.003
He's not so excited about his hand this time.

00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:30.886
So a pair of two's, that's down to ranking number "1."

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:34.150
Then the pair of two's is the first tie-breaker.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.249
And then all of the cards in the hand.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:41.152
Our final hand, and our poor player declares "I got nothing."

00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:42.688
Now he's REALLY crying.

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:45.604
But sometimes nobody else has anything either,

00:03:45.604 --> 00:03:49.252
and then we still have to decide among the players who have nothing, who wins.

00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:52.669
And we just go in order of the ranks of the cards.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.280
So "nothing" is 0.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.545
And then the ranks of the cards

00:03:57.545 --> 00:04:01.000
from highest to lowest.
