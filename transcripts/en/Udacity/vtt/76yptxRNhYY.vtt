We know we can plug any number for x into an exponential function, like 10 to

00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:10.296
the x. So that means that the domain of f is negative infinity to infinity or

00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:15.748
all the real numbers. This also, then, is the range of g. We know that no

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:20.095
matter what number we plug in for x, in 10 to the x, this function cannot reach

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:26.362
0, and also can't drop below 0. So the range of f, goes from 0 to infinity,

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:31.608
none inclusive. This is also the domain of g. This brings up something really

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:37.748
important to know about logs. The input to a log must be greater than 0. It is

00:00:37.748 --> 00:00:41.727
not possible to find the log of a negative number. This is a super important

00:00:41.727 --> 00:00:44.688
point and we definitely need to keep it in mind as we keep working with logs in

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:46.280
the future.
