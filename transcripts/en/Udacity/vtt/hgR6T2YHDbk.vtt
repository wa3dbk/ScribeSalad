00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's one example of a possible solution for our program to create a combination lock.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And this code is based on a code from Amit Gupta.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So we take on a list of nodes. We'll use 6 nodes in this example.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
On the first line, we create an empty graph.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
On the next line, we create a length between zero node and the first node

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and then we have a loop that runs through the rest of the nodes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
On this part of the loop, we make a chain connecting the first node

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with the second node, the second node with the third node,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the third node with the fourth node, and so on.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And on this line, we create the star part connecting zero node with the second node,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
zero node with the third node, the fourth node, etc.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And this is the combination lock we wanted.
