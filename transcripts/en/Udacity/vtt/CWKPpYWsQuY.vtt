00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.600
x squared minus 9 is equal to the quantity x plus 3 times the quantity x minus

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.872
3. We know from looking at the left side of the equation, the original

00:00:08.872 --> 00:00:13.682
expression that we had, that the two numbers we insert here as being added to x,

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:18.530
need to multiply to give us negative 9 and need to add to give us 0. And sure

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.546
enough, 3 times negative 3 equals negative 9, and 3 plus negative 3 or 3 minus 3

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:25.340
equals 0.
