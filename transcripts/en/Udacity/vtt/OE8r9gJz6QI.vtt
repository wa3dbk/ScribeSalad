00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.075
Now we've presented our
DiceViewController in three different

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:08.060
ways; programatically, using
a combination of code and Storyboard,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.970
and entirely in Storyboard.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.130
Recall that in the first solution,
the incoming instance of

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.820
DiceViewController is
manipulated directly.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.330
The current view controller has a chance
to prepare the incoming view controller

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.090
and what did that preparation involve?

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.850
The roll view controller sets the two
dice values on the dice view controller.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.340
When we use a segue the dice view
controller never makes an appearance in

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.340
our code because story board
hides the creation of the object.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.000
So now we need a new hook to allow
communication between the two view

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.740
controllers.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.610
The method we need is
called prepareForSegue.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.840
All view controllers
inherit this method and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.060
it's invoked right before
any segue is performed.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.340
Its entire purpose is to allow
the current view controller to configure

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.270
the incoming object.
