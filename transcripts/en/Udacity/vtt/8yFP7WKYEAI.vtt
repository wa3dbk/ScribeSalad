00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.070
For our first training machine example,
I've chosen one that tests the oddness

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.420
of a binary representation
of a natural number.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.340
Note that I've cheated here
in the transition function

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.760
by including only state symbol
pairs in the domain that we

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.750
would actually encounter
during computation.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.930
By convention,
if no transition is specified for

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.810
the current state symbol pair, then the
program just halts in a reject state.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.960
One convenient way to represent
the transition function by the way,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.560
is with a state diagram.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.610
Similar to what is often used for
a finite automata,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.180
for those familiar with
that model of computation.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.550
Each state gets its own
vertex in a multigraph, and

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.600
every row of the transition
table is represented as an edge.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.440
The edge gets labeled with the remaining
information besides the two states.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.620
That is it gets the symbol
red followed by an arrow,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.840
then the symbol to right, and
the direction to move the head.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.592
Now let's trace through the operation of
this Turing machine on this input 1, 0,

00:01:01.592 --> 00:01:03.050
1, 1.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.741
The head first reads a 1 from the tape,
and run state q0.

00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:10.860
So I go up here and
consult the transition table.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.900
And here,
I see that I should follow this edge,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.544
since that has state q0,
and we read a 1.

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:21.560
And this transition tells me
that I should write a 1 and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.250
leave the tape alone, and
move the head to the right.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.182
And change the state to q0.

00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:30.580
So let's go ahead and update our figure.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.560
We're still in state q0,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.370
and the position of the head has
been moved one space to the right.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.640
So this becomes our new configuration.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.400
In the next step, we'll read a 0,
consulting the transition diagram.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.480
We see that this means that we
should leave the 0 alone and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.486
move the head to the right again,
and stay in state q0.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:55.867
We read a 1 from the tape, and that
means we follow this transition here,

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:58.070
and move the head to the right again.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.950
And the next step is similar.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.400
Finally, the head reads a blank symbol,
the transition table

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.230
tells us to write a blank symbol and
move the head to the left.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.400
And to switch the state to q1.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.290
Now, we read the symbol under the head,
that's a 1,

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.920
so we follow this transition rule here,
and we end up in an accept state.
