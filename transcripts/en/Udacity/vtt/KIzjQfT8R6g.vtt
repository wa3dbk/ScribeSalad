00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.480
You can add color to
your websites using CSS.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.070
However, in order to do this, you first
need to understand how color is encoded.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.446
To start, color is composed of light.

00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:15.020
All light, including the light being
emitted from your screen right now,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.760
is composed of a certain proportion
of red, green, and blue light.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.050
The amount of red, green, and blue light
is what determines the color you see.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.173
For example, the combination of red and

00:00:26.173 --> 00:00:30.056
green light with the absence of blue
light is what makes the color yellow.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:31.521
The combination of green and

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:35.072
blue light with the absence of red
light is what makes the color cyan.

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:37.730
And there are countless
variations in between.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.270
The different combinations of red,
green, and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.120
blue light make up 16,777,216 colors.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.550
That's a lot of colors.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.590
When writing CSS, you express color by
specifying the amount of red, green,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.520
and blue light that should be present.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.640
This can be done in one of two ways.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.450
In the first way, which is commonly
referred to as RGB, each amount of red,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.290
green, and blue light is written as
a decimal number between 0 and 255.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.011
0 being the lowest value or
no presence of light and

00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:14.866
255 being the highest value or
100% presence of the light.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:20.127
For example, if I wanted to change
the background color of this page

00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:26.608
to magenta, then I'd write
background-color: rgb (255, 0, 255).

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:29.431
The first 255 specifies red light.

00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:31.809
The 0 specifies green light.

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:35.090
And the second 255 specifies blue light.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.977
The combination of these
values produces magenta.

00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:42.660
In the second way,
which is called hexadecimal or hex for

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.268
short, each amount of red, green, and

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:50.279
blue light is written as a hexadecimal
number between the values 00 and FF.

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:56.030
00, which is just 0 in decimal, and
FF, which is just 255 in decimal.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.024
If you're unfamiliar with how
hexadecimal works, check below for

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:02.097
some helpful links.

00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:07.956
Using the same example for magenta,
I would instead write background-color,

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:13.656
a pound sign, this tells the browser
I'm using hex code, and then ff00ff.

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:19.499
The first ff, which is really just
255 in decimal, specifies red light.

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:24.294
00, which is just 0 in decimal,
specifies green light.

00:02:24.294 --> 00:02:29.780
And the second ff, which again is 255
in decimal specifies the blue light.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.160
This encoding also produces
the color magenta.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.790
Now colors aren't always as
straightforward as primary and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.320
secondary colors.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.120
Like I said,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.160
there are millions of different
colors you can express using CSS.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.220
Often what can be helpful is using
a color picker to get the exact shade,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.870
tint, and tone for
the color you're trying to use.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.380
You've probably seen a color picker
before if you've ever used a graphics or

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.610
design tool.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.434
But did you know that most browsers
actually come with their own built-in

00:02:59.434 --> 00:03:00.610
color picker?

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.710
Check it out.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.890
Here i have Google Chrome open,
and I'm looking at BBC's website.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.380
If I inspect the navigation bar and
try changing the background color,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.460
you can see that by clicking
on the color square,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.080
I open Google Chrome's color picker.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.320
With the color picker,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.730
I can use the eyedropper to select
another color on the screen.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.130
I can change the hue by
dragging the slider.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.762
I can select a color, and
I can toggle between the hex and

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:29.290
RGB encodings of the color.
