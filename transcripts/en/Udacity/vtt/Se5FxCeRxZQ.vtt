00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.560
That was a whirlwind tour of Kubernetes.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.540
Like Docker, Kubernetes makes
it really easy to run and

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.400
introspect our applications.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.320
That's what I call automation.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.320
This lesson shows you many of
the deployment primitives Kubernetes

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.820
offers Dev's.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.780
At this point, you should be able to
see the power of Kubernetes" higher

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.320
level abstractions which allow you
to focus on your application more so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.400
than managing an employment.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.480
But what if I told you these
were just the basics and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.780
the next lesson we're going to
take off the training wheels and

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.610
learn to not only scale your
application automatically.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.990
But how to perform rolling
updates without downtime.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.420
How to work with sensitive
information and so much more.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.190
See you in the next lesson.
