00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.510
More specifically, the actual OOA technique to apply is the following.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.450
First off, obtain or prepare a textual description of a problem.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.940
Underline in your textual description all the nouns.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.720
Organize the nouns into groups to become candidate classes,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.940
then underline all the adjectives.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.529
Assign the adjectives as attributes of the candidate classes.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.630
Then, underline the verbs, differentiating action verbs from stative verbs.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.020
Assign the action verbs as operations of classes,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.020
and assign the stative verbs as attributes of classes or relationships.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.490
Sounds simple, but we will also see that there are some stumbling blocks along

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.400
the way, which we'll have to apply our own thinking to, to solve appropriately.
