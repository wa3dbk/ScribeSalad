00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.242
Now, not every parabolic equation we encounter will be in vertex form. Here's

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:10.360
another parabolic equation. Notice that we have an x squared term, but we just

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.047
have a single y term. Remember, all parabolic equations either have an x

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:20.627
squared term, or they have a y squared term. They can't have both. Based on

00:00:20.627 --> 00:00:24.990
what you know so far, which way do you think this parabola opens? Does it open

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.314
to the left? To the right? Up? Or down?
