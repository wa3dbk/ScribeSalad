00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
And actually, just this one here is correct.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.470
The other 2 are not correct,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.480
and as I told you, the conditions for a spanning tree are

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.120
first, it can contain no cycles.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.130
and actually here, we have a cycle,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.329
so this can not be a spanning tree.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.040
And over here,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.330
we said that a spanning tree must still keep the whole graph connected,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.560
so all vertices connected to each other,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.900
and this is not the case here,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.890
so here, we have basically split the graph into 2 parts.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.520
Here is 1 part and here is the other part.

00:00:30.520 --> 99:59:59.000
So this is also not a spanning tree.
