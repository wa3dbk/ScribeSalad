Welcome to Intro to Psychology.

00:00:01.732 --> 00:00:02.694
I'm Lauren.

00:00:02.694 --> 00:00:03.586
I'm Susan.

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:04.740
And I'm Greg.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.410
We're your instructors for this course.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.650
We're going to take you
on your journey through psychology.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.620
We'll go over different areas of psychology
and how different psychologists examine

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.580
and explain thought and behavior.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.380
We are all very different.
We like different things.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.870
We think differently.
We even react differently.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.730
So for instance, I have something here

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.762
that might create
different reactions in people.

00:00:28.772 --> 00:00:30.750
Ooh. Look at this guy.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.990
My snake Tickles. I've come to really
enjoy him. He's a nice snake.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.010
I wouldn't mind holding Tickles

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.501
or touching him but I certainly
wouldn't want him as a pet.

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:42.707
Lauren?

00:00:42.707 --> 00:00:44.235
No, no, I don't do snakes.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:45.385
You don't do snakes.

00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:46.495
No. I don't do snakes.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:50.375
The perfect example of how people
react differently to different situations.

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.620
So, there's many different areas
of psychology, for instance,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.840
personality psychologists would look 
at what's going on here

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.620
and try to really understand
the individual differences in the fear

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.935
and why I'm not really afraid, you're
fine and she's more or less terrified.

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:10.260
behavioral Psychologists might look
at an individual's learning history.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.900
So, for example I was exposed to a lot
of snakes when I was growing up.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.760
So, perhaps I've learned that snakes
aren't dangerous for me.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.250
And a Social Psychologist may look
at how other people's behavior

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.040
influences our own. So, for example,
looking at other people's reactions

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.010
may influence our own reactions.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.650
A biological psychologist, perhaps,
may look at Lauren's fright response

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.710
in terms of increase in heart rate,
or even sweating. And a neuroscientist.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.980
They may look at the areas of the brain
that are activated during the fear response,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.510
such as the amygdala.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.610
But for now, I think it's time
for Tickles to head home.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.490
Even though this example exploited
my fear of snakes. Thanks a lot Greg.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.240
It was a really effective tool for Susan

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.750
and Greg to use to show you just
how diverse psychology can be.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.860
Now psychology is defined as a study
of thought and behavior

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.440
and is an amazing way
to make sense of our world
