00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
And there are two correct answers here.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.950
The first one is the simulation takes longer by a polynomial time factor.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.920
Now, it's a bit difficult if you wanted to specify exactly

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.790
how much longer a simulation like this takes.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.120
In my point of view, you would not even take polynomially longer but only a constant factor,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.990
but polynomial is safe enough because in this course we're mostly

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.670
differentiating between polynomial and exponential running time.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
Now, the reason why it only takes polynomial time longer is that, as I said before,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.040
once we're in the certain line of code, this line of code specifies exactly what is going to happen next.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.060
So it's mostly an overhead of simulating what this line here of code does, but as we said

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.960
when we specify the RAM model, each line here is a simple operations, so it takes constant

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.670
amount of time on the RAM.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.410
I think it's fair to say that it will only take polynomially more time if you simulate what it does.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.240
It doesn't do anything really complex. So the second answer here is wrong.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.740
The simulation is also always correct because there's no involvement of randomness

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.420
or guessing and such.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.470
So if the simulator is programmed correctly, we will always get

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.830
the same result that we would have originally gotten.

00:01:08.830 --> 99:59:59.000
It only takes longer time.
