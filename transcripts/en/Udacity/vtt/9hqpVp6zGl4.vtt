00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
So let's take a quick look at where we are so far.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.500
What I first introduced to you is the concept of

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.660
snapshots of the RAM,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.470
so you can look into the machine

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.470
at any point in time that a polynomial time algorithm executes,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.140
and then you see exactly what state the RAM is at that certain point in time,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.990
so which line of the program it's executing

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.400
and also what's in the memory.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.040
I've now also shown you that we can represent

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.940
a snapshot as a Boolean formula.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.390
What that means is that I've shown you how to construct a Boolean formula

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.160
so that when you have a satisfying assignment

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.140
for this Boolean formula and there can be many.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.770
Then you can reconstruct this snapshot from the satisfying assignment.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.660
What we also know is the assignment of the variables

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.960
for the first Boolean formula,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.610
so at time point zero,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.170
and the reason why we know that is that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.460
at the beginning, we know what the machine is doing,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.460
because in the memory there's the input,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.330
the algorithm starts at the first line,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.550
and in the memory where we have the output, and intermediate results,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.190
there's nothing in there,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.340
so here, we already know what the variables are going to be.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.190
Now why are we doing all of this?

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.300
In the end, what we want to show is if we solve SAT for this

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.340
huge Boolean formula that we're building

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.590
and we're not done yet,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.760
if we solve SAT for this formula here,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.920
then we want to know what the machine is actually doing

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.410
or in other words, what we want to get is

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.330
a protocol of what the algorithm here has done.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.310
So each of the Boolean formulas here

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.310
represents a snapshot,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.140
but now we need to ensure that they fit together,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.800
because once the machine starts out in this snapshot,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.360
it will move to the next one,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.140
and so we must make sure that if we have an assignment for the variables here

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.850
that represent a snapshot,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.390
then the snapshot that is represented here must fit together with one,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.560
so that it's kind of a valid representation of what

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.220
the RAM is doing here.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.820
And the way we're going to achieve this is, of course, more Boolean formulas

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.800
so that we add to the game,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.950
and to do that, I would like you to think about

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.780
some statements for a bit

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.580
regarding how snapshots connected to each other.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.540
So what I would like you to tell me is

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.940
which of the following statements is true?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.000
The first one is one a deterministic RAM,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.630
if we know what state that machine is in a time point to,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.270
we can clearly state what the state will be at time t plus 1.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.960
The second one is I want you to tell me if

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.630
this here were true if instead of a deterministic RAM,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.240
we were talking about a non deterministic RAM.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.620
The third one is a non deterministic RAM

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.120
behaves exactly like a deterministic RAM

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.240
except when we use the if&lt;u&gt;better function,&lt;/u&gt;

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.120
and finally, if we use the if&lt;u&gt;better function,&lt;/u&gt;

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.260
there can be any number of next states,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.570
so not 1, not 2, not 3, but

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.470
basically an arbitrarily large number of states,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.760
and we can not make any statement about that.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.550
So which of the following is true?

00:02:42.550 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check all of the boxes where the statements are true.
