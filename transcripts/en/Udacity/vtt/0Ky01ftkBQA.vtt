The fourth section is titled Experimental Conditions. A software design study

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.820
normally means running several versions of a program, making measurements, and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.220
evaluating the results. These programs' executions take place on computers

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.150
configured with resources. Such as their number of cores, the amount of RAM,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.470
their clock speed, and potentially net, the networking that networks them

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.800
together. To support the goal of repeatability, this configuration information

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.010
should be explicitly documented in your report. The fourth section of the design

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.370
study describes the experimental conditions under which the study is conducted.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.960
In particular, it describes the environment of which the study will take place.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.940
This includes elements such as the machines, [COUGH] their models,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.680
operating systems, programming languages any virtual machines and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.527
their versions. Where relevent, the network, the build and

00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:53.258
execution parameters, input files, and confounding factors. Such as

00:00:53.258 --> 00:00:57.460
other users on the machines at the same time or other, processes going on
