00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This change may be hard to think about,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but it's relatively simple to implement.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Our procedure was named "optimize."

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So now, instead of having A be just tree 1

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and B be tree 3,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we're going to call ourselves recursively on our subchildren,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and then, only once they've both been optimized

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
do we check for the pattern.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This will correctly handle A plus 5 times 0.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I may need 1 more return tree at the bottom,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but that was assumed.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So it was as simple as adding 2 recursive calls

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
before we check for the pattern.
