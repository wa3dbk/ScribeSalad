00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.440
Sometimes the most unlikely data can be the most useful and

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.240
lead to savings, due to better planning. For example, a conventional system

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.950
for coordinating logistics might send the closest truck to a factory to

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.300
pick up a package. However, it might be that the closest truck

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.810
is not the best solution. Perhaps there's a traffic jam, or

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.580
the closest route is actually on small roads that take a long

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.390
time. Maybe the truck doesn't have enough free space for the new

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.640
load. So what kind of data would be helpful making a better

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.640
plan that could save money and time for

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.340
the company. Would current GPS data for all trucks

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.260
be useful? Or how about the current plan for each truck for the day? Would it be

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.270
helpful if we had real time information about

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.790
the traffic in the area? How about the current

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.470
load in each truck and its volume and weight.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.670
May be the fuel efficiency of our different vehicles.
