00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.180
Linear programming is largely just the
generalization of this sort of problem

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.870
solving to n dimensions, instead of
just the two that we've seen so far.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.730
We can write our optimization
problem in a form like this one.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.940
In matrix form this becomes
maximize c transpose x

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.400
such that A x is at most b and
x is nonnegative.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.820
Note that inequality,
when applied to matrices,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.720
means that it holds for
each element in the matrix.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.410
When we first encounter a linear
programing optimization problem

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.880
it might not be in this form.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.700
In fact the only requirements for

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.920
an optimization being a linear program
is that both the objective function and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.640
the constraints be linear, whether
they are inequalities or equalities.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.430
If this is true, then we can always
turn it into a canonical form like this.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.070
Here are the key transformations, to
convert a max problem to a min problem,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.879
or vice versa, just negate the vector c,
which contains the coefficients for

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.330
the objective function.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.170
Thus, max c transpose x becomes
minimizing -c transpose x,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.310
and minimizing c transpose x
becomes maximizing -c transpose x.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.330
To convert an upper bound to
a lower bound, or vice versa,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.410
in one of the constraints,
we simply negate the inequality.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.690
We can convert an equality into two
inequalities by giving both an upper and

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.390
lower bound constraint.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.000
Here I have played the trick
from transformation

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.220
to make these both at most constraints.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.210
Things get a little more interesting
when we go from one of the inequalities

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.780
to an equality.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.320
Here, we introduce a new variable,
either a slack or

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.340
a surplus variable,
depending on the inequality.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.500
There's also the problem of

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.390
free variables that
are allowed to be negative.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.060
There are two ways to
cope with one of these.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.160
If it is involved in
an equality constraint,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.420
then we can often simply
eliminate it through substitution.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.770
Otherwise you can replace it with
two new non-negative variables, and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.950
just substitute the difference for
x everywhere.
