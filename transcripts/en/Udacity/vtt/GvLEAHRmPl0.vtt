00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.800
Now that we're at the pixel level, let's talk a bit about Anti-aliasing. By

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.480
default, when we rasterize a scene, we find what's at the center of each pixel.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.580
This can give some fairly bad results, as edges of triangles will either be

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.529
considered to fully cover a pixel, or not cover it at all. The binary nature of

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.250
this process causes what's called Aliasing, giving a ragged look to edges.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.260
Informally, this problem is called the Jaggies or Stairstepping. When you see

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.896
it in animation, it's called the Crawlies. What we'd like to do is get a nice

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:30.886
smooth result, where each edge pixel is shaded proportionately to how much of

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:35.431
it is covered by each object overlapping it. If the pixel is mostly covered by

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:40.404
a triangle, use more of the triangle's color, less, use less. The hard part is

00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:43.380
in figuring out this coverage, it's expensive to compute, store and blend

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.108
triangle areas for each pixel. Though maybe this will happen someday, about the

00:00:48.108 --> 00:00:51.738
same time we get personal jet packs. In the meantime there have been a huge

00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:55.800
number of Anti-aliasing schemes proposed for interactive 3D graphics. On one

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.090
end of the spectrum is Supersampling. Where you simply create a higher

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.570
resolution image, and then use all these extra samples to make the final image.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.706
For example, for 1000 by 1000 pixel image, you might render it at a resolution

00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:11.350
of 4000 by 4000. Now each pixel has 16 pixels associate with it in the high res

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.872
image. Blend these together and you get a better result. This scheme is

00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:21.348
considered a bad idea, for a number of reasons. One is that it's expensive both

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:25.332
in memory and processing cost. Another is that sampling in a little 4 by 4 grid

00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:28.236
is not much help in fixing the jaggies for nearly horizontal or nearly vertical

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:34.000
lines. A scheme commonly supported by the GPU is called Multi-sampling

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.115
Anti-aliasing or MSAA. The idea here is to compute a shade for the whole

00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:42.166
fragment once, and to compute the geometric coverage separately. In addition, a

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:45.046
different sampling pattern than a grid is used, doing so helps narrowly

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:49.449
horizontal and vertical lines considerably. This sampling pattern does vary

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:53.465
depending on the hardware company making the GPU. The main costs here are

00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:56.165
processing and storage, but these costs are considerably less and give

00:01:56.165 --> 00:02:00.870
considerably more bang for the buck than brute force super-sampling. This is

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.118
generally the form of Anti-aliasing used by default by WebGL. I say generally

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:08.702
because there's a toggle for Anti-aliasing on or off, and it's not specified

00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:13.910
what form of Anti-aliasing is used. To turn Anti-aliasing on in 3GS consists of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.602
setting a simple Boolean parameter called antialias. I should note that turning

00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:21.802
this on doesn't necessarily do anything. It depends upon whether the GPU

00:02:21.802 --> 00:02:25.286
supports Anti-aliasing, most should, and whether the browser decides to allow

00:02:25.286 --> 00:02:30.653
it. Sometimes there are bugs that make it safer to keep Anti-aliasing off.

00:02:30.653 --> 00:02:33.662
Sadly most of the video lessons we've made showing 3GS demos do not have

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:38.008
Anti-aliasing on, just because of such a bug. Welcome to the bleeding edge of

00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.704
technology, no one said there would be cake. Another class of algorithms for

00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:44.786
Anti-aliasing perform filtering on the image, this is a relatively new class of

00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:50.678
techniques. The first of these called Morphological Anti-aliasing, or MLAA, was

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:55.040
developed in 2009. The idea is to use the existing image and possibly other

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.050
data to detect sharp edges. When these are found, try to smooth just these

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.750
edges by using nearby pixels. Amazingly, such techniques work pretty well,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.826
though can fail on thin lines, text, and other special cases. One of the most

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:11.712
popular fitting techniques is called FXAA, which just needs the image itself to

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:17.030
operate. I've used it myself in products and it's even included in 3GS. I think

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.080
part of the popularity is the author Timothy Lates put a serious amount of

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.280
effort into both making this shader run on just about every GPU known to human

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.140
kind and thoroughly documenting the code itself. Just to spell it out in case

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.340
you didn't get the hint, please do document your code, especially if you plan

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.440
on having anyone else see it, which of course, anyone can do if you're using

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.049
WebGL or 3GS. So, I'll say it again, document your code.
