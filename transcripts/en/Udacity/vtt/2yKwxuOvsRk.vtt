00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.570
Here the solutions are, negative 23, positive 5 and negative 4x squared minus

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.174
6x plus 5. Excellent thinking, if you got all those correct. For this first

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:16.430
one, we'll start by finding the f of 2. We'll take 2 and plug that in, for x in

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:23.715
the function f. Doing so, we get an output of positive 12. So, when the input

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:30.786
of f is 2, the output is 12. So, we just replace f of 2 with 12. Now we just

00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:36.622
need to find g of 12. We let g's input be 12, so negative 2 times 12 is

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:44.256
negative 24, plus 1 is negative 23. This is how we get our first value. For the

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:49.840
second problem, we want to find g of f of 0. So, we start by finding f of 0.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.313
You let x equals 0 for the function f, and then when we solve this, or simplify

00:00:54.313 --> 00:01:01.123
it, we get negative 2. So, we know f of 0 equals negative 2. So, we just

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:07.104
replace this value with negative 2. So, letting x equal negative 2 for g, we

00:01:07.104 --> 00:01:14.216
get an output of positive 5. This is our second solution. And finally for g of

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:18.548
f of x, we simply take the entire function f of x, and we plug it in as the

00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:26.604
input for g of x. So, wherever we see f of x, will replace that with 2x squared

00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:33.104
plus 3x minus 2, distribute the negative 2 will have negative 4x squared minus

00:01:33.104 --> 00:01:40.810
6x plus 4. And then we'll have plus 1 on the end. Combing these two like terms

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.270
will have our final composite function.
