00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.060
So you're going to want to experiment
with different types of media, so

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.810
it's not just a simple text ad.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.120
Think video, for example.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.050
Video can perform really
well on a social campaign.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.320
Everybody remembers
the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, right?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.450
The Ice Bucket challenge was something
that went absolutely viral and

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.930
generated a ton of money for a charity
organization because it was something

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.830
that felt real and fun, and
it wasn't just a very stale text ad.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.100
I will say, never go into it with
the goal of creating a viral video.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.870
That's a recipe for disaster.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.420
You always want to create something that
you think is a really great piece of

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.215
compelling content.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:40.365
&gt;&gt; So, I think YouTube is
a really cost-effective place for

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:45.395
any small business or startup to
start promoting their business.

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:48.925
I think YouTube is a place
where people go and search and

00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:52.095
try to figure out
are businesses legitimate, and

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:58.450
how do I use this business, or
what is this business all about?

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.410
So YouTube can be a great place where
users will discover your product,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.650
and also where you can quickly
explain your value proposition.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.820
So I've seen really creative
15 to 30 second YouTube

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.940
videos where a business will just
really quickly explain who they are,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.360
maybe even a quick navigation of their
site or app, and then a call to action.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.220
So, let's say you want someone
to just download your app today.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.710
I would explain your value proposition,
what a user needs to know about your

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.260
business, what sets you apart
from any other competitor.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.830
Then maybe showing
the best case scenario.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.110
How a user would use your app.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.320
And make sure the app navigation
is easy and very clear.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.980
Show that on the video.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.430
And then make it clear that the call
to action is download the app today and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.540
start using your product.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.830
So, YouTube is just a great platform for
you to, to explain who you are,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.340
and to do it simply and easily and
really capture an audience.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.070
So once you have that video,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.475
that is just very clear and
who you are and what you can offer.

00:02:17.475 --> 00:02:20.825
Then you can start using
it as an ad format.

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:25.825
So you can use that video to be
placed in YouTube search results

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:29.575
as well as before other videos.

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:34.620
So those are what we call in stream ad
formats or in stream YouTube videos and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.610
that also is an auction, and so it's
very similar in principle in how you set

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.010
up the campaign, but the great thing is,
you can use that captivating

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.460
video as an ad to explain who you are
and capture users followed on YouTube.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.780
So true view is what we call the ad
formats on YouTube that are auction-

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.770
based, so
these are ads that you get decide how

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.900
much you're willing to bid for
a view of your video.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.360
And the great thing is you only
pay when a user views your video.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.070
So you can place your ad before
other videos, maybe you want

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.170
to make sure the content is similar,
we can go back to the travel.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.140
Example, so if I'm searching for
great places to travel and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.010
then I have let's say your hotel app.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.650
So maybe your ad,
you want to place your video ad before

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.220
I watch a video about this hotel
resort I'm going to go check out.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.790
Okay, so you can target your ads
based on theme or categories.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.840
And so then when your ad
shows before the video,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.030
the user then has a choice to
skip the ad or watch the full ad.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.890
Ideally, the ad is only about 15 or
30 seconds, but

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.940
you only pay when a user watches
30 seconds of the video or

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.310
the full length of the video.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.030
So if your video is only 15 seconds and

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.430
the user gets to the 15 second mark,
that's when you pay per view.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.070
But, if a user wants to skip
after two or five seconds,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.300
they have the choice to skip the ad.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.220
And what's great about this ad format
is that, your only capturing users that

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.090
are engaged,
that actually want to watch this ad,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.730
that are actually
interested in your product.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.350
And the rest,
you didn't even have to pay for, so

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.840
maybe they did watch 10 seconds and
maybe they'll think about you later, but

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.870
you don't actually have to pay for
that view.
