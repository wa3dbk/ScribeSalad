00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
Having figured this out, of course, Bob and Carol are both very, very happy--

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.020
not because they've actually solve their problem but now they know at least they can collaborate.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.070
They've basically double their chances, so if any one of them finds a bit algorithm for their problem,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.240
they will know they have a good polynomial time algorithm for both of their problems.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.380
Alice also arrives to the meeting, and of course, Alice is very excited

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.100
to hear about their discovery that Bob and Carol have made.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.790
Alice, of course, is hoping that maybe she can also find a connection of her problem

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.500
to Bob and Carol's problem or at least that they can help her find

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.220
a good algorithm for her problem by brainstorming.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.540
Alice explains her problem using the graph terminology as well, so Alice's problem

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:50.010
as you will remember is to find a set of vertices so that all of the edges are covered in a network here.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.030
For example if you take these three, then each edge has at least one endpoint

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.510
in those set of green vertices here.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.820
The input for Alice's problem is again a graph with n vertices and the output is the smallest

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.620
set of vertices such that all edges are covered, and of course, you know what I mean by covered.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.740
By covered I mean that each edge has at least one n point in the set of vertices.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.630
Then we should give that problem a name to refer to it such as Bob was working on clique

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.120
and Carol was working on independent set.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.980
We have Alice working on her problem, and since she is using the vertices to cover the edges,

00:01:26.980 --> 99:59:59.000
we'll call her problem vertex cover.
