00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right. Infinite loops, those are no fun at all.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to see my web page.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I don't want to wait an infinite number of seconds and then see my web page.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That's pretty long. I would get hungry before that ran out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Wouldn't it be nice if we could just tell if a program was going to loop forever or not?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then if it's going to loop forever, I won't run it or I'll print a little warning on the web page,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but I won't waste a lot of time on it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So what I'd really like to do is just look at the program source code

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
as we got it from the Web, say, and just be able to tell if it loops forever

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in one of these infinite loops or if it halts, if it stops,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if it settles down and returns an answer after some finite amount of time.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This seems like a totally legitimate request.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Unfortunately, it's not just difficult, it's actually impossible, provably impossible.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Not really hard, we're too lazy, we couldn't figure it out,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but we know you can't do it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You can't make this determination correctly every time.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
To see why this can't happen, let's assume we could solve it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and see what bad things happen to the world.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's assume that we have thought very hard about this

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and we have somehow implemented a magic procedure called halts

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which takes another procedure as an argument and returns True if that procedure halts

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and False if it loops forever.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now we'd know if it's safe to evaluate a web page.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We just look at all the JavaScript on the web page, we call halts on it,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
if that returns True every time, we can totally render that web page.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Let's test our understanding of this mythical halts procedure.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Over here on the left I've written 4 bits of Python code:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
vladimir, nabokov, pale, and fire,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and fire is in red because that's warm.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
One possibility is that we think vladimir halts;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
another possibility is that we think nabokov halts.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What I'd like you to do is tell me which of these 4 statements--

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
there could be multiple--are actually true.

00:01:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check each box that corresponds to a true fact.
