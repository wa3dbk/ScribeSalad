00:00:00.072 --> 00:00:02.190
To do that we'll have to go back in time to

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.280
the late 60s. So what was happening in the 60s? Well for

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.410
example the first man landed on the moon. That was also

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.720
time when Woodstock took place and also the time when the first

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.149
60 second picture from Polaroid was created. Concurrently to these events,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.910
which you probably didn't witness in first person, that was also the

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.280
time when people started to realize that they were not able

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.610
to build the software they needed. This happened for several reasons and

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.220
resulted in what we call the software crisis. So let's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.820
look at some of the most important reasons behind this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.760
crisis. The first cause was the rising demand for software.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.500
Now you're used to see software everywhere: in your phone,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.530
in your car, even your washing machine. Before the 60s,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.590
however, the size and complexity of software was very limited

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.580
and hardware components were really dominating the scene. Then things

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.490
started to change and software started to be increasingly prevalent.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.940
So we move from a situation where everything was mostly

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380
hardware to a situation in which software became more and more

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.660
important. To give an example, I'm going to show you the growth

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.080
in the software demand at NASA along those years. And in

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.610
particular, from the 1950s to more or less 2000. And this

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.350
is just a qualitative plot but that's more or less the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.880
ways things went. So the demand for software in NASA grow

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.930
exponentially. And the same happened in a lot of other companies.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.020
For example, just to cite one, for Boeing. So the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.350
amount of software on airplanes became larger and larger. The

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.170
second cause for the software crisis was the increasing amount

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.210
of development effort needed due to the increase of product complexity.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.260
Unfortunately, software complexity does not increase linearly with size. It

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.170
is not the same thing to write software for a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.410
class exercise or a small project, or a temp project,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.970
than it is to build a software for a word processor,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.950
an operating system, a distributed system, or even more complex and larger

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.390
system. And what I'm giving here is just an indicative size for

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.643
the software so the class exercise might be 100 lines of code,

00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:55.600
the small project might be 1000 lines of code, in the other thousand

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.328
lines of code, and so on and so forth. For the former,

00:01:58.328 --> 00:02:01.510
the heroic effort of an individual developer can get the job done.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.850
So that's what we call a programming effort. If you're a good

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.340
programmer, you can go sit down and do it, right. For the latter,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.330
this is not possible. This is what we called the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.810
software engineering effort. In fact, no matter how much programming languages,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.280
development environments, and software tools improve, developers could not keep

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.220
up with increasing software size and complexity. Which leads us to

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.280
the third problem that I want to mention and the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.020
third reason for the software crisis. And this cause is the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.790
slow developer's productivity growth. So let me show this again

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.243
with a qualitative diagram. And this is taken from the IEEE

00:02:32.243 --> 00:02:35.550
Software Magazine. And what I'm showing here is the growth in

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.930
software size and complexity over time, and how the developers' productivity

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.800
really couldn't keep up with this additional software complexity, which resulted

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.170
in this gap between what was needed and what was actually available.
