00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.552
Now I know that this last method that we used might have felt a little bit

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:07.512
tedious, and it definitely is a fair amount of work, but for certain equations,

00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:11.443
it's not too bad to work with. I think that it also really underscores exactly

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:15.327
how you get from the original expression you have to the factored form. It also

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:19.213
really highlights the connection between the different terms in each factor in

00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:23.654
the factored form. And how they connect back to the original expression. So even

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:27.622
if you always factor by grouping from here on out this still a good experience

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:31.398
to have had. It's your choice and frankly both methods do use some similar

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:35.322
reasoning. You're still thinking about what numbers add to equal the middle

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:39.498
coefficient, and multiply it to equal the product of the two outer coefficients.
