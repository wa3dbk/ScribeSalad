Affordances provide the opportunity for actions.

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:08.850
Anti affordances, prevent otherwise possible actions. So

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.930
these bars appear to be examples of anti affordances. Bars that prevent cars,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.690
trucks and other large vehicles, from driving on the road. And anti affordances,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.660
are quite useful in many situations.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.240
But, these bars only look like anti-affordances.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.775
They clearly signify non passage. But, but look

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:32.420
at the photographs. While the vertical bars appear

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.130
to signify that an automobile can't pass over

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.279
them. In this case, they're fake. They're false

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:42.151
anti-affordances. They signify non passage. But in fact,

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:45.550
they allow it. How? Well they bend when

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.030
a car passes over them. Or as shown in the photo, if someone steps on them.
