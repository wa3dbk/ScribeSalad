Right off the bat we know we have to deal with the distance between x and 4, so

00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:09.258
I can write the absolute value of x minus 4. And if this is at least 5, then I

00:00:09.258 --> 00:00:13.965
can translate that as, that this is greater than or equal to 5. So that's our

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:14.488
answer.
