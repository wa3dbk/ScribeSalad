Modifying our equation to get y all by itself on one side of the equation gives

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:10.024
us x over 10 minus 15 on the other side. There are of course several different

00:00:10.024 --> 00:00:14.052
ways you could write this. You could have just said 1 over 10 times x minus

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:17.049
150, those are equivalent.
