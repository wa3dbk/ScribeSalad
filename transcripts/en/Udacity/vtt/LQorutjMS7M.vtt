00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.823
Anxiety can actually be beneficial in some situations. For example, let's say

00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:07.925
you're anxious about studying for your final, well that anxiety can jump start

00:00:07.925 --> 00:00:10.745
you to actually start studying for the final in an effort to relieve your

00:00:10.745 --> 00:00:16.750
anxiety. However, for some people, anxiety can become excessive, which can lead

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.272
to a anxiety disorder. Now, there are a number of these types of disorders,

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:24.728
from generalized anxiety disorder to post traumatic stress syndrome, even

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:30.458
social anxiety disorder. In fact, obsessive compulsive disorder used to be

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:35.167
listed in the DSM as an anxiety disorder. However, in the newest version of the

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:40.150
DSM, it now has its own chapter. Research looking at the cause of anxiety

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.205
disorders, looks at both genetic and environmental factors. As with many other

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:48.809
topics, psychologists use twin studies to determine what's a genetic cause, and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.260
what's an environmental cause. And using a variety of techniques, researchers

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.920
have found the amygdala, and hippocampus, play an important role in most

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.200
anxiety disorders.
