00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.969
Let's jump right into lesson one with an example.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.090
Let's say you have a big exam tomorrow and

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.850
your memory needs to be as sharp as possible.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.200
What would you do to prepare? Well, let's say I

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.095
asked this question to a bunch of people and

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:16.540
42% said they would get a good workout the

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.830
night before, 28% said they would eat a good

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.370
dinner. 16% said they would stay up studying. 13% said

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.410
they'd get a good night's sleep. And the remaining 1% said something

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.830
else. Would you believe these survey results? Before deciding whether or not you

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.520
would, what would you want to know? How many people I surveyed, who

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.530
I surveyed, or maybe, how the survey was conducted. Check all that apply.
