00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.400
Welcome to Linux for Web Developers.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.580
I'm Mike Wills and
I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.150
Every time you visit a web application,
your browser is requesting a number of

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.180
files that are sitting on a server
somewhere out there on the Internet.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.260
More often than not,
that server is running Linux.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.210
Therefore, as you develop and get ready
to launch your own web applications,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.000
it's critical that you understand
how these servers work and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.920
how to get your web application up and
running on one.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.475
In this course you'll do just that.

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:30.220
You'll start with a quick
introduction to Linux, and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.570
you begin exploring
the Linux file system.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.520
How are files organized,
where do they belong.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.690
I'll then introduce you to a number
of Linux security concepts.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.640
Managing users, how to understand
permission system, firewalls, and

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.350
package or software management.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.290
Finally, you'll get a very
basic web application up and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.250
running using the Apache web server,
and a postscript SQL database server.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.220
Managing and configuring servers is one
of my favorite parts of this career.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.890
There's something very powerful in
knowing that you've taken a server from

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.690
zero to hero, all on your own and are in
full control of it's capabilities.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.590
I think you'll enjoy this experience,
and in the end, you'll be able to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.930
truly share your web applications with
others while having the most intimate,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.270
low level knowledge of how people
are actually receiving and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.700
experiencing your application.
