00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.250
So, now what we're seeing
are what I call interfaces.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.300
Each of the components that I just
mentioned, exports some interface,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.530
which explains to the client
of that component, or

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.720
the outside world, how to interact with
it, what capabilities it provides.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.940
In our case, those capabilities
are what we call predicates.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.200
You can think of them as
tables in a database.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.740
These are predicates, or
tables, that are accessible and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.410
visible to the outside world that
clients could query or update.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.760
And as you see here, even though we
have four different kinds of components,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.400
we only have two different kinds of
interfaces forecast and multipliers, and

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.710
this is by design.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.540
What that means is that I can,
as you see in this example,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.320
I can have multiple components
that implement the same interface.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.140
Now what's nice about that
is components that implement

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.770
the same interface are plug compatible,
and layered assemblies.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.640
So I can actually build different
assemblies that use each of these

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.060
components, each of these three forecast
components that I've just declared.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.880
Put them together in different ways and
build a nice,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.270
rich library of variance,
just by putting those forecasts,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.660
just by putting those
together in different ways.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.610
&gt;&gt; And can you relate this
use of the term interface to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.170
its use in other languages like Java?

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.780
&gt;&gt; Yes it's almost exactly the same use.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.750
So in Java interfaces you declare
signatures of methods that

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.360
many different objects would, obviously
many different classes could implement.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.530
It's essentially the same thing here.
