00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.204
To use the rational zero theorem, we first need to find all the factors of

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:10.591
negative 164 and positive 1. Well, 1 is easy. We just have 1 and negative 1.

00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:16.882
There are a few more for negative 164. We have 1, 2, 4, 41, 82, 164 and the

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:22.279
negative versions of all of those numbers. Now that we have two sets of

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.503
factors, all we need to do is take one factor from this batch and divide it by

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:30.338
one of the factors from over here. Now, since all the factors on this right,

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:33.614
that we are going to be dividing by, are just 1 and negative 1, the only ratios

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:38.661
you would end up with are all of the numbers over here. So, there we go, we

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.682
have the list we were looking for. Even though this is still a lot of numbers,

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:46.322
it's way fewer than the infinite number we were thinking about before, when we

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:49.426
had no idea what the roots were.
