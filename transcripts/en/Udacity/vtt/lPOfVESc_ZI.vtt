Let's find where on our graph we have x equals negative 4. So I'll count over,

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:09.770
negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, on the x axis. And then slide

00:00:09.782 --> 00:00:14.695
down to the graph. What is that y coordinate? Maintain this vertical position,

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:19.765
but sliding over to the y axis, we can see that this is halfway between negative

00:00:19.777 --> 00:00:24.690
16 negative 18, so y is equal to negative 17 when X equals negative 4. That

00:00:24.702 --> 00:00:29.885
means that this point right here on the graph is negative 4, negative 17. When Y

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:34.496
equals negative 9, you can start on our Y axis and go all the way down to

00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:39.616
negative 9, and then slide over to the graph. Keep the same horizontal position

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:44.690
of my pencil tip and slide up to the X axis. That is half way between negative 1

00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:49.275
and negative 2, so that means that this point right here must be negative 1 and

00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:53.635
a half, negative 9. So when y is negative 9, x is equal to negative 1.5. Of

00:00:53.647 --> 00:00:57.845
course, you could also write this in fractional form if you wanted to. Of

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:02.470
course, to make sure that our graph and the conclusions that we've drawn for it

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:06.851
are totally accurate, we can always plug in these values to our equation, to

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:09.186
figure out the value of the other variable.
