But what about this m, now we know the y and x are variables. If I plug in a

00:00:04.552 --> 00:00:09.145
value for x, I get a value for y. Just like for intercept if x is zero then y

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:14.051
would be equal to three. So what about this m, what is this thing we've labeled

00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:19.119
m correspond to? Let's see, instead of looking at these graphs I'm going to look

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.341
at two different graphs. Graphs that have different m's.. Here is the line y

00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:29.334
equals 2x plus 3, and this is the line y equals one half x plus three. So what's

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:34.294
different between these two graphs? Is it the steepness? The y-ntercept or the b

00:00:34.294 --> 00:00:36.426
in the equation y equals mx plus b.
