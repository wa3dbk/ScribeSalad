Welcome to Unit 6. The big idea in Unit 6 is recursive definitions and we'll see

00:00:03.956 --> 00:00:07.380
how to use a recursive definition of popularity to make the search engine

00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:10.993
respond with the best page for a given query instead of just giving us all the

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.835
pages. This is really a key advance that made Google so successful. The real

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:18.695
goal of this unit is to give you infinite power. I know what you're thinking, I

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:22.620
have infinite power already, and you're right. You've had infinite power since

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:26.485
Unit 2 when you learned about procedures and if. And that was enough to write

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:30.270
every possible computer program. But we went on to introduce while, to use a

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:34.160
while loop to find all the links in a page. And that really should not have been

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:38.170
necessary. If you already had infinite power, you wouldn't have needed anything

00:00:38.182 --> 00:00:41.467
new to do that. What we're going to see in this unit is that you could do that

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.786
without while, that all you really need is procedures, and by thinking about

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:47.775
things recursively, you can solve lots of problems in interesting ways.
