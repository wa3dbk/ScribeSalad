00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
So, now that we've seen a couple of different functions, let's talk about how to

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.161
actually use them. When we had a computer program, we saw that we would take our

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:13.715
function, type the name out, and then in the parentheses, where we know that the

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:17.924
input goes, we could type a specific number like 4 for example, like we did

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:22.339
before. And then because the function was already defined in the program, when

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.418
we ran this, with an actual number as the input, it would give us an answer. It

00:00:26.418 --> 00:00:31.562
would spit out in this case a 1. We can do a similar thing with the mathematical

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:35.289
version of this function. Once again, in the slot where the input goes. Inside

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.733
the parenthesis right here, we can write a number. Let's pick a different one

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:44.309
this time just to spice things up a little bit. Maybe 5. Now the way that we use

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.128
this new input of 5, is we substitute it in to all the places where we see x in

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:53.987
the expression on the right hand side over here. So, in fact the first term you

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:57.556
see is an x, so we replace that with the 5. And then the rest of the expression

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:02.283
is the same. We started off with f of x equals x minus 3 and that means we know

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:06.992
that f of 5 is equal to 5 minus 3. We can evaluate this to see that f of 5 is

00:01:06.992 --> 00:01:12.514
equal to 2. So 5 here is our input, and when plugged in to this function, the

00:01:12.514 --> 00:01:18.052
function relates the input of 5 to an output, which in this case is 2. This in

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:22.263
fact creates a point for us. We can now plot the point 5 comma 2. This is a

00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:27.018
point that lies on this line. Since we know that we're just replacing our

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:31.837
dependent variable with f of x instead of y, we graph all the values of f of x

00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:36.879
of the function of the output just as we would y values on the vertical axis.

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:42.012
So, what if I have a different function instead? Maybe f of x equals x squared.

00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:45.752
What if I want to plug in 4 as the input for this equation? What would the

00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:49.584
function give me as the output then? Please simplify your answer as much as

00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:51.920
possible, so that it's just a single number.
