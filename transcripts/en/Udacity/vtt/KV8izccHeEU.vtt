00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
On face value, the next type of partnership is the most unlikely.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.800
It's when competitors get together in programs to do something jointly for their industry,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.740
for example, tradeshows, industry associations, etc.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.900
It turns out the automobile industry action group has 900 members

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.090
of competitors who also to vie to sell the same products to the auto industry.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.910
Fashion week in New York, another example.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.180
All the fashion vendors, all the suppliers of high-end fashion get together,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.950
and actually work together to promote a joint view of the industry.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.560
So coopetition is another potential area for partners.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.280
Also, industry specs, technical committees,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.410
you'll see competitors who normally outside that building

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.700
who do nothing better than run each other over with a car

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.830
actually sitting and trying to define a joint technical specifications.
