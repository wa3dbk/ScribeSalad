00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.600
So the way we do this is, if we go into the Object

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.125
Set Up Details Page. So just navigating to Object Set Up. There you go.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:09.940
&gt;&gt; I mean in the quick access menu.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We can go right there and then create the action ourselves.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.895
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:15.820
&gt;&gt; So if we scroll down one of these

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.130
related lists is Button Links and Actions. And so that

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.180
will allow us to create an action that we can

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.980
drag onto the page laypout. And then access from Chatter.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.640
&gt;&gt; Okay. So,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.020
buttons, links, and actions. A new action, I'm guessing?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.200
&gt;&gt; Yup. So, there are a couple different types of

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.280
actions we can make. One is creating, like, a child record.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.540
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.480
&gt;&gt; Now, what's great about this if you choose this is

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.390
you can, one, it'll automatically relate the child to the parent.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.450
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.520
&gt;&gt; But you could also pre-define fields if you wanted to, things like that.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.980
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.780
&gt;&gt; or a couple of the other actions. Log a call, we could use some

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.860
code if we wanted to put a visual force page in there. Or, update the record

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.250
itself, not necessarily a child record, but update like the stage.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.940
&gt;&gt; So, okay, the stage but not update the child record.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.450
&gt;&gt; But I can create a child. Create a set time.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.160
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.060
&gt;&gt; Okay. So that's what I'm going to do. Target

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.890
Object will be Set Time. Label would be what?

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.780
&gt;&gt; Let's call it Add a Set Time.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.080
&gt;&gt; Oh, this is just what's going to say.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.150
&gt;&gt; On the action, exactly. And then we don't need

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.160
to choose that. If we choose something there it automatically

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.030
names it for us.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.220
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.150
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's good?

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.140
&gt;&gt; And so now this is the mini page layout,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.586
so when we have, you know, a new record import form.

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:30.128
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:30.128 --> 00:01:33.190
&gt;&gt; it's going to ask us what fields from set time do you want to show up

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.430
on this form when you're creating the child

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.260
set time. So probably everything, I would guess.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.830
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.160
&gt;&gt; But, I mean, if you had an object

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.152
that had a lot of fields, you probably would

00:01:42.152 --> 00:01:42.698
[CROSSTALK].

00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:43.676
&gt;&gt; You might just want to get the.

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:44.524
&gt;&gt; The main fields. Exactly.

00:01:44.524 --> 00:01:47.860
&gt;&gt; Okay, but we don't have a lot of fields. We'll do date, status and time.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.785
&gt;&gt; Andy, your UX skills are impeccable.

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:54.657
[LAUGH]

00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:57.168
&gt;&gt; All right, Save.

00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:57.797
&gt;&gt; Yep.
