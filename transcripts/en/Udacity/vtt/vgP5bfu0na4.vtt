00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's talk a little bit about SQL, or "sequel," or structured query language.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
SQL is a language.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's not quite a programming language, but it's a language for expressing queries,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and so you would use SQL on a relational database

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to ask questions of the database to get that out of it,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so MySQL, postgreSQL, SQLite.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Obviously they all have SQL in the name, and they all use SQL for

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
putting data into the database and getting data out.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It was invented in the 1970s,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which was long before the internet existed or the Web existed

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
or web applications even existed,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so SQL was designed to solve problems that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
are very much different from the problems you'll be solving

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
building a consumer web application.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There's still a lot of very important parts to SQL,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we'll be discussing the major pieces today

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
so you can know how to use them, but just keep in mind that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
SQL and relational databases have existed long before the Web,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and so there are some things that aren't exactly relevant.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
SQL looks a little something like this.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This is a basic SQL query,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and what this says is select,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which basically means retrieve data, *,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
this means all columns, from links, this is the table

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that we're fetching data from, where, ID = 5,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and this is a constraint.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
SQL, as you can see, it's a fairly readable language.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Select all from links where ID = 5.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's almost similar to the quiz I gave you earlier in this lesson.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There are a couple parts of this line that are relevant.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This first section, the select *,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
this is basically what we're selecting.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The can--instead of being a--can actually be a list of columns,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but for a lot of things we're going to be doing, we'll be selecting all of the columns.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But if you don't want all of the columns, let's say you just wanted

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
just the URL from the links, it might look something like this:

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
select url, and you could put a comma, select url, title

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
if you wanted to select just the URL and the title.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But we'll be using * for now.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now from, this is the from clause right here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This is where we're going to fetch the data from,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so we've only talked about really one table, our links table,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and in my example, that's what I'm going to use.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But you can actually include any table of your making or multiple tables,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and we'll talk briefly about what that means a little bit later,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but for now, we're just going to be selecting from the links table,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and that's the name of the table we made.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Where, now the rest of the SQL, or the rest of the SQL you can see here,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
this is the where clause, and these are the constraints.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
These are which rows from our table to return,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and this is actually a really interesting part of the statement here.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We can actually put quite a lot in here.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Let's play around with this a little bit in the IDE and see how it works.
