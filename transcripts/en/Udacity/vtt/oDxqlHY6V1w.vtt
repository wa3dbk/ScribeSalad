00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Ah! That's good.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.000
Or is it empty?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.500
You can't really tell.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
I hope everyone has enjoyed our field trips as much as I have.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's really been a great time doing this,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it's been an amazing experience to teach this class.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You're nearing the end of the class

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but I hope just the beginning of your journey in computing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There's a lot more exciting things to do after this,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
including taking the courses that we'll be offering starting in April,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but I hope all of you will find more exciting things to do in computing after this class.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's really been an amazing and wonderful experience for me to teach it,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it's been a privilege to have so many students from so many different places

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in the class and to see how much you've all contributed to make the class great

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the effort that you've put into it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.500
So I hope everyone has had a great experience.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
Stay udacious, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
