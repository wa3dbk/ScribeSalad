00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's say say we want to change
a compile flag in our Java project.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.536
We can just add some configuration
to the compile Java task.

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:09.217
However, unlike simple Java projects,

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:14.053
which have a finite set of tasks such
as, compile Java, jar, test, etc.

00:00:14.053 --> 00:00:16.625
Android projects can have
an indeterminate number of tasks,

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:20.080
depending on the build types and
product flavors we have declared.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.610
Additionally, the names of
these tasks are generated, and

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.130
they're based on the name of
the particular variant the task is for.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.020
Not only that, but these tasks
are created at a very late stage of

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.970
the project configuration life cycle.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.490
Which means, in most cases,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.220
we can't directly reference
them in our build script.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.150
Essentially, we need
to solve two problems.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.560
First, we need a way to reference each
task used to build a particular variant

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.210
without having to know
the task's actual name.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.910
Quite simply, we want to configure all
the tasks of a particular type for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.170
every variant.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
Second, we need a way to defer
the configuration of that task

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.690
until after all of our build
variants have been created.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.130
Which really just means that we can't
configure the task until a task exists.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.120
The first problem is solved by
the Android Gradle Plugin itself,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.700
which groups all the information
to include the tasks

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.600
associated with any given
variant into a single object.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.620
There are three main types of these
objects, the Application Variant,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.740
the Library Variant or the Test Variant.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.520
The type of variant we need depends on
the type of project we're building.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.750
Application Variants and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.390
Library Variants are created for Android
Applications or libraries respectively.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.880
And Test Variants are created for
the on device test APK.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.090
Each one has its own specific
properties, but they all have common

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.110
tasks, like compiling Java,
merging resources, and so on.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.060
So the Android Griddle plugin is
nice enough to neatly package all

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.610
the information about a variant for

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.990
us, but the problem remains, how do
we reference these variant objects?

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.160
This problem is solved by what
Gradle calls live collections.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.680
Essentially, as the Android
plugin creates variants,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.960
they are added to a fancy
type of collection.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.310
These collections allow us
to define configurations for

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.260
objects that don't yet exist.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.660
Instead, Gradle will remember
our configuration and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.950
execute it when a new object is added.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.760
We specify this configuration
by calling the all method

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.360
on our variant collection.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.110
For example, if we wanted to configure
all the Java compile tasks for

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.970
our application variants
to add a compiler argument,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.620
we could do something like this.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.880
This will now configure each Java
compile task for each of our debug build

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.110
types, regardless of how many
product flavors we have configured.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.660
Also, you don't have to try and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.210
guess what the final names of
each of those tasks might be.
