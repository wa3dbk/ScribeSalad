00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.440
This course has four parts.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.260
Just now, you're going to lay
the foundations by training your first

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.110
simple model entirely end-to-end.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.930
For that, we'll need to talk
about logistic classification,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.130
stochastic optimization and
general data practices to train models.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.950
In the next session,
we're going to go deeper.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.860
You'll train your first deep network and
you'll also learn to

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.660
apply regularization techniques
to train even bigger models.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.390
The third session will be a deep dive
into images and convolutional models.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
The fourth session, all about text and
sequences in general.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650
We'll train embeddings and
recurrent models.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.180
This is going to be
a very hands-on course.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.260
The assignments are IPython notebooks
that you can read and modify easily.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.820
Play with them and try things out.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.800
We will use them alongside the lectures

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.260
to make everything you will
hear about very concrete.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.280
All the code will be
written in TensorFlow,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.390
a very simple Python-based
deep learning toolkit.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.540
By the time you are done
with these lectures,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.050
you'll be able to apply all
this knowledge to new problems

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.100
entirely by yourself with
a handful of lines of code.
