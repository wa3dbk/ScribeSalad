00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.020
I'm Pete Lepage, a developer
advocate on the web team at Google.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.160
In this course,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.490
I'm going to teach you the fundamentals
of progressive web apps.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.060
And you're going to put
your new skills to work

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.980
building your own progressive web app.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.880
Progressive web apps are experiences
that combine the best of the web and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.510
the best of apps.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.650
They give users the kind of reliable,
fast, and engaging experience

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.620
that they've come to expect from native
apps, but delivered through the web.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.300
They're reliable and
load quickly, even on slow or

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.220
intermittent networks, or
when there's no network at all.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.030
They're fast, and scroll,
and animate smoothly.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.000
They're engaging, sending relevant
push notifications to users.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.450
And they're integrated,
showing up on the home screen and

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.539
loading as a top level, full screen app.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.830
In this course, you'll learn how
to architect a single page app

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.230
using the app shell model which
separates content form the data, and

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.120
how to ensure that the app gets data
onscreen as quickly as possible.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.710
Then we'll dive in to service workers.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.400
You'll learn about different
caching strategies and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.720
how to use the most appropriate ones for
different needs.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.200
By the end of the lesson,
your progressive web app

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.260
will use a service worker to
cache the app shell and the data.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.850
So it'll work whether your online or
offline.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.920
Finally, you'll learn the ins and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.789
out of how to make your app
installable via the web app manifest.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.920
All of these features are built
entirely using progressive enhancement.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.970
They will light up and be available to
users who have a browser that support

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.410
them, while other users will
still get a standard experience.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.650
So, let's get started!
