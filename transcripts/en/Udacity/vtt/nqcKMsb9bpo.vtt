00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.909
Let's draw another red triangle

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:03.356
Here is my string

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:05.958
and the end of it is at the origin.

00:00:05.958 --> 00:00:08.061
Here is a horizontal distance

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:10.776
and here is a vertical distance.

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:14.688
Now between these two triangles that we created

00:00:14.688 --> 00:00:17.056
which two side lengths are the same?

00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:21.056
You can check which of the sides you think 
are equal.
