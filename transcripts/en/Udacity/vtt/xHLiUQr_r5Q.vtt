00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.150
If you think back to the table
views we've built so

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.420
far, Bond villains, make your
own adventure, favorite things.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.422
They all had an array of data that
they used to populate a table.

00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:14.090
For meme, we're going to have two
view controllers displaying memes.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.000
A collection and a table.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.320
They could each have their
own separate array of memes.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.090
But that doesn't seem right.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.950
The two ViewControllers should
be accessing the same data using

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.560
a shared model.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.950
So where can one keep a data model so

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.740
that it can be accessed
by both ViewControllers?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.470
The AppDelegate, the delegate
to the UIApplication object,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.720
is a good place because it can be
accessed from anywhere in your project.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.810
Now keeping data in the App delegate
is a little bit controversial.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.430
But in our case,
it's the simplest option.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.140
And there are solid precedents for it,
including Xcode's core data templates.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.250
You can add your memes array to
the App Delegate with this line of code.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.040
And whenever you create a meme,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.340
you'll want to add it to
the app delegates array.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.230
So you could add the following code in
the view controller that edits the meme.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.330
And finally, when you want to access
this data from the collection view

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.180
controller or the table view controller,
you could add these lines.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.640
For a recap of the code in these three
methods, see the upcoming text note.
