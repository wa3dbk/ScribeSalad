00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.450
In this lesson we're going to to take
a look at some of the ways that network

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.910
speed and other properties affect your
users experience of your web apps.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.720
Networks are not infinitely fast.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.740
It takes time for
traffic to get from here to there and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.200
sometimes it takes way too long.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.390
If you're building or maintaining a web
application you're probably going to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.200
care about this because as
a rule users hate waiting.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.570
Even if you put clever sayings
on the loading screen.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.270
You'd still rather be
watching the course right?

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.230
And slowness isn't the only way
the network can get in the way of your

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.070
users.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.200
Middle boxes or devices that block or

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.712
alter network traffic
such as fire walls.

00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:41.720
Can create really puzzling problems
between your users and you.
