00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.689
So now we will go through several
types of multiprocessors.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.110
The first type of multiprocessor
uses what is called a centralized

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.440
shared memory.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.600
So all the cores, let's say we have 4
of them, might have their own caches,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.570
but then they're all
connected to the same bus, so

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.910
they can all access the same main
memory and input output devices.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.420
These cores can share data by simply
reading and writing the main memory,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.380
assuming of course that these reads and
writes go through the caches properly,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.170
and we will see that we can
achieve that, so pretty much,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.450
this core can send data to this core
by writing to some memory location,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.180
and then this core reads it from there.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.790
Similarly, any of the cores can
access any of the other devices here.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.750
This type of a system is
really what today's multi-core

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.590
processors tend to look like,
and it's also called UMA,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.870
which stands for
uniform memory access time.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.500
But it's not UMAT, it's just UMA.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.250
But what is uniform is really
the time to access the memory.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.030
Why?
Well, because this main memory

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.970
is at the same long distance
from all of the cores.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.420
Yes, it can be slightly
closer to some of them.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.900
But because they are all
connected to it in the same way,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.640
the memory really is about as bad
to access as any one of them.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.900
This time of multiprocessing
is also called SMP,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.649
which stands for
Symmetric Multiprocessor.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.870
It's called symmetric
because any core and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.840
its cache look just like any other
core and its cache in the system.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.790
So if we have two cores, we can just
take one of them with its caches and

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.340
replicate to make a four-core system.
