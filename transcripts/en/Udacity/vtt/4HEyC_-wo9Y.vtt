00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.760
A drug is any chemical that influences biological processes when introduced

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.274
into the body. Now, it's really important to know that drugs don't introduce

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:15.470
any novel physiological responses in the body, or in the brain. Rather, drugs

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.150
can disrupt our homeostasis. Within our body, we maintain our internal

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.067
environment within certain limits. For example, our body maintains things like

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:30.140
our temperature, our water content, our sodium content, even our heart rate.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.482
Our resting heart rate is between 40 and 100 beats per minute. But,

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:39.227
methamphetamine can push our heart rate way out of this range in unsafe levels

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:44.770
of over 200 beats per minute. So, we see here that methamphetamine doesn't

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.465
cause any new responses in our body. We already have a heart rate, doesn't

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:54.049
create that. But it affects the homeostasis, so it increases our heart rate.
