00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.080
Great work!

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.240
You've learned how to use public and
private interfaces, class methods and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.850
variables, inheritance,
and meaningful errors.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.430
Slowly but surely, your objects
are starting to more closely map

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.870
the behaviors of real life objects.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.100
Writing code doesn't always have to
be about thinking like a computer.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.050
Sometimes it's just about getting your
computer to think more like a human.
