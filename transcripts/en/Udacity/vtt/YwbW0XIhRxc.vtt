00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.670
Let us see if we can do some full predication of our own.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.300
Suppose that this is the original code where we check if R2 is equal to 0.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.670
If it is we jump here and decrement our R1 by 1. If R2 is not 0,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.450
then we continue increment R1 by 1 and

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.020
then go out. So after if conversion with full predication we get this.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:36.170
First we set predicates P1 and P2 according to whether R2 is equal to 0.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.139
And remember that this one will be set. If R2 is equal to 0,

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:47.249
and this one is set if R2 is not equal to 0. So

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:52.540
they are opposite predicates. This one is set if R2 is equal to 0.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.540
The actual question for you is what goes into the predicate for

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.146
the next instruction. And the predicate for the next instruction after that.

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:07.884
And then, the two instructions are add R1, R1,

00:01:07.884 --> 00:01:13.630
1 and add R1, R1 minus 1. So what are the predicates here?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.330
Also, if we assume that this code gets us a CPI of 0.5 without mispredictions.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.680
And that the misprediction penalty is ten cycles.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.880
Then we should do the if conversion if the branch equals 0 here

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.730
is predicted below what accuracy. So doing conversion if

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.980
branch equals 0 prediction is less than what percentage correct.
