00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to homework one. We're going to be breaking some code today.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What you need to do for this homework is break a few incorrect implementations

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of the fixed-size queue we've been working with earlier in the unit.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's go ahead and take a look at what the queue is supposed to do first.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The queue class is just a fixed-size queue of integers and the constructor down here

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is supposed to take a single integer parameter greater than 0.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That is the maximum number of elements that the queue can hold at a time,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and there are four methods that we're going to need to concern ourselves with,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and these method calls are all you're going to have access to during this.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The empty call should return true if and only if the queue

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
currently holds no elements and false, otherwise.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The full method should do the exact opposite.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It should return true if and only if the queue cannot hold anymore elements--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
it's completely full and false, otherwise.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You would call it like this or like this or the empty and full methods, respectively.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The enqueue is the only one that takes a parameter. It takes an integer to put into the queue.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It returns true if it's successfully does so and it returns false, otherwise,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which would only happen or should only happen if the queue is full.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The dequeue method does not take any parameters or removes an integer from the queue and returns it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If it doesn't, if it fails to return anything, which should only happen

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
if the queue is empty, then it returns none.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
As an example if this code where we first create a queue of size 1, then we check if it's empty,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
which it should be immediately since we haven't done anything with it so it's empty,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
should be true then we try to enqueue the number of 10 which also should succeed since

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
it should be able to hold one more element so succeeded should be true then we check if it's full

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which should also be true because we just enqueued one element we can only

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
hold one element so it's full should be through then we dequeue that element and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
should return 10 the value, so value should be 10 in here to give an idea of what we

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
should expect from the queue implementation.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now the five queues that you're going to test for are going to have bugs here and there in them,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
so they're not going to behave exactly like this.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I very much recommend reading over this specification carefully before you start testing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now to test the five queues you're going to do exactly what you do here.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You would instantiate queue and call these four methods in sum fashion and then

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
using assert statements, you would try to break this code and draw in it assertion error.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
On the back end, we'll have a test harness that runs your code against all of the buggy queue

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
implementations and will return the incorrect output if you manage to find it and when you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
run submit bin on your code it will tell you how many of the buggy queue implementations

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
you have manage to successfully catch.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
As an example of what your test code should do if we run my implementation against the buggy code

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
then we see that we get in assertion error here.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So your code should run assertion errors for all of the buggy code.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We'll have a test harness that will run your code against all five of the incorrect implementations

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and when you submit your code we'll tell you how many of the implementations

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
you've managed to successfully catch and your goal is to catch all five.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It took me, I think 22 lines to catch all the bugs--so let's see if you can beat me.
