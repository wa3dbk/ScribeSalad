00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.499
Now the second phase of this algorithm uses this table to construct the output order.

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:08.485
What we're looking to generate is the list of nodes in order, and we computed this before.

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:12.026
We see it over here: 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 9, 1, 6, 3, 8.

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:17.211
Remember we can get that by using a serial algorithm just to convince ourselves that it's correct.

00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:21.497
We start at node 0, its successor is 5, the successor to 5 is 2,

00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:23.759
the successor to 2 is 7 and so on.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.431
To generate this answer, each node is going to compute its position in the output list,

00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:30.867
and we're going to call that position outpos,

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:36.645
and then when we're done, we can use that position to scatter the node into its proper location in that output list.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.975
So just to understand what outpos is going to look like,

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:44.614
we see that node 0 ends up at location 0 in the output list, so outpos better be 0.

00:00:44.614 --> 00:00:50.172
Node 5 ends up at the first location in the output list, so it's going to get outpos equals 1.

00:00:50.172 --> 00:00:53.289
Node 2 was next and then node 7, and so on.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.993
So this is what we're trying to compute here.

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:56.821
We're trying to compute outpos.

00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:03.636
So when we start this, all we know is that node 0 is in position 0, so we can fill in that outpos right away.

00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:06.811
Now that node 0 is calculated where it will end up in the output,

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:10.107
we're going to consider it awake, but all the other nodes are asleep.

00:01:10.107 --> 00:01:14.684
A node is awake if it has filled in its value for outpos, otherwise it's asleep.

00:01:14.684 --> 00:01:19.200
So now we're going to do several iterations of an algorithm that will eventually wake up all the nodes

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050
and calculate their output positions.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.785
So on each iteration we're going to launch N threads, 1 per element here,

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.623
but if a thread is asleep we immediately return from that thread.

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:29.925
Only awake threads do any work at all.

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:35.165
So for the first iteration, node 0 wants to wake up its successor, so how does it find the successor?

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:39.103
Well it can look in this plus 1 array to find its immediate successor,

00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:42.004
and so we can immediately see that's node 5.

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.472
So where will node number 5 write its output?

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:46.895
That's what we need to fill in here for outpos.

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:50.058
It knows that it's coming after node number 0, right here,

00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:53.972
and it knows that it's coming 1 hop past node number 0.

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:56.350
So we can add these 2 values together

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.922
to see that node number 5 will write its output to position number 1 in the output array,

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:05.593
and so now we have 2 nodes that are awake: Node 0, node 5.

00:02:05.593 --> 00:02:08.864
So now both awake nodes are going to wake up another node

00:02:08.864 --> 00:02:11.581
and help those nodes calculate their output position.

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.710
So now instead of looking at the immediate successors plus 1,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.080
we're going to look at the next line, plus 2,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.277
and we're going to use this to find the nodes 2 away from each of our awake nodes,

00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:24.713
so node 0 is going to wake up node number 2.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:27.869
So node 0 is going to wake up node number 2,

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.204
and so where does node 2 write its output?

00:02:30.204 --> 00:02:35.515
Well it'll be the sum of where node 0 is at output location 0, and we know we're 2 hops away,

00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:39.881
so when we add those 2 up we know that node 2 will be written to position number 2.

00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:45.183
Similarly node 5 is going to wake up the node that's 2 hops away; in this case, node 7.

00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:47.070
Where will node 7 write its output?

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.939
It knows that it'll start from node number 5 at position number 1,

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.275
and then we'll add 2 hops to that and get position number 3.

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:56.852
On the next iteration, we're going to use the next line of the array, the plus 4 array,

00:02:56.852 --> 00:03:01.382
and each of the 4 awake nodes from output position 0, 1, 2, and 3

00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:04.126
will wake up the node that's 4 hops away.

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:07.090
This will allow us to fill in 4 more values into the outpos array.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.625
Node 4 will get position number 4, node 9 gets position 5, node 1 gets position 6, and node 6 gets position 7,

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:17.065
and the final iteration using the plus 8 array

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:21.005
let's us fill in node 3 as outpos 8 and node 8 as outpos 9.

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:28.055
So the final step is to use outpos to scatter the nodes to their destinations, so let's see how that works.

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:33.048
We're going to start by looking at the first node, and we know that node 0 is going to end up in output position 0.

00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:36.554
So we will scatter this 0 to output location 0 and write the 0.

00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:40.414
The next node, node number 1, is going to end up in output position 6.

00:03:40.414 --> 00:03:44.610
The next node, node 2, will end up directly in output position 2,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.282
and so after we do all of these scatter operations,

00:03:47.282 --> 00:03:50.005
we come up with the nodes in the correct order.

00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:53.002
So as a function of N how many steps does this take?

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:56.453
Square root of N, log N, N or N squared?
