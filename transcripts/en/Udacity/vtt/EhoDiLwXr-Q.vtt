00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.770
Try multiplying this one out. We have the binomial of 3 root 3 plus 5 squared.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.560
Think about what the square really means, and then see if you can figure out

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.530
the answer. As a caution, you can't distribute a square over a sum. We know

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.958
that's not true. Again, think back to polynomials, and you might be able to

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.435
figure it out. Try your best.
