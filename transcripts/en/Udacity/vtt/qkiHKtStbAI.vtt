00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.900
With our ListView ready to go, we'll want
to create some fake data to populate it.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.078
Open up MainActivity.java
and then scroll down to the bottom

00:00:09.078 --> 00:00:11.980
where the PlaceholderFragment class is.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.060
Within the onCreateView method,
create an array list of strings

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.980
to represent the weather forecast
list items shown in the wire frames.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.967
For example, the Today list item will
be represented as a string shown here.

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:26.267
When you're done,
check the box and submit.
