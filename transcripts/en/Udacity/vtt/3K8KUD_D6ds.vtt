00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.710
in. &gt;&gt; That's good David, and to builder's example, what do we actually do,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.610
when we have to? Plan a navigation route to go from one location,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.390
to another location, in an urban area. We use knowledge of the goal.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.400
The goal tells us, what turn to take at every intersection? We want to take

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.670
a turn, that helps us get closer to the goal. So one thing we are learning here,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.170
is there are different kinds of knowledge. There is knowledge about the world,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.090
the intersections and the turns, the states and the operators more generally.

00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:52.230
There's also asset knowledge about how to do the operator selection, how to

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.740
select between greatest terms at any intersection? This knowledge is tacit, and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.010
is sometimes called control knowledge. Goals provide us with the control

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.487
knowledge, of deciding how to select between different operators. Let us

00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:10.485
recall how means-end analysis work. How goals poetic control knowledge, and

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:14.160
means-end analysis heuristic method, if you would compare the Current State and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.330
the Goal State and enumerate the differences between them.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.910
Then we'll select the operator that will help us reduce,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.350
the largest difference within the Current State and the Goal State. That's one,

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.540
way of using goals as control knowledge to select between operators. Planning,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.200
provides more system mathematics matters for selecting between different

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.870
operators. So the real problem now becomes, how to do operator selection,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.040
which is the same problem as, how to do action selection. Recall with me,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.350
we're talking about intelligent agents. We define intelligent agents,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.800
as agents that map perceptual history into actions.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.250
Action selection was a key problem, was a central problem. This is

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.880
where planning is central, because it deals starkly with action selection, or

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.070
with operator selection. Operators simply mental representations of actions,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.870
that we live with in the world. So, let us look at what a plan might look like,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.500
in the language we have been developing for

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.750
planning. A plan might look like this, here is the Initial State, and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.970
a set of successor states. A series of states, punctuated by an operators

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.420
that transform one state into another. Here we have expanded this operative,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.570
paint ceiling, to specify its peak conditions and post conditions, and there's

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.940
several things not worthy here. Note that the preconditions of this operator,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.470
exactly match the predecessor's state. So, we have on robot ladder, here,

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.730
and we have on robot ladder, here. So, some assertions of the world are true,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.370
here. And those assertions match the precondition,

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.720
which is why this operator is applicable. Similarly, the post conditions of this

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.870
operator, directly match the assertions about the world in this successor state.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.470
So I have painted ceiling here, there is painted ceiling there.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.540
There is not dry ceiling here, there is not dry ceiling here.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.510
So this provides a very precise way, of specifying the states, and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.190
the operators, and t he exact connections between them.
