00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
One way of solving this is the following. We check h times the step number, is the current time.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If the current time is larger than or equal to 2 hours, and if we didn't fire the boost before,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we fire the boost and then remember that we actually did fire the boost.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So next time around, the boost is not going to be fired.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You could in principle also check for equality over the time exactly equals to ours or not.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But that's very dangerous with floating point numbers.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You may miss by a very tiny fraction when the boost is to be done,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we change the velocity by 300 m/s that is times the vector which looked somewhat crazy.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What we need is a vector of length 1 in the right direction, that is in the direction of travel.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
300 times that vector is going to provide us

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
with a vector of length 300 in the direction of travel.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So what happens to velocity? We take the existing velocity divided by it's length.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This way, we get the vector of length 1 in the direction of travel.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
300 times this vector is just the vector that we need to change the velocity vector.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There is one more line in this solution. If we fire the rocket, we place a red dot and this is the result.

00:01:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We see the orbit starting here and then the rocket boost takes us to a different orbit.
