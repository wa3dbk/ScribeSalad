00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.621
What if I change the if and the else? Switch them around and make the greater

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:10.160
than into a less than. Will the discounted prices computed by this piece of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.969
code be the same as the prices computed by this piece of code? If we instead

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.909
use this piece of code, what will the discounted price for a flight to Las

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:23.821
Vegas be? How about for Chicago and New York?
