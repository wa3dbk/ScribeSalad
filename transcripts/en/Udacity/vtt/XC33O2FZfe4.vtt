00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.420
There are several consequences of using a singleton pattern.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.460
One of the benefits is, you provide controlled access.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.850
The only way to get access to the singleton instance is through that, that class

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.180
operation. This has the potential of reducing problems with the names,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.260
the program name space. In particular, the alternative would be to have one or

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.430
more global variables that refer to the instance.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.500
Once you've got global variables, they can be copied, and, and, and

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.600
referenced. Thereby leading to potential problems. Because singleton is a class,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.350
it can be subclassed, which gives you additional flexibility. And if you were so

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.720
inclined, you wanted to have a, a class in which there could be

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.540
exactly two instances or three instances or four instances, whatever.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.990
Okay, you could take the basic idea of the singleton and adjust it accordingly.
