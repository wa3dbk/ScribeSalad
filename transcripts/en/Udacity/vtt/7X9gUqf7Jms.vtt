00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.306
In this exercise, you'll start with a different procedural texture. It works

00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:07.062
fine, but I want you to know about an important debugging technique. Since you

00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:11.081
can't put break points inside a shader, it's hard to know what's going on. The

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:15.120
answer is to send various shader computations to the screen itself. In other

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.470
words, instead of putting your final result into GL_FRAGColor, put these other

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.150
intermediate values. In fact, you have three whole color channels to use and

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.560
view on the screen. Your task is to send the following program values, diffuse,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.945
ugain alpha, and attenuation to each of these channels. All three of these

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:35.008
values is in the proper range of zero to one, so need no adjustment. Here's

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.152
what things will look like when you're done. Under material control in the user

00:00:38.152 --> 00:00:42.046
interface is a slider called gain alpha. So, I think it will change the green

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:45.499
channel to match the value selected. One bit to notice in the code is that

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:49.570
there's a sub routine called compute bias. It's fine to use sub routines inside

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.509
shaders, and they have a C language type of interface.
