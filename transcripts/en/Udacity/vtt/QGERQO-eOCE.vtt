00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.770
Normally matrix order matters. If I rotate, then translate an object, I'll

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.340
usually get a different result than if I translate and then rotate. However,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.732
there are exceptions. Say I give you a bunch of the same type of transforms,

00:00:10.732 --> 00:00:14.095
such as four different translation matrices. If I mix up the order of the

00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:17.780
transforms, like on the second line here, would any object still be transformed

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.164
in exactly the same way by this new order, or does the ordering matter? So

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:24.620
that's your first question. Can I do a series of translations in any order and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.470
get the same result? Your second question is, what about a series of rotations?

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
Can I change the order and always get the same result? What about a series of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.259
scales, uniform or non-uniform? Does order matter? Finally what about a series

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:40.282
of rotations and translations all along the same axis? In other words, rotate

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:43.994
around z, translate around z, rotate some more around z, translate some more

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:47.266
around z. And so on. Can I change the order of those matrices and get the same

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.595
result? For all these questions ignore precision errors. Assume you have

00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:51.423
infinite precision.
