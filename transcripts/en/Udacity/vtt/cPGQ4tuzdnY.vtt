00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.213
So now, you understand regular expressions. You can interpret this pattern. The

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:07.989
one thing I haven't told you about that's important for interpreting this is

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:12.530
this dot here. This doesn't mean just a dot. Depending on the context, it often

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.738
means any character other than a new line. So, this regular expression here will

00:00:16.738 --> 00:00:21.730
match a whole bunch of strings. Any string that starts with a slash, followed by

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.430
any sequence of zero or more letters. So, it wouldn't match the slash by itself.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.422
It would match the slash, followed by any sequence of letters other than a new

00:00:31.422 --> 00:00:36.540
line. And when it does the matching, what's contained in the parenthesis will be

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.945
the first parameter. And what the application will do is call the get method

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:45.412
from this class, the parameters from the regular expression. In our case, that's

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:49.644
the query for our search. This input is a tuple that can contain any number of

00:00:49.644 --> 00:00:54.396
pairs, and each pair a regular expression followed by the name of the class that

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:59.105
will handle patterns that match that. And what the application server will do is

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:03.460
go through the patterns in order until it finds one that matches the query that

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.933
came in.
