00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.910
For computer vision object recognition,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.230
we're inherently interested in
finding objects in images, okay?

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.138
And that finding means
essentially two parts.

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:12.403
There's sometimes one.

00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:15.690
There's this notion of detection and
labeling, right?

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.230
So here in this picture of you know,
person standing next to a car,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.610
I have to not only sort of tell you
what's in it, I have to say oh okay,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.590
over here and I'll draw a box because
a lot of these things are Windows based.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.110
Saying okay, that's the car and
by the way over here, that's the person.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.098
So in general that's
what you have to do.

00:00:34.098 --> 00:00:37.270
And the, sort of the most common
approach to doing that is referred to as

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.440
windowing methods.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.040
All right?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.010
So there are lots of different
ways of thinking about Windows.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.080
We can start by thinking about
sort of whole images, right.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.670
So, here I have a picture of a couple
of training examples of koalas and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.880
a couple of training examples of pandas.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.130
This slide borrowed from
Kristen Grauman, Kristen has a thing for

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.560
cuddly folks with big ears.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.410
So if any of you are cuddly with big
ears, you can give Kristen a call.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.239
I hope Kristen's okay with that.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.243
So you know, clearly here I have my
koalas, we've talked about koalas before

00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:10.940
about how they're not bears, right,
that koalas are these things.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.710
And here we have pandas,
which are bears but are just mean.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.478
Anyway, and we'd like to do is we'd like
to somehow learn a way of discriminating

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.720
between them and say, you know,
which ones are which.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.620
So, one way of doing this would
be to just build some sort of

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.710
a holistic description
of the entire picture,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.690
with the assumption, we'll get to this
part later, that the picture thing that

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.730
I'm looking at is mostly the koala,
or mostly the panda.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.410
So what would be the simplest
possible description?

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.840
Well here's one.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.450
How about I just build
a histogram of the pixel colors?

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.540
Now, I'm showing it here in a single
image so it's, it's black and white.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.410
You can do this in R, G, and B, and

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.610
have, you'd essentially
have three histograms.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.770
And you could imagine that basically,
you could try to determine that,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.240
you know, these things look kind of,
pretty much different than this, so

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.780
that might be a good descriptor to try
to find where the boundary might be.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.288
You might try something even simpler.

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:11.230
I don't know, if it's simp,
yeah, I guess it's simpler.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.260
It's not a very good idea.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.890
All right?

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.170
The same way we did in PCA,
you can take all the little pixels,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.100
put them in a great big vector space and
you could say, okay, here are a whole

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.980
bunch of koalas, here are a bunch
of pandas, find me the boundary.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.420
You know,
do you think that would work well, or

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.580
do you think that would not work well?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.757
What do you think Megan?
Do you think it would work well?

00:02:31.757 --> 00:02:33.145
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:38.284
&gt;&gt; No, okay, one of the problems is,
you know, if I shift the picture just

00:02:38.284 --> 00:02:43.114
a little bit, all those pixels move
around in that feature vector.

00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:47.207
So a small change in the image is going
to give me a large change in my feature

00:02:47.207 --> 00:02:50.971
vector, which is not something you
want to have if you're going to have

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:55.020
a good ability to discriminate
between them, so that won't work.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.820
And what about the color thing well,
you think if I just did that color and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.456
intensity thing,
that would work pretty well?

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:00.042
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:00.820
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.480
Okay, look.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.423
Suppose I make it brighter today or

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:08.490
there's a shadow being cast upon
the thing etcetera, whatever.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.500
I get, you know,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.258
major variations in sort of the
distribution of the intensities, okay.

00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:18.650
Do you remember when we were talking
about trying to do tracking or

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.880
trying to find things you know, motion.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.680
We were looking for
what were called interest points.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.840
I hope you remember that, okay?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.980
And if you remember interest points,
house features, those kind of things,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.580
they were based on the idea of places
where you had high gradients, okay.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.280
In particular, those were where you
had variations in the direction of

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.690
the gradients as well, and the idea
was that gradients corners were quite

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.530
robust with respect to
changes in illumination.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.780
So if we take our koalas and our pandas,
we can consider sort of edges, contour.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.580
The idea of these intensity gradients,
right?

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.265
Those things tend to sort of stay
where they are, in terms of, you know,

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:57.015
if I change the intensity.

00:03:57.015 --> 00:03:57.525
All right.

00:03:57.525 --> 00:04:00.955
But of course we do have this problem
that is, I move the image just a little

00:04:00.955 --> 00:04:05.425
bit, I might get shifts in the location
of where those pixels are.

00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:09.975
So now, remember sift features, so we
did that whole thing with sift features,

00:04:09.975 --> 00:04:13.275
which took histograms
of the orientation,

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:15.860
and we computed these
little feature vectors.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.500
Right?

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.070
Well here, imagine taking your picture,
and you just cut it up into, say,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.450
four quadrants, right?

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.210
It's easier, right?

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.210
So, one, two, three, four.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.370
And I,
suppose I just compute some histograms

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.320
of the orientations of the gradients
in each of those regions.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.990
And I do that for
each of these pictures, okay?

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.750
It's robust with respect to illumination
changes because the gradient's there.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.880
Is it robust with respect to
small shifts in the picture?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.430
Megan, yes or no?

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.150
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.640
So the reason that it's robust with
respect to these small changes is that,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.850
you know, if I move this guy's
ear a little bit around.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.550
You know, a bunch of pixels.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.190
The distribution of the gradients is,

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.380
in that quadrant,
is going to remain about the same.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.100
That's why down here it
says locally orderless.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.270
What it means is that I'm not
worried about exactly which pixel

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.970
you're, you're in.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.110
I've got a general distribution in, in
one or two different areas of the image.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.610
Okay?
