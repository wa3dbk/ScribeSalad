00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.500
The solution here is pretty straightforward. First, we add a currSpriteName to

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.822
our EntityClass. If this is defined, we actually use this sprite name to call

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:12.330
the drawSprite function that we defined previously. This will take the sprite

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.760
name looked up the proper values in the

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.150
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.268
And then draw to the map. What we provide here is actually a position for where

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.425
this sprite should be drawn in the universe. Again, recall that we actually use

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.505
an offset of half size of the entity in order to center it around it's

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:30.560
location, rather than having the origin be the top left hand corner.
