00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.810
Now it's your turn to implement the functionality to

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.383
set and get announcements. So first you're going to need

00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:08.890
to define the announcement class. This is a very

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.720
simple class. It just basically has one field, message and

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.149
the constructor needs to take the message and put

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.560
it in the message field. We need this class,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.000
only because the end point functions must return an

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.240
object with a field, rather than a string. And you're

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.820
going to need to implement the SetAnnouncementServelet, you'll have

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.352
to implement the doGet method, you'll need to get the

00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:34.090
memcache service. You'll actually have to write the logic to

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.960
construct the announcement. And then you are going to need

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.845
to put the announcement in memcache, keyed off the recent

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:43.120
announcements key. And then do not forget to configure your

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.110
sever in web.xml. There is a skeleton implementation of SetAnnouncementServer

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.650
available to you. If you'd like to use it, and

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.100
you can find that in the Lesson 5 folder.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.960
You're also welcome to create it from scratch if

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.770
you want. And then in the ConferenceAPI class, you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.900
need to add the getAnnouncement function, which is an endpoint

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.260
function, which gets the announcement out of Memcache, and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.880
returns it, as an announcement object. And after you've tested

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.990
it and it's working on localhost, go ahead and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.890
deploy it to appspot. And then you go to cron/set_announcement

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.360
to actually run the setAnnouncement function and again,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300
the web browser is not going to change. Whatever it's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.390
showing when you go to this URL, it'll continue

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.550
to show after it executes the function. And in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.570
the APIs explorer, you can test the getAnnouncement function

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.765
to get the values of the announcement out of

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:37.586
memcache. And then use memcache viewer to check that

00:01:37.586 --> 00:01:42.080
your announcements are in memcache. Obviously they will be

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.930
if getAnnouncement works but it's good to practice using

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.150
the memcache viewer. And you can actually get the value

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.570
of the entry that's keyed by recent announcements. So

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920
go ahead and do that. And then when everything's working,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.580
on your app, deployed on appspot, go ahead and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.545
enter your app ID here. As you're testing the get

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:03.790
and setAnnouncement functionm you're going to obviously need to make

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.450
sure that you have some conferences where the seats available

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.650
is between 0 and 5. Otherwise, you won't get

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.980
any results and you won't get any announcement saved.
