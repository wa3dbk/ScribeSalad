00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.630
To call this function as a method,

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.610
we first need to add that function as a property of an object.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.670
In this case, we'll make it a property of the red object.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.220
Now, when I call the function,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.230
I can do it immediately after a dot access on that object.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.600
We already know what the positional parameters would be based on

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.070
the earlier example.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.980
But what about the this identifier?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.260
What object will it refer to?
