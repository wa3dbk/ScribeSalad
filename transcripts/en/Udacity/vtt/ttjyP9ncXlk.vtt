00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.390
Incremental planning is based on the idea that requirements are recorded

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.260
on story cards, sort of use cases or scenarios that the customer

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.450
provides. So the first step in incremental planning is to select

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.120
user stories for a given release, and which stories exactly to include

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.975
depends on the time available and on the priority. For example,

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.147
scenarios that we might want to realize right away because they are

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:22.110
particular important for the customer. After we select user stories for

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.200
the release, we break stories i to tasks. So what we do,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.260
we take the user stories and we identify specific development tasks

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.320
that we need to perform in order to realize these stories. Once

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.780
we know our tasks, we can plan our release. And at

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.050
that point, we can develop, integrate and test our code. And of

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.170
course, this is more kind of an iterative process right here,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.250
so we do this many times. When we're ready, when we accomplish

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.990
all of our tasks, all of our tests pass and we're happy,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.410
we release this software. At the point, the released software is evaluated

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.250
by us, by the customer, and we can reiterate. We can

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.360
continue the process, select more stories and continue it this way.
