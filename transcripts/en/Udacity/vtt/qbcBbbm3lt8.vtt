00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.407
Let's take a simple example that will be analogous to having a population with

00:00:05.407 --> 00:00:09.852
samples. Let's say you're gambling in Vegas. You're playing a gambling game

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:14.440
where you roll a tetrahedral die. You roll the die twice, and then, take the

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.664
average of the two rolls. To win, the average has to be at least three. What's

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:24.024
the probability that the average of your two rolls will be at least three? Just

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.193
take a guess.
