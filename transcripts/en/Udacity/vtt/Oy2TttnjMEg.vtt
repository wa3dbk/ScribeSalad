00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.980
While we're looking at the person class, we didn't implement the

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.130
unfriend method when we refactored our code. But now you know how

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.120
to remove items from an array list. So let me see. If

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.740
I want to remove a person, nonfriend. what if I try getting

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.350
the name of nonfriend, going through the list to find its index,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.900
and then removing that index? Is there anything wrong with this? Refactoring

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.850
to save an array list of the friends names was a step

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.390
in the right direction, but not enough. If I have two friends

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.440
with the same name, I wouldn't know which one to remove. In

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.500
fact, I can't even tell if I have the same friend in

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.250
here twice right now. I shouldn't just be storing a list of

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.280
the friends' names, I should be storing a list of the person

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.300
object associated with each friend. So let's refactor again I'll make my

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.630
ArrayList of String that I called friends before into an ArrayList of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.080
Person. Now I'll have to fix the way I initialize it in

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.590
the constructor. And let's look at that implementation of the getFriends method

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.470
with the separator. Now I need to actually get the name

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.790
out of the friend stored at this position. I'll show you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.920
what happens if I don't do that. Whenever I try to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.000
print out the result of getFriends, instead of printing the person's name,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.040
it's printing the class, and this weird jumble of symbols. Right

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.280
now, the array list to string method doesn't know how to make

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.320
a string representation of a person. So it just prints the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.830
reference. These symbols make sense to the computer, but not to people.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.780
So to avoid that mess, in the getFriends

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.280
method, I'll get the name from the friend, and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.240
add that And I'll do it in both

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.480
spots. Can you finish the rest of this refactoring?
