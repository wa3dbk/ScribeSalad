00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.080
It is often useful to look at specific problem domains,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.880
both to see how we can apply current theories of chronological reasoning to them

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.910
and also to see how we can use those problem domains to build new theories of

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.360
chronological reasoning. So let us turn now to the domain of design. In design,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.320
there is a new movement that is sometimes called biologically inspired design,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.440
or biomimicry. This movement is pulled by the need for

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.790
environmental sustainability and is pushed by the desire for creativity and

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.084
innovation and design. On the top left here is a picture of

00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:39.430
the Shinkansen 500 train in Japan. This is a bullet train. It's called a bullet

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.200
train because of the shape of its nose. This particular shape is inspired by

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.494
the shape of the beak of the Kingfisher. The story goes something like this.

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:51.890
Japanese railway engineers were interested in building faster trains.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.570
However, they had a problem, these trains had to go through tunnels. And

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.180
as they went through tunnels, they created shock waves, which created a lot of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.000
noise, bothering the neighbors. The shock wave was created because outside

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.200
the tunnel and inside the tunnel were two different mediums. By serendipity,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.770
the railway engineers looked at how the Kingfisher goes from the medium of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.430
air into a medium of water, dips its beak and catches its prey.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.728
The shape of its nose allows us to create a smaller shock wave.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.873
We use the same principle to create the design of the nose of the bullet train.

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:31.824
Shinkansen 500 travels faster than previous trains and

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:37.760
also makes less noise than previous trains, mostly because of the nose shape.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.970
Another example often cited in biomimicry is the example of a Mercedes Benz box

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.490
car, designed by inspiration to the Boxfish. Notice as biological

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.710
inspired design entails analogical reasoning. There's a target problem.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.881
There's a source case. There is cross-domain analogical transfer.
