00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.940
Let's get back to calculating precision recalls and

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.370
F scores for the classifiers that we've built.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.010
If you look at this line of code, the classification report class from

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.890
psychic learn gives us a very nice summary of all these metrics.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.780
Let's run this piece of code.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.830
For each of the classifiers.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.570
You will get values for precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.780
The support column, contains the total number of actual positives and

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.000
negatives in the test set.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.390
The next line of code gives you a count of the false and

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.570
true instances in each of the classifiers.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.575
We can also calculate the F1-score, F2-score, and F0.5 score.

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:47.210
Run the last block of code now.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.150
Now you have different values of the F1, F2 and F0.5 scores.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.270
Using these scores you can make a decision of which classifier will

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.140
work best for your needs.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.210
We have now come to the end of our map.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.150
We have now worked through several examples of the iteration between

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.720
questioning, modeling and the validation process of model building.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.340
Towards the end we changed the model and change our definition of the classes.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.190
We introduced to you different performance metrics like precision, recall,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.290
and F score.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.140
We showed you also how to choose a model based on these performance metrics.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.850
Hopefully you followed along and were inspired by all the lessons in this class

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.280
to continue learning about the various methods of model building and validation.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.020
Hope you enjoyed learning from us as much as we enjoyed making this class.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.240
Good luck and good bye.
