Before I give you the actual results of the experiment, Milgram surveyed

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:09.094
experts in the area such as psychiatrists. And asked them to predict how many

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:14.312
people would go up to 450 volts. He found from his research that 30% of the

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:20.266
people thought the teacher would administer a shock as high as 150 volts. Less

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:25.040
than 4% of the experts thought that the teacher would deliver a shock at 300

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.950
volts. And only one person in a 1,000 would go all the way to 450 volts.
