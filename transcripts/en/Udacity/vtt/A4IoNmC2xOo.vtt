00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.326
So here are your answers. Please note which of these expressions allow for a and

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:08.507
b to be equal, and which ones don't. Know that the two inequalities that do not

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.155
allow the possibility of equality between a and b, are the two strict

00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:16.170
inequalities, where inclusion is not allowed. So you would use the round

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.432
parenthesis on the number line if we were to indicate these.
