00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.090
Recall that the effect of running any function with the keyword new is that

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.710
that functions runs as if it had a bit of extra code in it.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.960
Particularly, it's going to set the keyword this to equal some

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.320
brand newly created object.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.970
And just because we ran the Van function with the keyword new and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.150
created another different object, does not mean that the other function is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.530
going to run with that same object as it's context.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.250
These are two different object.create statments that are being inserted into two

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.759
different functions as a result of two different appearances of the keyword new.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.440
In the diagram this would mean that any time you run the Van function with or

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.450
without the key word new, it would have the effect of building a brand new

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.420
object, that delegates to the constructor of the car class.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.390
If your running the Van function with the key word new to begin with,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.630
then you've already got a brand new object and you don't need a second one.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.970
Sometimes people try to solve this by assigning the result of the new

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.330
Car invocation, this object that gets created during the Car constructor,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.380
assigning to the local keyword this.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.370
But only is it disallowed to assign to the keyword this at all in your own code,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.810
even thought the interpreter is allowed to do such things,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.290
it doesn't solve the fact that you wind up having two different object,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.510
one of which you would be apparently throwing away.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.210
So this solution just doesn't work.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.150
Simple enough.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.100
What if we were to call the Car function without the keyword new?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.230
Perhaps that would have the effect of simply running the Car function in

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.970
the context that we wanted.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.140
Unfortunately, this doesn't work either.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.000
In this situation, what would you expect the keyword this from within

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.050
the Car function to be referring to as a result of being evoked on this line?
