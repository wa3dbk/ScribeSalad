00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.990
You had to use the T table for this and the degrees of freedom is 23 and the t

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.034
critical value is 2.069. This is because we're going a nondirectional test. In

00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:17.745
other words, our alternative hypothesis is this one. So we'll have 2.5% in each

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:22.808
tale. With 23 degrees of freedom. Out t statistic is greater than this,

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:28.104
therefore there is evidence to reject the null. Meaning that there is evidence

00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:33.066
of a significant relationship between x and y in the population. The observed

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.450
relationship is not likely due to sampling error.
