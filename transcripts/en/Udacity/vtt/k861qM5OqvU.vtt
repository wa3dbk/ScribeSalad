00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
So here's what we want to do, we want to go through

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.770
all the pages in the graph. So, we'll call them nodes

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.370
this time, we can't use page again, because we already used

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.370
page up here. So we're going to go through each page in

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.059
the graph, giving it the name node. And for each node,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.600
now what we need to do, is check whether that page

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.720
links to this one. So we're going to look in graph index

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.080
node, that's going to get us the list of all the pages

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.130
that node links to. If page is in that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.970
list, well that means that node links to page.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.490
So that means that we should add to newrank,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.189
based on the rank of this node. So that's what

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:40.834
we're going to do. We're going to add to newrank, and

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:43.480
the new value is going to be the old value,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.380
we are summing into the value of newrank. We're going to

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.130
multiply by d, that's our damping factor. And, the value

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.850
that we're going to use here, is the page rank of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.190
the node. Remember, it's the node that links to this node

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.062
that we care about, so we're getting the rank of

00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:02.100
the page. What we want to do, is divide that by the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.450
number of outlinks from that page, and that's important,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.000
that means that each, a page with many links, the value

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.140
of each link is less. We need to divide that by

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.050
the length of that list, which is what we get by

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.000
looking at graph index node. So, that's all we need.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.220
We are going to update the newrank. We are going through all

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.070
the nodes in the graph. We are finding all the nodes

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.460
that link to this one, and we are updating our rank

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.180
using the formula to get that. And at the end, we're

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.190
returning the ranks. So let's try that in the Python Interpreter.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.180
We have the code that we just wrote for compute_ranks. We're

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.110
going to use crawl_web passing in the example site, assigning the outputs

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.890
to the variable index, which is the index and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.726
graph. And then we're passing in graph to compute_ranks, storing

00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:49.270
the result in the variable ranks. And we can

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.820
print out the result in ranks, to see the page

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.970
ranks. So, here's what we get. So we get

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.960
a dictionary. For each URL that we crawled, we have

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.134
an entry where we have the URL, followed by

00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:06.150
each page rank as the value. So let's see if

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.130
the ranks that we get make sense. So, going

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.950
back to our example site, we have the page

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.680
Kathleen that has two links going into it. We

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.900
have the page Nickel. That has three links going

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.890
into it. If we just did simple link counting,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.160
well then, Nickel should be more popular than Kathleen. If

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.950
we look at the page ranks, well the page

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.718
rank for Nickel is 0.097. The page rank for Kathleen,

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:35.360
is 0.11. So the page rank is actually higher,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.380
for the page that only has two incoming links. And

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.700
the reason for that is, well, even though it only

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.890
has two incoming links, the links that are coming into

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.480
the page, are from popular pages. It's coming in from

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.050
the index page, and it's coming in from the very

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.200
popular Nickel page. So that's why the page rank of

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.690
Kathleen is actually higher than the page rank of Nickel.
