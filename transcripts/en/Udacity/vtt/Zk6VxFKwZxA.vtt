00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.390
This second choice is correct. If pandas all have about the same lifetime, then

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.448
they'll die off at a constant rate, not at a constant number per year. That

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:13.810
means that the higher the population. The more deaths there will be, because a

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.108
certain percent approximately, will die each year. As the population shrinks,

00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:20.649
there will be fewer pandas to die.
