00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.930
Let's look at our instruction scheduling quiz solution. As is

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.130
this takes one cycle to do the load. If the load

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.470
latency was one cycle, then the add could happen the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.580
next cycle, but because the load takes two cycles, the add

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.704
can only happen in cycle three. So, we have one

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:19.645
cycle three. The add takes only one cycle so the store

00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:22.730
can proceed. Then we can do the load, it doesn't depend

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.570
on anything so we can do the load in cycle five.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.194
The add however can now happen only in cycle seven

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:31.250
and finally the store happens in cycle eight. So as

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.920
is, this executes in eight cycles. The question is now

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.290
can we schedule this better to avoid some of these

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.680
stalls? And we had a stall here and here. To

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.190
avoid a stall here we need to place between the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.690
load and the add an instruction that can be done

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.710
here without violating dependencies. We can see that this load

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.800
here doesn't depend on any of the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.910
previous three instructions, except that we will destroy

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.330
R1 if we move that instruction here. So the correct solution to this is we will

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.670
move the load there, but we will rename

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.400
our R1 into something else. So the program

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.810
becomes now, load word R1 zero of R2 as before. Now we move the other load

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.580
there, put the result in some R10, let's say.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.460
Now we can do this add because in the third

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.421
cycle we can do it. Now that we have done

00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:27.941
this add we can actually do this the load has

00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:30.524
already happened, we are now in the second cycle

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.900
since then. So the second add can happen. The add

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.292
was using R1 now we have to use R10. Next,

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:41.180
we will do our store and if last remaining store.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.770
As you can see, now we have a processor where

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.570
whenever we need two cycles for the load there is

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.440
something in between the load and the use of it's

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.408
result. Here R1 is loaded, we then don't use R1 and

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:57.180
then we add to it. And here R10 is loaded

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.910
and then we don't do anything with R10 and then we

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.690
add to it. So this can be done in six

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.780
cycles, eliminating both of the stalled cycles that we previously had.
