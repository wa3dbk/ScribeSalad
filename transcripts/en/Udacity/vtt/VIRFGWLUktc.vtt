If you remember from the lesson on learning, we talked with Dr. Zeligs. She

00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:08.686
took some time out to talk with us about animals and personalities. So before I

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:11.502
move forward, let's take a look at what she had to say about the personalities

00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:16.224
of some of the animals that she's worked with. So some people are surprised to

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:19.302
know that animals have distinct personalities. And you have a ton of experience

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:21.798
with animals, so can you tell us a little bit about your experience with their

00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:26.582
personalities? Now, what's amazing is animals run the same gambit of

00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:31.811
personalities as you see with human beings. You have animals who are really

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:35.764
excited and engaged and task-driven. You have animals who are really

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:39.537
relaxation-driven, who like to sit back and enjoy and be quiet. You know, what

00:00:39.537 --> 00:00:46.934
motivates someone runs across the gambit of things. So some are, are motivated

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:52.170
by curiosity and some are motivated by food and some are motivated by activity.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.394
And all of these things make up some of what inspires, and then what makes up

00:00:55.394 --> 00:00:59.800
their personality, what, what attracts their attention. And what kinds of

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.465
things they choose to engage in. So Sharkie, the sea lion is one of the most

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:11.486
focused working women I have ever met in my life. And she would like to just

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:17.615
have her job going on 12 to 14 hours a day. And as long as we could focus on

00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:22.798
making sure she's a star 12 to 14 hour, she's a diva. That, that's her, her the

00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:27.341
best life in the world for her. Callie on the other hand is a little bit more

00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:32.610
cuddly, she's a little bit more playful. She's not so much about needing to do

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.195
a task as she is just being. She's got that relationship thing. She really

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:41.490
wants to be with her best friends. And that's kind of what motivates her.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.194
&gt;&gt; What kind of things do they do when, like, if Sharkie is not working. What does

00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:48.676
she do when she wants to be working? Like, does she try to get your attention,

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:49.280
or.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.587
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Sharkie will, will do all kinds of behaviors to try to get your

00:01:53.587 --> 00:01:58.132
attention. And she'll also take out her frustration on her environment when

00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:01.964
it's not going her way. She's got that real diva thing, you know? So she'll

00:02:01.964 --> 00:02:06.132
take her toys, and beat them side to side. Darnit, darnit, why isn't it my turn

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:10.238
to be paid attention to. She'll give herself a job by swimming really

00:02:10.238 --> 00:02:13.694
frantically or doing spectacular jumps or, you know, trying to keep herself

00:02:13.694 --> 00:02:18.457
busy. She's definitely not a couch potato animal and then other the other hand,

00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:23.397
I've known loads of animals that sit back and relax and chill out when. When

00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:26.320
it's not their turn, they're perfectly fine with that.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.442
&gt;&gt; How about any other types of animals other than sea lions?

00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:32.170
&gt;&gt; It's the same. I mean I can't say I've ever worked with an amoeba but even the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.509
quote unquote lesser animals that I work with, even fish I have trained have

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:40.341
distinct personalities. Some of them want to hover over here and like this kind

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:43.764
of security and feel like they need security. And others of them are

00:02:43.764 --> 00:02:48.840
extroverted. And are very attentive and curious. And that's, that's with

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.724
monkeys, with tortoises with otters, with everything that you can imagine. They

00:02:53.724 --> 00:02:57.420
have just a different natural set of ways of interacting with their

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.314
environment. And you see it in terms of whether they act out in their

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:06.523
environment or whether they're more wary. How playful they are. How active they

00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:10.780
are. What kinds of things they like and don't like. So where you see the most

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.749
extreme of personality is the long lived super social animals. And so that's

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:20.165
because natural history sort of require the most complexity in order to work

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:26.374
with their world. Their broad social world is, is a big component of it. So

00:03:26.374 --> 00:03:31.650
that's where you see the, just the most diversity of it. Less, less programming

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.980
and more learning from the environment is what's, what's going on. You see, the

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.319
sort of, least personality in the animals that have a much more fixed action

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.867
pattern type of life history. So, a snake or a lesser bird. But even in those

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:49.151
you'll see preferences and attitudes towards collecting prey you know, certain

00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:54.630
snakes will need it to move and other snakes don't really care. And you know

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.680
and what they like the warm rock but as long as it's high up here or that, you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.890
know. So there's, there's all of that and it goes across the animal spectrum

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.999
for sure.
