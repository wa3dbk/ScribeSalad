00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The best answer is to run scatterplots,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and the reason is I taught you that you should always look at the data first

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
before doing anything with the data.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So, here is the scatterplot for those data points.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's really interesting. If I look at this, it looks like almost all the guesses are the same.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That's the case until I realize that my vertical axis goes from 1e22

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
all the way down to -1e22.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Obviously there are outliers in that data.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This plot makes it completely obvious to me that this isn't good data.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's take this plot away, and let's look at the data.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As before, we notice that there are these extreme cases

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where we have 1E+22--the same over here.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I have to ask myself how to remove outliers.
