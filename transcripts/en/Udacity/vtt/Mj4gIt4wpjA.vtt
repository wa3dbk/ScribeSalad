00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.583
So first, let's group our x terms. We subtract 14 from both sides to obtain 4x

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:13.549
squared plus 16x equals y minus 14, then we complete the square. First, we have

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.789
to obtain the coefficient of 4 so that we can add 4 times 4 to both sides and

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.118
simplify. Giving us a solution of 4 times the quantity x plus 2 quantity squared

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:27.354
equals y plus 2.
