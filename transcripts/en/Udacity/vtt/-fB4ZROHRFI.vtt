00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.689
To subtract the second rational expression we really want to add the opposite.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.045
We want to distribute our subtraction sign to each term in the numerator which

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:13.110
gives us a negative 1. Now we factor each denominator and try to find the lowest

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.466
common denominator between the two fractions. The lowest common denominator is x

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:22.551
minus 1 times x minus 1 times x plus 1. We know this since these two

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:26.519
denominators share a common factor of x minus 1. The other factor for this

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.164
denominator is x minus 1. And the other factor for this denominator is x plus 1.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:34.766
We multiply each fraction by the missing factors of the lowest common

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:40.464
denominator. For the first fraction, we distribute 6x to the quantity x plus 1.

00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:46.770
We'll get 6x squared plus 6x. For this second fraction, we'll have negative 1

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.087
times the quantity x minus 1. We really just changed these two signs. So we'll

00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:55.930
have negative x plus 1. Now that we have two fractions with common denominators

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.132
We can add the numerators together. We just add the like terms. When we add the

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:06.840
like terms of 6x and negative x together we'll get 6x squared plus 5x plus 1.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.430
Now remember, we have a new numerator here. And let's see if we can factor it.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.805
We want factors of positive 6 that's sum to 5. Well yes that would be 3 and 2.

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:21.973
This would be the factored form if we use factoring by grouping. But notice that

00:01:21.973 --> 00:01:26.448
this doesn't help us out. None of these factors appears in our denominator. We

00:01:26.448 --> 00:01:31.032
can't simply any more. I final answer would be 6 x squared plus 5 x plus 1.

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:34.493
Divided by the factors of this denominator.
