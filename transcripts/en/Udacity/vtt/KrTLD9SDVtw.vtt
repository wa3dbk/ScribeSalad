00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.283
Hello. Welcome to our unit on inheritance. Also known as, what not to do when

00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:08.074
you are chased by a bear. So, recall the question we ended the last unit with,

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.448
which is what was up with these magic methods? And we saw two of them, init and

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:14.628
str, when they're missing, when we didn't define them in the class. It seemed

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:17.380
like they were still there. That would make them pretty magical. They're not

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.466
really that magical. So, let me show you what's going on. So, let me show you

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:24.216
that they're actually there. So, we're going to define a totally empty class. No

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:28.595
attributes, no definitions at all. And I'm going to create an instance of that

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:33.480
class. And we saw that, that instance has an str attribute and it's a method.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.217
And we can invoke that str method and we get the string. Not a very interesting

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:40.490
one, but we do get a string back. And we can see using dir, which is an

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.270
operation that takes any object and gives us a list of attributes to find for

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.203
that object. That's there's actually a whole bunch of attributes to find for

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:51.965
this empty class already. And we see that these include the str attribute, which

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:55.398
turns it into a string, as well as the init attribute, which initializes it.

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:59.776
What's going on here is what we call inheritance, which is a way to reuse

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:04.040
definitions from other classes when we define new classes. We'll get to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.560
inheritance soon, as well as, the mystery of where these extra magic methods

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.086
came from. Before getting to inheritance, I want to cover three other aspects of

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:14.362
Python that you may not have seen before, that we haven't yet covered in this

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:18.380
class. That's format strings, named arguments, and default parameters. If you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.630
already feel comfortable with those things, feel free to skip ahead to where I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.083
start talking about inheritance.
