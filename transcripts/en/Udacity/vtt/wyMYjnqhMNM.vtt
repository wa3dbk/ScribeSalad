00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.990
When you go to the interview,
especially for Android positions,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.530
I think it's important to have, and

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.990
spend some effort in putting together
a portfolio of what you built.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.960
A lot of times people just refer
you to their GitHub account, and

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.600
they'll have a ton of repose.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.810
None of them have been touched,
or they're not complete.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.560
So, I think, when you structure it,
structure it, maybe, if you can,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.410
build a portfolio page of apps that
you've developed in your GitHub page,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.350
think of them the same way.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.700
So put in screenshots.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.220
Not everyone's going to build your apps.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.790
But people are going
to look at your code.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.840
So put in some description of,
in the read me, so that people can see

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.720
initially of what the app does,
what it was targeted, why you built it.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.010
I think those are all important things.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.000
Because when I get a developer, one of
the first things I do after I talk to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.870
them or even beforehand is look at their
GitHub page and look at their code,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.240
because I think that gives you
a sense of, they have no restrictions.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.740
This is how they would
program on their own and

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.700
the quality of the code they produce.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.780
When you're interviewing for
a job, they're also looking for

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.610
a company that's right fit for you.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.030
So I think it's important and depending
on the company, they might be willing or

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.340
not willing to do it.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.510
But getting a sense of
the culture is important, and

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.060
also if you can,
getting a sense of the code base.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.790
If you can look at the code and kind of
see how developers are developing within

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.120
that company, and if you think it's
something where it looks promising that

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.630
you could learn a great deal from,
you should definitely go into it.
