00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280
There's an old saying in AI,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.210
which goes like, if you have the right knowledge representation,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.990
problem solving becomes very easy. Let's see whether that also works here.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.410
We now have a knowledge representation for this problem of guards and prisoners.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.230
Does this knowledge representation immediately afford effective problem solving?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.530
So, here we are in the first node, the first state. There are three guards and

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.650
three prisoners in the boat, all in the left-hand side. Let us see what moves

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.280
are possible from this initial state. Now, using this representation, we can

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.430
quickly figure out that there are five possible moves from the initial state.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.590
And the first move, we move only guard to the right. On the second move,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.800
we move a guard and a prisoner to the right. In the third move, we can move two

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.460
guards, or two prisoners. Or, in the fifth move, just one prisoner to the right.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.290
Five possible moves. Of course, we know that some of these moves are illegal and

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.510
some of them are likely to be not very productive. Will the semantic network

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.950
allow us to make inferences about which moves are productive and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.450
which moves are not productive? Let's see further. So, let's look at

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.090
the legal moves first. So we can immediately make out from this representation,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.970
that the first move is not legal because we are not allowed to

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.750
have more prisoners than guards on one side, of the river.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.460
Similarly, we know that the third move is illegal for the same reason.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.810
So, we can immediately rule out the first and the third moves. The fifth move,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.370
too, can be ruled out. Let's see how. We have one prisoner on the other side.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.350
But the only way to go back would be to take the prisoner to the,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.990
back to the previous side. And if we do that, we reach the initial state.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.580
So we did not make any forward progress. Therefore, we can rule out this move

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.110
as well. This leaves us with two possible moves that are both legal and

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.060
productive. The, we have already removed the moves that were not legal and

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.440
not productive. Later, we will see how AI programs can use various

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.419
methods to figure out what moves are productive and what moves are unproductive.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.290
For the time being, let's go along with our problem solving.
