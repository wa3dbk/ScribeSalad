Since on our table, x varies from negative 3 to 3, we need to make sure that

00:00:04.807 --> 00:00:09.900
whatever we pick over here contains all those values. 0 to 10 and negative 10 to

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:14.933
0 are both out, and although negative 20 to 10 does contain all of these values,

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:20.016
it's way bigger than this set, so I think the best choice is from negative 5 to

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:25.015
5. Our y values range from negative 14 to 4, which makes negative 20 to 10 the

00:00:25.027 --> 00:00:26.844
only choice that works for y.
