00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.400
I turns out that this i has an interesting pattern to it. We can simply any

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.332
power of i by following this pattern. First, we need to remember that i equals

00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:14.580
the square root of negative 1. This means if we square i, we also square the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.940
square root of negative 1. So i squared would equal negative 1. To find the

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.435
value of i cubed, we multiply i squared by i. Since the value of i squared is

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:30.740
negative 1, we simply have negative 1 times i, or negative i. So we know i

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.226
cubed really simplifies to negative i. So let's use a similar approach to find

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:40.447
i to the 4th. We'll split it up into two powers of i that we know, i squared

00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:46.977
and i squared. Since i squared equals negative 1, we have negative 1 twice.

00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:52.696
Negative 1 times negative 1 equals positive 1. So i to the 4th will just

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:57.409
simplify to positive 1. Let's see if you can extend our pattern. What do you

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.896
think i to the 5th, i to the 6th, i to the 7th, and i to the 8th would be? If

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.680
you get the square root of negative 1, I want you to just enter i for your

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.759
answer. And as a hint to get you started, you can rewrite i to the 5th as i to

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.252
the 4th times i. Think about if you can replace any of these values.
