00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
So as we said, understanding these 3 components of value proposition

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.910
work together with understanding the 3 components of customer segments.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.129
And in value proposition, the goal of this is to find out that minimum viable product.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.450
And in customer segments, the goal is to understand in detail

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.920
the customer archetype or persona.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.670
And again, this equals product market fit.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.400
I can't emphasize enough that the business model canvas is just a start.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.860
It's great to strategize and think about who customer segments are

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.930
and value proposition and channel,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.820
but remember all you're doing is writing down hypotheses.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.810
Your job is to turn those hypotheses into facts.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.800
And there are no facts inside your building.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.720
So your job is to get outside and test them personally in a physical channel

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.880
by talking to hundreds of customers;

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.590
in a Web and mobile channel by talking to thousands virtually and some portion physically.

00:01:01.590 --> 99:59:59.000
You need to watch people's pupils dilate when they actually see and like your product.
