00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's first briefly review
the WiFi technology.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.480
A typical use of WiFi is to
allow personal computers or

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.330
devices enabled with WiFi
in a locale such as a home

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.710
to access the Internet through
the access point, or AP.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.210
The AP connects to these
devices wirelessly.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.080
And connects to the Internet
through physical wiring.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.240
Such as to a router provided by
the Internet service provider.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.880
Devices in a locale can also connect to
each other wirelessly through the AP.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.285
In wireless networking, data is not
transmitted via physical wiring.

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:44.320
Instead data is transmitted in
air which is an open medium.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.090
In other words, there is no inherent
physical protection of communications.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.550
Also since there's no hard wiring
connecting two devices for

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.170
direct communications,
in wireless networking,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.510
communication between two devices is
achieved by one device broadcasting and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.890
the other device listening
to the broadcast.
