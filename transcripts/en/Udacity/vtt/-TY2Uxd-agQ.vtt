00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.690
All right,
let's see what we're dealing with.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.830
Now, I love the blue and
the minimalist approach.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.390
Points for guessing my favorite color,
but I feel like it could do a bit more.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.860
There aren't really any animations or
magic moments or anything.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.010
Oh, but there's this notification.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.420
That'll be handy and
really helps add to the experience.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.510
Although, I'd love to see a widget or
something else to allow me to set up

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.740
a permanent weather display
that fits with my device.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.040
But this doesn't look like what
the weather outside looks like.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.120
I wonder how to change that.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.610
Of course, it would be nice if I
didn't need to do this manually.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.210
Remember that the initial experience is
often the turning point between someone

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.260
uninstalling an app and
using it every day.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.980
Now let's see what the tablet
version looks like.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.390
Mm-mm.
There's nothing here.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.730
What's going on?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.290
Oh, I'm not on Wi-Fi.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.720
Sure would have been nice to know I
needed an internet connection and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.890
not that the app was broken.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.120
Okay.
Much better.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.210
And I like the landscape layout,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.130
with the weather details
right next to the list.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.720
Really great use of
the extra space here.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.240
Oh lord.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.510
Looks like there's a few
edge cases they overlooked.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.760
It means, Wednesday comes
around every week, after all.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.320
It really is important to keep in mind
the huge variety of Android devices when

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.760
designing your app.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.150
Well, I'll need to come
up with a plan of attack.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.870
I'll check with Ian, and
between the two of us,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.550
I'll bet we can settle on the core
of what needs to improve.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.340
But I challenge you to take
a look at Sunshine, and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.300
make a short list of what you think
should be done before launching the app.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.030
Discuss your ideas in the student
forum and take note of where your list

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.990
intersects with ours as you
move through the course.
