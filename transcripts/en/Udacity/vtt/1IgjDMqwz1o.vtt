So, let's get some practice filtering. And the data

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.590
set we're going to work, with [INAUDIBLE] comes from your

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.340
fellow classmates. It's our forum data. Now, forum posts, in

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.020
our forums can be long. Or they can be very

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.040
short. Or maybe, they're somewhere in the middle. And for

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.860
this problem, we don't care about the long posts. We're

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.610
in the medium ones. We want to filter just the very

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.530
short posts, the posts that are one sentence or less.
