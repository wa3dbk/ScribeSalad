00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.270
We are beginning a lesson on network security.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.750
let's first talk about why we need network security

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.600
in the first place. The Internet is actually subject

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.390
to a wide variety of attacks on various parts

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.500
of the infrastructure. One part of the infrastructure

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.720
that can be attacked is routing. So the internet's

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.530
routing protocol, the border gateway protocol, is notorious for

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.220
being susceptible to different kinds of attacks. For example,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.805
on April 8, 2010, China advertised about

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:33.870
50,000 blocks of IP addresses from 170 different

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.850
countries. The event lasted for about 20 minutes.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.050
In this particular case, the hijack appears to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.710
have been accidental. Because the prefixes were long

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.100
enough such that they didn't disrupt existing routes.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.550
But the fact that the route advertisements were

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.730
allowed to leak in the first place highlights

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.180
the vulnerability of the border gateway protocol.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.200
Effectively, the border gateway protocol. Essentially allows

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.340
any AS to advertise an IP prefix to a neighboring AS, and that AS will

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.630
typically just believe that route advertisement and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.870
advertise it to the rest of the

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.430
internet. These events that occur where an

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.740
AS advertises a prefix that it does not

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.740
own are called route highjacks. And they tend to occur more often than one might

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.930
expect. In addition to the event on April 8, 2010, another event in

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.610
2008 occurred where Pakistan hijacked the YouTube

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.660
prefixes, potentially as a botched attempt to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.460
block Youtube in the country following a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.000
government order. Unfortunately, the event resulted in disruption

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.140
of connectivity to YouTube for people all around the world. In January of

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.680
2006, ConEdison accidentally hijacked a lot of

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.270
transit networks, including level three Unet and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.560
several other large ISPs disrupting connectivity

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.590
to many customers. And on April 25th

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.020
in 1995, one of the more famous route hijack incidents was the AS7007 incident,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.240
where AS7007 advertised all of the IP prefixes on the entire internet. As

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.170
originating in its own AS, resulting in

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.360
disruption of connectivity to huge fractions of

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.090
the Internet. So we've surveyed some famous or, shall we say, notorious attacks

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.570
on Internet routing, but another part of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.170
the infrastructure that's vulnerable Is naming or

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.720
the DNS. One very popular and effective means of mounting an attack on the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.490
naming system is through something called reflection.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.110
DNS reflection is a way of generating

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.900
very large amounts of traffic targeted at

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.010
a victim. In an attack called Distributed

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.950
Denial of Service, or DDos attack. Another

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.420
type of attack on the naming system is

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.730
Phishing, whereby an attacker exploits the domain

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.490
name system in an attempt to trick a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.530
user into revealing personal information, such as passwords

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.450
on a rogue website. In general, denial of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.810
service attacks are extremely common and can be

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.970
mounted in a variety of different ways. DNS

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.940
reflection is just one way that distributed denial

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.630
of service attacks are mounted. We'll explore some

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.330
others later on in this lesson. It's worth asking why

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.390
the internet is so vulnerable to different kinds of attacks.
