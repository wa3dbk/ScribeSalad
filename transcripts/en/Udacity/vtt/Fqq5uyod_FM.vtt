00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.723
If we subtract 2x from both sides and 6 from both sides, then we'll have 0 on

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:11.045
the left, and x squared minus 4x minus 5 on the right. Great work if you found

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:14.595
this expression. Now, this might look a little funny to you, but I just

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:20.648
combined the subtraction in one step. I subtracted 2x and I subtracted 6. Keep

00:00:20.648 --> 00:00:24.011
in mind that we can do this so long as we perform the same operation on the

00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:26.619
left as we do on the right.
