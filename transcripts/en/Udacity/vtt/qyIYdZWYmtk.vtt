00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.100
We specified id as an integer.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.350
So, in our mapper we should
also specify the same thing.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.220
So, we have this ForeignKey relationship
between our address and our employee.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.260
So here,
in this lower case employee variable,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.070
we set its relationship to the actual
employee class we created.
