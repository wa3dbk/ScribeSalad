This lesson's about texture animation. When I hear the phrase texture

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.390
animation, it brings to mind 2 different ideas. The first is shown here, in a

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.250
tutorial by Lee Stemkoski. The idea is the same as a flip book, where you draw

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.798
a different image on each page, and then flip through them. The other form of

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:17.486
texture animation is where you move the texture by transforming the texture

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:21.370
coordinates, such as shown here. There's plenty of animation that can be done

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.984
without a motion capture studio or even a modeler. Remember that almost

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:27.416
anything you can set on a model, light or camera is something you can change in

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:31.866
the render loop. You can modify material, color and shininess, transparency and

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.180
visibility and just about everything else.
