00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.245
We can generalize compaction in the following way--compact is an operation that

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:12.060
allocates exactly 1 item in the output for each true input and 0 items in the output for each false input.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.033
This is useful, of course, in compact as a really common operation.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:19.355
But more generally we can do a compact-like operation

00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:24.057
where the number of output items can be computed dynamically for each input item.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:27.089
Let me offer a graphics example to show why this might be useful.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.334
The input to most real time computer graphics pipelines is a set of triangles.

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:34.700
Some of these triangles might appear on the screen and some might not.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.448
And so we generally test to see if each triangle is visible or not,

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:41.254
before we pass it down the pipeline for later processing.

00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:46.534
This is a compact operation--we compact an input stream of triangles, some of which are visible

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:53.108
and some are not, into a smaller output stream where all triangles in the output stream are visible.

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:57.112
And we know how to do this with compact. Now, here's the more complicated problem.

00:00:57.112 --> 00:01:01.958
What if a triangle intersects the boundary of the screen or window,

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:06.571
for example this triangle here, or this triangle here?

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.760
In this case we apply an operation called clipping,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.104
where we cut the triangle with the boundary, and then triangulate the resulting shape.

00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:18.547
So for this triangle, for instance, we're going to convert it to this triangle right here.

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:24.428
This triangle has left behind a trapezoid, and so we only want to deal with triangles.

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:29.720
So instead we triangulate this trapezoid and send 2 triangles down the pipe.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.771
Now we have a situation where we input a set of triangles,

00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:38.431
and each triangle can produce 0, 1, or possibly many output triangles.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.522
And we want to output the resulting triangles in a dense array.

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:47.186
Here's a good geometry quiz question for you that has really nothing to do with the course material,

00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:49.139
but it's a pretty cool question nevertheless.

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:54.708
What is the maximum number of triangles that can result from clipping a triangle with a rectangle?
