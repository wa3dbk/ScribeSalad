00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.820
All right. What you got?

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.740
&gt;&gt; So I look at this and believe it or not

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.440
I, I came to an answer by two completely different ways.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.680
&gt;&gt; Okay. And do they, do they agree?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.510
&gt;&gt; They, they happen to agree, but one of them

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.160
is kind of lame. It's sort of the thing that you

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.190
would do if you were doing the SAT or the GRE

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.690
and you wanted to quickly get a guess at the answer.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.168
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:25.810
&gt;&gt; And it's that k, very small k and very big k are kind of both easy.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.641
It's the one in the middle where it gets hard. And

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:30.790
so any function that depends on k directly, in a way

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.403
where as k gets bigger it gets harder, as k gets

00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:37.420
smaller, it gets easier, is probably not right. Which made me think

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.918
was probably n cubed. And so then I tried to think

00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:42.848
about how the algorithm worked. And so, the worst case way

00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:45.739
of thinking about the algorithm is at every single time you

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.900
have to figure out which two points are closest to one another.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.810
&gt;&gt; Alright, hang on a sec. So we're going

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:57.230
to repeat k times, and the hard case is when it's, like, n over twoish, right?

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.420
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.930
&gt;&gt; And what, what is it that we do at each step?

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.930
&gt;&gt; Well, we find the two closest points.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.069
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.220
&gt;&gt; Right, and that, and how long, and yeah, and how

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.970
long does that take, it's exactly, it's n squared. because you have

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.694
to do all possible combinations. It's a little better than n

00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:15.020
squared, right, it's, you know, but it's big O of n squared.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.850
&gt;&gt; Right, and it's possible

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.690
that if we store those distances really cleverly we can get it down a

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.600
bit more, but, yeah, n squared seems like a nice way to characterize it. So

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.360
don't we need to do some work to merge the clusters together so that

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.490
the next time through we get the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.590
right set of distances that we're looking through.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.510
&gt;&gt; We could do that and that would work fine and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.960
that's probably the right thing to do, but just kind of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.580
at a high level, what you just really want to do

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.920
is, you just want to find the closest two points that have

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.750
two different labels.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.620
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.290
&gt;&gt; So what I associate with every, with every

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.660
object x is the label that it currently has.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.070
&gt;&gt; So you're going to look at each pair. Ignore it if the, the labels

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.450
are the same, on both of the clusters that the two objects are in.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.153
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:55.153 --> 00:01:56.500
&gt;&gt; And otherwise find the minimum.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.370
&gt;&gt; Right. And what, and I can.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.840
&gt;&gt; That sort of works.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.170
&gt;&gt; And I could do that in time linear in the number of pairs.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.200
So it's still n squared, I don't have to sort or anything like that.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.900
&gt;&gt; True, though we could,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.290
it could be a little bit smarter to not

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.690
reconsider the same pairs over and over and over again.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.380
&gt;&gt; That's right, you could. If you could

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.295
use, you could probably use something fancy like

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:19.440
Fibonacci heaps, or hash tables or something. And

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.720
in fact, I know that there are people

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.140
who've gotten entire PhDs on clever ways of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.650
doing this without having to consider all points.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.640
By dividing points up into little boxes where

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.280
things tend to be closer to one another.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.900
Actually looks a lot, very hierarchical as well.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.560
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we do, we do, we do a, that

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.062
takes n squared time. How many times do we do a?

00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:42.190
&gt;&gt; Well, we do it about n times.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.050
&gt;&gt; Alright. So that gets us the n cubed.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.090
And is it, is it clear that the other

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.730
ones are definitely wrong? Well, since we can do

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.980
this in n squared time, and the number of

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.750
clusters can be large, the first one is a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.970
bad answer. The second one is a bad answer.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.540
How about the last one? Is it, is it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.500
possible that we could actually do this in linear time?

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.135
no. Well, for, for, for very small or very big k, maybe. Like, so k equals

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:06.760
2, yes, that's easy, that's linear, k equals

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.090
n, that's easy. because we started out that way.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.690
&gt;&gt; I see, but for in between k's.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.990
&gt;&gt; because you still have to find

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.250
the closest distance, and there's, you have to

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.870
find distances and the only way to do that is to consider all the distances.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.505
&gt;&gt; Yeah, at the very least the, the number of

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:22.510
inputs that you need to even sniff at is quadratic.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.885
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:23.800
&gt;&gt; Because the d can

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.800
be any kind of structure. So, yeah, okay.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800
So this is really the only answer that,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.880
that is even close. But I think it could come down a little bit from n cubed.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.350
&gt;&gt; Oh. I'm sure it could. I mean, because I just came

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.940
up with the silliest, the, the simplest algorithm that you could think

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.840
of that wasn't absolutely stupid. So I think that would. You could

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.750
certainly do better than n cubed. But not much better than n cubed.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.130
&gt;&gt; All right. End of quiz.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.080
&gt;&gt; Yay.
