00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.670
So, to start answering our question of who has more

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.960
friends, men or women, on average, let's take our histogram

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.730
and split it up into two histograms for males and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.640
females. We do this by adding a facet wrap as another

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.380
layer. This time, our facet wrap is going to take

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.240
a formula where we have the tilde sign and then

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
gender as our splitting variable, and when we run this

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.480
code as you might find out, we get something quite unexpected.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.570
We don't just have two histograms, we have three.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.940
One for females, one for males, and one for NA.
