00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The problem we're having here is that we're not taking care of the quotes in the HTML markup.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Actually, anything that's within these quotes in HTML markup should not end HTML markup.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In particular, not the greater sign in here, so we need to extend a program appropriately.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The idea was as follows--rather than having two states, one for regular text

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and one for HTML markup, we're going to have a third state,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which would handle anything that's within quotes.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Just as before, we start in a non-tag mode and when we see a less than sign, we go into tag mode.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is what we do when we possess this very input and we stay in this mode until we find a quote--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that's when we go in quote mode and we stay in quote mode until we find another quote.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That's when we go back into tag mode, which happens right here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
When we see the greater sign, we exit tag mode and we possess the individual characters,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and we add them to the output.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Thus our output should now become foo as expected.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The remaining tag is processed just as before.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In order to implement this, we're going to use two variables--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
one variable tag and one variable quote to indicate the three different states a program can be.
