00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.288
Your task in this problem is to write a regular polygon creator. A regular

00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:09.446
polygon is one that has equal angles and equal length sides. When you create the

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:13.602
polygon, sucessive points will be counter clockwise. Your job is to form the

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:17.598
minimum number of traingles that triangulates this surface. Your draw function

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:22.083
is called polygon draw function in the code. It takes as an input the number of

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:26.615
sides desired. I'll provide you the basic trigonometry function for generating

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:31.096
the polygons points. This code the produces x and y creates the polygons

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:36.610
vertices. For example when the loop variable point is at 0, the 2D point at x

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.965
and y is going to be the point 0,1. Your job is to save the vertices, then use

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:47.500
these vertices in a loop that generates the faces for the polygon. Here's what

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.953
your aiming for, a regular polygon centered around the origin.
