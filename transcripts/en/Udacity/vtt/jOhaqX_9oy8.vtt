00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.168
Welcome to Elementary Statistics.

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:04.078
We're really excited
to have you on board.

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:05.114
My name's Katie, and

00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:08.831
I'm the one who will be explaining most
of the concepts throughout this course.

00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:11.318
I'll also be doing a lot of drawing and

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:16.004
a lot of writing to help you understand
the content as much as possible.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.272
In each of the 16
lessons in this course,

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:21.306
you'll learn new methods to describe and
analyze data.

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:25.614
Each lesson builds on the concepts you
learned before, so as you progress

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:30.146
through the course, try to get a good
grasp of the material before moving on.

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:32.747
But if it turns out you need a review,
no big deal.

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:37.665
You can easily go back and re-watch
the videos and redo the exercises.

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.697
What do I mean by exercises?

00:00:39.697 --> 00:00:43.765
Each lesson consists of short
instructional videos where I explain

00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:46.345
cool stats stuff and
guide your thinking.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.622
But we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own.

00:00:48.622 --> 00:00:52.420
So instead of just telling you a fact or
formula, I'll ask a quiz.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.094
A quiz, or exercise, same thing,
is not there for us to judge you or

00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:58.655
to impact your grade.

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:01.460
It's there for your own benefit,
to make you think.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.443
At Udacity, we believe that the chance
to think about something from your own

00:01:05.443 --> 00:01:08.460
unique perspective is a powerful
learning opportunity.
