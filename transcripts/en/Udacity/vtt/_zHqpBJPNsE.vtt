00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.940
So that's all of the things that the keyword this doesn't refer to.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.480
What is it that the keyword this will refer to?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.990
Going back to our example of calling a function,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.470
we notice that there's a dot to the left of this example.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.030
When you notice a dot to the left of a function invocation,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.720
meaning it was looked up as a property of an object,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.690
you can look to the left of that dot and see what object it was looked up upon.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.490
The object that a function is looked up upon when it's being invoked,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.800
that object is what the keyword, this, will be bound to.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.640
I'm giving you an approximate definition that is useful to get you out of 90%

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.980
of situations, because of course,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.820
it may not be the case we use a dot to access this function.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.920
We may, for example, use brackets.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.770
And of course, in this example, it's also the case that,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.950
that object to the left of the dot is the very same one that it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.330
was defined originally to be a property of.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.880
The fact that it's defined up here is a coincidence.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.320
We could just as easily have called that same function as a property of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010
a different object provided it's stored as a method of that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.400
second object as well.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.030
In any case, it's not true that the object you

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.720
find a given function stored within will be what the keyword this refers to, nor

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.880
is it the case that an object, a function,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.320
was originally defined with is going to be what the keyword this refers to.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.530
In fact, it has everything to do with that call time dot and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.410
the object that we find to the left of it.
