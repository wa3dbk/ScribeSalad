00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's take a little bit different view of the same problem.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, what I want to do is draw a graph here, so in the level of code coverage

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with a random test cases are inducing on the system under test.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So again, we're testing a web browser, and on the x axis,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
this is going to be a little bit fuzzy unfortunately.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But what I want to show is how far into the web browser we execute.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Which is just checking, for example, if the incoming data is even valid HTTP.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Once we get valid HTTP, the browser is going to scan and make sure it got valid HTML.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's going to be doing lexical analysis and checking of HTML.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If the input fails to be rejected by this kind of code, it's going to go on the rendering engine

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and finally, it might have sort of some more advanced processing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is dealing with things like forms, cookies, scripting and such.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Okay so, we have this graph.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, now let's see what happens when we fuzz the web browser using totally random bits.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, what's kind of most likely happen is most of those bits that come in,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
are now even going to be valid HTTP responses.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, we're going to get coverage rapidly drops off

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and what's left is almost always going to fail somewhere else.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What we're going to see is, we're going to spend the bulk of our testing effort

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
rejecting random sequences of bits very early on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and very little of our testing effort, testing code here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Again, as I said, if that's what we're trying to do,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
if we really want to be stressing the early parts of the web browser code, then that's great.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And random testing is perfectly good at that, but on the other hand,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
if we are interested in is for the broad coverage of the software under test, then we're going to fail.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The red color indicates random bits.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The next thing we can do is we could go random input generator

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
totally respects the constraints of the HTTP protocol.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Furthermore, we can adapt it, so the text that it generates contains valid lexical elements of HTML.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That is to say it's composed of things like races with tags in them,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
other kinds of tags so this was the directive, but this isn't too hard to do.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So, if we do something like that, I think I'm going to call that is,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
use green to represent protocol credit code.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I'm using sort of fuzzy terms of LAN devising here, I'm not trying to use any kind of standard terms.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So now what's going to happen is, hopefully we'll get pretty good coverage of the protocol code still.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
To get quite good coverage of lexical HTML processing and we're going to fall off the cliff again.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Because as soon as we get to the render, it's going to become apparent,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and we didn't try hard enough to generate valid HTML

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and we're going to get something to render very often.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So now, what we've accomplished here while we pushed the coverage that we're getting

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
on the software under test farther into the system, it is farther into the HTML processing chain,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
but still haven't pushed it very far.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, the next thing that we can do is use some sort of a grammar

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
or some sort of a structural definition of HTML to generate random but valid HTML.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The next thing is valid HTML.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And so what's going to happen is, a coverage of the protocol code and the lexer may decrease,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
while on the other hand, we're going to be able to push

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
into the HTML processing code quite deeply before falling off a cliff.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So what've we done? We've traded off coverage in the early parts of the web browser

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which may well be so simple that we don't care about much about them for coverage farther in.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And so finally, what we could do is, generate random code that includes

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
elements of scripting, forms, whatever else that we're interested in testing

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and we can run that through and now we can start randomly testing our browser with this.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
What's going to happen now is, our coverage might decrease

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
even a little bit more in the early parts because we're spending more time doing other things,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
but we're probably not going to fall off a cliff at all.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And so, you can see that in most cases when we do random testing,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
what we're looking for is something like this kind of flat line,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and what this flat line indicates is that we're covering

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
all parts of the software under test roughly equally.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
What we're going to see is as we look through more random testing examples,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is getting sort of a coverage curve like this often requires quite a lot of work, quite a lot of sensitivity

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to the structure of the input demand, but on the other hand,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
we get paid back for that work with random tests that can exercise the entire software under test

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and that's going to be a valuable thing in many cases.
