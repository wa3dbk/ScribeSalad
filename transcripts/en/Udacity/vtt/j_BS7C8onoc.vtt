00:00:07.638 --> 00:00:10.410
the left is an example of the shadow buffer's stored depths with black being

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.130
closer to the light. On the right, this shadow map is used to detect from the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.409
camera's view which pixels are in shadow and which are in light.
