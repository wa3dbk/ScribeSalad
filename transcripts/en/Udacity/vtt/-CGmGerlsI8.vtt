00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.564
You may have noticed that the symmetric, so what happens on the left is

00:00:03.564 --> 00:00:08.432
reversed on the right. In the first region, we see the graph starts off at the

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:12.275
horizontal asymptote y equals 0, and rises to the vertical asymptote of x

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:18.238
equals 3. We can also say it is increasing at the y-value of each point, as we

00:00:18.238 --> 00:00:23.567
move right, is greater than the y-value of the point before. In the last

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:28.128
region, it's the opposite. It starts at the vertical asymptote and falls to the

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:32.822
horizontal one, this means it's decreasing. At x equals 3, we have an

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:37.681
asymptote. And the curve to the right of that rises from negative infinity up

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:41.965
to the maximum that you found in the question before at 3.5 comma negative 4,

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:46.589
before falling again towards negative infinity as it approaches the asymptote x

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.123
equals 4.
