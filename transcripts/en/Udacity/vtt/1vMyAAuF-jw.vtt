00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is no, that it is actually impossible to construct one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This function must be deterministic, so it produces the same output for the same input.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We want it to produce uniform distribution

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so that means it needs to add randomness

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to what comes in, but that's impossible.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Since it's deterministic, the only randomness it could use is what's provided by x.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So there's no way to amplify that to provide more randomness in the output.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, this is actually impossible.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're going to assume they exist anyway.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And the assumption is that, even though it's impossible

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in theory to do this, in practice we can build hash functions

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that provide mappings that are computationally

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
very difficult and indistinguishable from uniform

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
by an adversary with a reasonable amount

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of computational resources.
