00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.694
We begin this lesson by talking about Henry Molaison. One thing we didn't

00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:07.785
discuss about HM was the task they had him engage in. In this task,

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:12.010
neuropsychologist, Brenda Milner, who was working with HM, had him perform a

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.309
mirror tracing task like this one. HM was to track within two lines of the

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:23.231
star, while viewing it only through a mirror. Which was the reverse image. So,

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:27.061
if his hand moved one way, the hand in the mirror moved the other. They asked

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:32.719
HN to perform this task up to ten times each day for three days. They counted

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.683
the errors each time he went outside of the lines. What's interesting is that

00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:40.587
HM's drawings improved even though he couldn't recall having done this task

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:44.445
before. Now you're looking at the times that I tried it, and I'll be honest,

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:48.675
this task was really hard to do. So what does this tell us about the brain? HM

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:54.874
didn't remember engaging in this task, but he visibly improved. Well, it turns

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:58.579
out that he couldn't form new explicit long-term memories due to damage to his

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.099
hippocampus and surrounding areas, but he could learn new skills. As was

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.310
demonstrated by his performance on this task.
