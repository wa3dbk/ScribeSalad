The answer is a large bacteria. Matt's going to tell you why.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.420
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Believe it or not, an Amoeba has more than 66 times more DNA than humans do.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.128
While and Amoeba has 200 billion letters, humans only have 3 billion. So as you

00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:21.750
can see, it's not the amount of DNA that makes a species complex. Otherwise,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.158
the Amoeba would be the most complex organism of all. Instead, it matters what

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:30.903
the sequence of those letters in your DNA are, because they code very specific

00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:38.029
instructions. Next, we'll see how that code can be turned into flesh and blood.
