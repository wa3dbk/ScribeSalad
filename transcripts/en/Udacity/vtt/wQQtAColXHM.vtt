00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.593
The answer is that base 6, and
base 16 would've worked as well.

00:00:04.593 --> 00:00:09.368
The key is to avoid carrying, so that
the effects of including a number on one

00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.990
column, never spill over into another.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.115
2 and 3 won't work.

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:15.595
6 and 16 on the other hand do work,

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:19.960
since there is a total of
at most five in any column.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.074
Actually, base four and

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:24.890
base five work as well, thought the
argument is a little more complicated.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.790
I'll leave it to you to
work out as an exercise.
