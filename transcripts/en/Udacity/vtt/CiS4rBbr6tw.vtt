00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.910
We've done two things up to this point. We

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.740
created a variable called year_joined, based on the tenure variable,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.990
and we converted year_joined, to the variable year_joined_bucket. A categorical

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.970
variable. That bin their users into different groups. Let's table

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.320
this new variable to see the distribution in each group.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.340
Here we can see that we have our four bins

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.260
of users, depending on when they joined Facebook, and it

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.550
looks like two people have a value of NA. Let's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.920
use this new year joined bucket variable to create a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.370
line graph Like we did for gender at the start of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.790
the lesson. As a reminder, here's the code that generated this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.610
plot earlier. Also, notice how we compute the median friend count

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.080
for each age using the fun.y parameter, and the summary for

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.550
the stat parameter. Using a similar code structure that we see

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.260
here. I want you to create a plot for friend count

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.590
versus age, so that each year join bucket has its own

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.170
line on the graph. In other words, each

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.480
bucket will be a color line that tracks the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.330
median friend count across the age of users,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.250
just as it did in this plot for genders.
