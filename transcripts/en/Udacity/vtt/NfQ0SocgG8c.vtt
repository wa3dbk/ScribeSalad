00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's think about it for a little bit, you'll see there is really only two possibilities.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If we're trying to find the shortest path from I to J that is allowed to use K

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and any of the nodes with numbers smaller than K.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There are two possibilities. It may be that we don't need to use K at all for the smallest path.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We just follow path from I to J only using nodes who have values less than K

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or we go and visit K and then we go from K to J,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but in visiting K, we don't ever need to visit K on the way to K that wouldn't be a very good path.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The shortest path from I to K only using nodes that are less than K

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
then we follow another path now from K to J only using nodes whose numbers are less than K.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Those are the only things that could happen. We don't want to visit K twice.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We're not allowed to use any nodes that are greater than K

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
those are the two possibilities and whichever one of these two things is shortest.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The shortest path from I to K followed by the shortest path from K to J

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or the shortest path from I to J whichever those two things are shortest,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is the shortest path from I to J possibly using K and things less than K.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We can just write that in a straightforward way

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
by taking advantage of the fact that someone has given us the K,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
not tooth decay but matrix decay.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The length of the shortest path from I to K using only those less than K, we have that already.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Someone gave it to us very helpfully.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
All we need to do is compare the distance of I to J not using K

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and the distance from I to K not using K and K to J not using K.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's weird, but it's the right thing to do.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We can take advantage of this insight to actually create an efficient algorithm

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We can initialize D⁰ so this is the length of the shortest path from I to J

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
using nodes only numbered less than zero which is to say no intermediate node,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but that's just the direct cost of going from I to J.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
&gt;From the cost in our graph, we can fill in this matrix.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And once we have D⁰ initialize, we can run K from 0 to n-1

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and for each pair of I and J, take Dk+1 to be the smaller of D⁰[k,i,,j]

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and D⁰[k,i,k} and D⁰[k,i,j] add it together just as I was describing before.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
When this is all over, when this loop is done, we have the D⁰n,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but D⁰[n,i,j} is the length of the shortest from I to J

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
only hopping on nodes that are numbered less than n, but that's all the nodes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
All the nodes are numbered less than n.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
They are all numbered from 0 to n-1.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so this is the length of the shortest path from I to J, unrestricted, full stop.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
so that's pretty cool, and if you think about what's going on here,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
this initialization step runs over all pairs of nodes so that's n².

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This loop runs over all pairs of nodes n², but it does this from each value from 0 to n-1.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So altogether we're talking about n*n² or n³.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
This better than the n3/logn we get by applying repeat Dijkstra to a dense graph.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So for a dense graph, you're better off using Floyd-Warshall n³ instead of the n³/logn.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Log n is often not that huge a number so your mileage may vary.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
so you can actually try the overhead, but boy it's hard to imagine having less overhead than this

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It is very straightforward it runs through the n³ possibilities,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and in fact, if we do this carefully, we don't need to keep a separate D matrix for each of this cases.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You can actually do these updates completely in place so the storage is pretty low too.
