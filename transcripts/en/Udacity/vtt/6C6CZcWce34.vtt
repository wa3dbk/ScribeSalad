00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.440
In Phase 1 we divided our system up into components responsible for

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.230
handling events and providing percepts. We also saw how guarantees were

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.010
specified by invariants. Note that although the example invariants we saw was,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.360
were attached to associations, other invariants, invariants might be directly

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.942
provided by the components themselves. For Phase 2, we want to determine

00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:27.480
the systems architecture. What this means is determining how the components will

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.369
interact. This determination takes the form of selecting an architectural style.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.920
An architectural style is a generic pattern of interactions that can be used to

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.300
to address non-functional concerns such as performance, reuse, or reliability.
