00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Precedence and associativity were not so tough,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which is convenient because they're also super easy in Python.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For our parser, in Python, we can just write out a table:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a single variable, called Precedence,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that lists lower precedence operators at the top

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and higher precedence operators at the bottom.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I know what you're thinking: this is totally reversed--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and you're exactly right, but it's not the first thing we've grown

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
upside down in computer science programming languages.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So lower precedence operators that bind very weakly--up here at the top;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
higher precedence operators that you have to do first--down here at the bottom.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we can also indicate their associativity at the same time.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So we're going to have our precedence and associativity.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This says that Times and Divide are both left-associative

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and they're very high precedence.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Plus and Minus are both left-associative and they're lower precedence.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And then our parser will automatically

00:00:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
get rid of the ambiguity for us by using these rules.
