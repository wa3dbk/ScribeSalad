00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.010
So we have been talking about
implementation of access control and

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.560
the resources and request for
those resources and

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.740
we said well in Linux based systems,
resources look like files.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.850
So let's actually see how the resources
are used and you know what

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.330
kind of calls we make for accessing them
and what happens during those calls.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.840
So, first of all, of course,
resource has to be created.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.250
So the process that creates
this resource is the owner.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.810
That owner can have whatever set of
access rights they want to have.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.116
In a Unix-like system, you probably
know the number of ways in which you can

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.150
create a file, for example.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.230
So once a file exists and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.955
we want to access it,
you do what is called open the file.

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:42.690
S this is sort of like
prepping the file.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.220
If it doesn't exist,
then file gets created.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.020
When you do that,
file has a name and mode here says,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
do you want to read this file or
do you want to write it or execute it.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.200
What are you opening it for?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.722
How do you want to access it?

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.350
Once that file exists,
the first thing we do is open it.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.330
When you open it the operating system
returns to you a descriptor which is

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.360
a small number, and we'll see what
the use of that is, but as a result

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.240
we'll see that to be able to access or
get the data that's in the file,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.110
write it into the file, we're
going to need the file's descriptor.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.870
So the descriptor comes when you
open the file, you prep it or

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.260
get it ready for access.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.610
So a system call you make saying,
this is the file I want to access,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.940
this is how I access it.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.100
The operating system
prepares the file for

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.470
accessing, returns you this file
descriptor that you then hold on to.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.190
So if you want to read this
file in the read call,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.110
this is another system
call that you have.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.640
You have to go to the system.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420
You specify what file
using a descriptor.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.230
This is what was returned here.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.890
It's a small number.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.070
So this could be file for example.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.360
If you're reading you are to specify
where the read data should be put,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.950
how much data you are reading.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.590
That's the buffer, and the size.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.210
Data is going to come from the file.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.990
Where is this data?

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, the file we know, unless file
point or that points at the next

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.040
place from where your data is going to
come and it is advance that you read.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.979
So whatever data follows the file,
current file pointer,

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.120
we are going to pull that data,
lays that in the buffer and

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240
that's what the recall is going to do.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.620
Similarly there's a write call, except
that the data flows in the opposite

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.820
direction, so the data is here then
it's going to go into the file.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.710
And how much data,
that's what we specify in this call.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.110
So an open is followed by one or
more read or writes.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.710
And when you're done you close the file.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.550
And once you close the file,
again the input

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.800
here is the descriptor that says
what file that you had open before.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.160
Then this file we are basically telling
the system is that we're not going to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.220
need to access it anymore.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.680
So the system can,
if I'd set up some data structures,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.560
it can essentially free
those up at that point.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.020
A resource is a file.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.880
Users have UID, we also talked about
group ID, and to access a resource,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.940
this is what we basically have to go
through, file exists, they'll open it,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.100
then then they have to say read or
write it, and then you close it.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.260
If you forget to close it and
the process terminates,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.580
it's implicitly closed, but
this is how a file gets used.
