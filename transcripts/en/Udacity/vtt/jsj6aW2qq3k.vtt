00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There's something really surprising about these age distributions, which is these ones are clustered

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
very close to 18 whereas these are all over the place really far from 18 in most cases.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So can we calculate this somehow?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I would say the mode, the median, or the mean don't really capture the spread of the data.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What does calculate the spread is called the variance.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now we will compute the variance of the data, and the very first trick you apply is,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we normalized these sequences by subtracting the mean from each data item.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So in the case of the friends, if we subtract 18 from 17 we get -1, 1, 0, -1, 1.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If we subtract 18 from these data sequence, we get -11, 20, -14, 5, and 0.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If you compute the mean of these two sequences, then you find the mean in both cases is 0

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and that's bigger the work and the reason is by subtracting the mean from every single data item

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we took it out of the equation and we arrived at 0.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But what's now really interesting is, that these numbers are much

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
closer to zero than these numbers over here.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So, the spread over here is much larger.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now you might think in computing the variance,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you just add up all these values and measure up the spread, but the truth is it doesn't work.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If you add them up, they are actually 0. So we have to add up something else.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What's commonly added up are the squares of those values. The squares here are 1, 1, 0, 1, 1.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Whereas over here, they're 121, 400, 196, 25, 0.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
For the variance, we sum the squares of all these numbers and normalize that.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But the squares are not taken of the original data but taken off the original data minus the mean

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and we're going to write that as Greek letter over here, µ.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Do me a favor and try to compute the variance for the first sequence,

00:02:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which you obtained by adding those squares over here and dividing them by 5.
