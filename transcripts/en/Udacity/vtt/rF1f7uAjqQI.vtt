00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.656
The task at hand was simply to remove the last element off the list and insert

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:11.135
it as the first one. Let's look at the code, the index of the last element is

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:17.057
the size minus one. That's the one that we remove. Now as it happens the remove

00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:22.308
method returns the element that it was removed. Now you might say that's not

00:00:22.308 --> 00:00:26.702
fair, how was I suppose to know that? So let's say that you didn't. In that

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:30.289
case, you could have done it in two steps. You could first get the element and

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.475
then remove it. Either way will work. Let me get back to my original way

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:39.407
because it's a bit shorter. Now that we've removed the last element we simply

00:00:39.407 --> 00:00:44.655
stick it at the very beginning, like this. And there you have it, what was

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:49.654
previously the last element is now the initial one. Sara has a couple more

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:54.140
exercise prepared for you where you practice working with set, add and remove.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.319
Have fun.
