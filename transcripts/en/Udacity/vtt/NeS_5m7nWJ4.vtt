00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.258
In the new space for the getFriends method I want to start by creating a string

00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:07.592
that I can use to collect all of the names. Now I'll want to add all of the

00:00:07.592 --> 00:00:11.380
friends. So I'll loop through all of the friends, one at a time, and I'll add

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.530
the separator and the ith friend's name onto that variable I was using as the

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.948
collector. But as this is right now it's going to print out a separator before

00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:25.330
the fist name. So I need to look for a special case. In the regular case, where

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.740
we're not looking at the very first friend, we'll add the separator and the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.051
friend's name. But if we are looking at the very first friend, then we just add

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:37.176
the friend's name. I'll just fix a couple syntax errors, and I'll remember to

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:40.653
return that variable that I used to collect all the names and now when I run

00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:44.244
the tester, I can see that it works with whatever kind of separators I put in,

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:50.389
whether it's a semicolon, a vertical bar, or a unicode heart.
