00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.176
To get to this answer of 1/10 faster, I
actually didn't need to wait to simplify.

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:08.368
I could have done it sooner. Let's see
what that looks like. I can reduce any

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.494
common factors that appear in the
numerators and in the denominators. I know

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:15.477
if I multiply these fractions, I would do
21 and 54.

00:00:15.477 --> 00:00:20.015
I'm going to break up my four into factors
of two. I know 2/2 makes one. So, whenever

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:25.215
I see a 2/2, I can simplify that, then I
would just multiply as usual. 1*1 is one

00:00:25.227 --> 00:00:29.815
and 512 is ten, so I still get 1/10. You
might have heard of the term

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:34.865
crosscanceling before, that could also
work. I know that two goes in a two and

00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:39.115
two goes in a four. If I would write a
factor in the numerator and at the

00:00:39.127 --> 00:00:44.221
denominator, I can cancel. 2/2 makes one,
and 4/2 makes two. When I multiply across,

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:48.085
I'm going to have 11 and 52.
Either way, I still wind up with 1/10. The

00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:52.744
key thing is you want to make sure you're
only cancelling that factor that appears

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:57.252
in the numerator and in the denominator,
because we know anything over itself is

00:00:57.264 --> 00:00:57.340
one.
