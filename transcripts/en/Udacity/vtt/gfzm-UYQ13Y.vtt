00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.227
So here are all the y values for these corresponding x values. And we can see

00:00:04.227 --> 00:00:08.003
that each of these pairs of numbers, where one is just the negative version of

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.838
the previous one, all have matching y values, despite their opposite signs in

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:18.441
x. Let's think about why this is. Well, one way we can rewrite y equals x to

00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:24.347
the 4th is y equals x squared squared. We can do the same thing for something

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:28.278
like y equals x to the 6th. That can be written as y equals x to the 3rd

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.232
squared. And we know that whenever we're squaring something it's going to

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:37.309
involve multiplying that thing by itself. So if what's inside here, like x to

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.364
the 3rd. In the case of y plus x to the 6th. Is negative, squaring it is going

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:46.712
to make it positive. That means that any sine g/ differences in x. Are going to

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:50.947
be cancelled out in y. So that helps tell us why, even when we move way over to

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:55.132
the left. Way to the negative side of the graph. On the x axis. The general

00:00:55.132 --> 00:00:59.370
behavior of the graph of a polynomial with an even degree. Is going to match

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.970
the behavior on the right side, because of that squaring action here. Now, if

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.010
we had a more complex polynomial here instead of just y equals x to the 4th.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.690
The y values to these numbers might not line up exactly. They might not be

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.366
exactly equal, because of the terms following this. But by the time we move way

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:18.724
far out in x. Either positively or negatively. This overall pattern would

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:22.709
re-emerge and we'll see the same general behavior on either side of the graph.
