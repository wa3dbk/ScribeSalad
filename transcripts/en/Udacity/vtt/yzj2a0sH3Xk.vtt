00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
The correct answer here is 3 to the power of N/2

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.600
because if you look at this tree, it starts out here at this level, at the first level,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.760
and it has 0 assignments that it's considering.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.910
At level 1 it's considering 3 possible assignments, so it triples at each time.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.380
At level 2 it's considering 9.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.060
At level 3 it will be considering 27 and so on and so on and so on.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.590
For level X it's considering 3 to the power of X different possibilities.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.960
The maximum level is N/2, so it's 3 to the power of N/2.

00:00:33.960 --> 99:59:59.000
So the correct solution here is 3 to the power of N/2.
