00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.658
You may have figured out that the Significance level is the p-value. You see

00:00:04.658 --> 00:00:11.415
that the p-value is less than 0.05 but greater than 0.01. Therefore, at the

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:17.767
0.05 level, we would reject H not. But at the 0.01 level, we wouldn't. You

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:22.252
could have also used the T-table, and found the t-critical values for an alpha

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:27.575
level of 0.05 and 0.01. And you would see that the F-statistic falls in between

00:00:27.575 --> 00:00:32.049
them. That's another way to decide what our conclusion will be.
