00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.475
Remember, we're trying to find a confidence interval for the true difference

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:08.715
between the pairs of shoes owned by males and females. Since we're concerned

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:12.290
with the difference, we wouldn't use one of our two samples means for our point

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.902
estimate. We would use the difference between them. And it doesn't matter which

00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:21.585
direction we go. We can either use the positive or negative t critical value as

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:29.367
well. 0.96 is our t statistic. We don't want that. We want the cutoff for the

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:35.772
middle 95%. And finally, for our standard error, we calculated that to be

00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:39.270
15.72. And the standard error is never negative.
