00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.670
Well, let's have a look at how to do this. Again, we're giving an arbitrary

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.955
point on the flag. Let's remember that x moves this way, y moves this way. So,

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:14.590
in this case the y value doesn't matter at all. What matters is where x is. The

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.860
total width here is given to us, so this cutoff here is width over 3 and this

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.912
one is width times 2 over 3. So, the first condition here is going to be x less

00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:31.667
than width over 3 or maybe less than equal width over 3. Let's settle that. So,

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:35.876
let's assume that the width was 300, then x could be any value between 0 and

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:44.056
299. The first 100 values, from 0 to 99 should be blue. The values from 100 to

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:51.510
199 should be white. And the values from 200 to 299 should be red. So, the last

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.848
value that stays in this branch here should be x equals 99. With the 300, width

00:00:58.848 --> 00:01:03.176
over 3 is 100. So the less than is correct. We want to be less than 100 to stay

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:07.780
here. As soon as we're between 100 and less than 2 3rds of the width, we want

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.005
to be in the middle brand, branch. And, finally, if neither of those is true,

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:18.570
then we want to be here. And thats the code. The takeaway is, if you need to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.726
make multiple decisions, then you use the if, else if, else clause. Sarah has

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:28.054
prepared a bunch of practice problems for you, so that you get more exercises

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.760
that involve making these kinds of decisions. Have fun.
