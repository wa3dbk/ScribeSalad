00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.498
A great way to build an audience
is through social networks.

00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:07.226
Lots of games have options to link to
Facebook or Twitter and share your high

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:10.787
score with your friends or even invite
them to play the same game as you.

00:00:10.787 --> 00:00:14.429
And they'll give you an incentive to
do so, like Candy Crush will give you

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.210
powerups if you can invite a new
Facebook friend to play the game.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.690
It's like a trade.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.620
Some games even rely on an individual
fan to spread the word, people

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.250
like YouTube stars or Tumblr users whose
reviews can reach a lot of people.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.210
So as you build your game,
think about how you'll want to integrate

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.140
with social media and
create your own gaming community.
