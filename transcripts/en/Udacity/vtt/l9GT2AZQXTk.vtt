00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.690
We've talked about widgets and

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.520
user wallpapers, but
perhaps we're thinking too small.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.950
We're still limited to
just a single device.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.343
However, Android gives us the tools to
build a truly multi-device experience

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:14.655
through AndroidWear,
Android TV and more.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:18.485
AndroidWear gives us ability to
really improve our notifications.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.900
High-resolution backgrounds,
more information,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.200
and even the ability to add
custom actions and layouts,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.810
to give users a great experience
without pulling our their phone.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.540
Taking it even farther, you can build
Android apps that run directly on

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.750
the watch, letting users
bring up your app on command,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.150
say, right before deciding on
whether to pack that umbrella.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.810
Or build a watch face to make
the weather information available

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.230
all the time.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.850
Android TV opens up the other end of
the spectrum with a 10-foot experience.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.805
This is where that great imagery and

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:52.660
easy-to-read information
can really be useful.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.380
That's not counting the great video or
radar imagery opportunities that could

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.380
really make the big screen
experience amazing.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.170
If you'd like to learn more
about all the ways to take your

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.190
app even farther and explore the myriad
of devices available to you, check

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.490
out the ubiquitous computing course
which goes into these topics and more.
