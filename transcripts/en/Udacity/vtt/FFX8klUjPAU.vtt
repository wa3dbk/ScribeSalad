00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.270
So if we talk about quantifications,
is there a formula for risk or

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.520
the risk exposure we have?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.450
Risk is really, we said, how likely,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.730
the probability of an adverse
security event happening.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.230
So the first thing you have to say,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.520
well there is a threat out there,
they may come after me.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
I have some controls in place, but
they may be able to get around them.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.890
And actually, I might get compromised,
may experience a breach or

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.440
whatever it is.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.100
So what is the likelihood of that?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.254
So you have to have the probability,

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:33.876
then you have to multiple by
the impact of that adverse event.

00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:37.400
It's going to cost me $10
million to deal with that.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.540
Well, the probability is half.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.260
That's way too much.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.510
But if it is half and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.910
it's going to cost you $10 million,
your risk is $5 million.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.584
We said quantifying, of course we had
to quantify both of these quantities.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:54.595
The probability, as well as the impact
or the loss that you're going to suffer

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:58.300
as a result of the adverse
event that we're talking about.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.887
So there's something
called risk leverage,

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:03.418
because we like to reduce
our risk exposure.

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:07.950
And one way we can do that is by having
some sort of a control in place.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.020
A control we know comes with a cost.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.760
So risk leverage is for a given control.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.030
Talking about quantifying it and
then sort of, if it's too high,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.710
you don't like it, we can try to reduce
it by putting in one or more controls.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.834
So when you put a control you can ask
what the risk level of that control is.

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:30.116
So, the way to sort of compute that
is that you say, what was my risk

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:34.900
exposure before or without the control
that is under consideration?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.542
That's without deploying that.

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:41.120
Minus the risk exposure after
this control is deployed.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.660
This difference really is nothing but
the amount by which the risk is reduced

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.380
because of this control that we're
going to put into our enterprise.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.980
So, that's the decrees in risk
divided by the cost of that control

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.040
that we're talking about.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.150
We've been saying,
we have to have cost benefit analysis.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.610
This is how much risk.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.170
This is what happens to risk
if we do something about

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.490
unacceptable level of risk.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.479
So this is the cost of that control,
that we have in the denominator here.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.410
So, if you divide the reduction
in risk by the cost,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.230
that gives you the risk leverage.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.460
For any control that you have,
risk leverage should be greater than 1.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.460
It makes no sense for it to be less than
1 because, in that case you're saying,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.020
your risk reduction actually
is smaller than the cost.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.580
It's not very smart that
you pay more and, overall,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.330
you're not in a better place than you
were before in terms of the cost and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.700
whatever risk that you have.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.160
So, this is how we compute the leverage,
and whenever you talk about

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.580
a particular control, if you do this and
the value is not greater than 1,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.250
then of course that control
should not be considered.
