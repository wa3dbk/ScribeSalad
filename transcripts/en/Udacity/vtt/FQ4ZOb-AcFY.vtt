00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.819
We saw at the end of the last lesson that we could come up with a function for

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.717
the area of a rectangle by saying that A of l,w equals lw. The product of the

00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:14.604
length and width of any rectangle. Well, in our case, l and w are going to be

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:20.285
represented by a different variable, actually. They're both written already in

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:25.646
terms of x. I'm going to call this the length and this width. So in our case the

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:30.947
length is actually just x plus x, or 2x plus 3. Remember that the m here stands

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:36.424
for meters, not a variable. And the width is just 2x. If we want to apply this

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:41.635
out we get 4x squared plus 6x squared meters. So instead of writing the area as

00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:45.928
a function of length and width, instead we're writing it as a function of x now.

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:50.216
It's function that only involves only one variable since we had both of these

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:53.408
original variables in terms of the same third variable.
