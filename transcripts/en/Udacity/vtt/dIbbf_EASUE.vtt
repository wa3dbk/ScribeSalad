00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.782
Pretty much everybody has to pay taxes and Grant, with his new Gleaming Glasses

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:08.497
company is no exception. The way that taxes depend on income can be described

00:00:08.497 --> 00:00:12.283
by functions. But these are slightly different functions than ones we've seen

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:16.430
before. Let's check them out. First things first, here's a chart showing how a

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.907
person's yearly income, determines the amount of money they will pay the

00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:24.942
government in taxes where Grant lives. We can see that the tax rate over here,

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:28.270
or the percent of their income that a person will pay the government in taxes,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.340
changes depending on how high the person's income is. The way this works is a

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.682
little bit complicated, so bear with me here. Now someone makes under $5000,

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:42.037
please note this entire column is in dollars, so if someone makes under $5000,

00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:46.824
their tax rate is 0%. So, they actually don't have to pay the government

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:51.442
anything at all. If someone's total income is between $5,000 and $15,000, the

00:00:51.442 --> 00:00:58.084
first $5,000 of their income is set aside and not taxed. Then what is left over

00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:03.088
is taxed at this 10% rate. If someone earns between $15,000 and $35,000 total,

00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:06.808
then, as with the person in this lower bracket, the first $5,000 of their

00:01:06.808 --> 00:01:13.044
income isn't taxed. The next 10,000, is taxed at 10%, and then the rest is

00:01:13.044 --> 00:01:18.700
taxed at 20%. If the person makes even more money than this total, then the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.150
amount above $35,000, is taxed at 30%. We can think of this tax rate scaling as

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.992
a sort of layering effect. As were counting up the money a person makes, we

00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:32.430
don't start by thinking about the total. We start by counting from zero. Once

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.902
we get to 5,000, then we start to add our tax rate, and we keep counting up and

00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:39.289
up, increasing the rate when we need to.
