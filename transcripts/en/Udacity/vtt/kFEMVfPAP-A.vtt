00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this problem, we have to determine that if we have some code that does some stuff,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and we have a list, and we compute some solution,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that if I insert this call to the function "proc" 1, 2, 3, or 4 as we'll go through them

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that this code behaves exactly the same no matter what else it does. So let's get to it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In this first procedure, there's only one line.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We set the first value of p to equal its second value.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is going to change the elements in p.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I mean, if we had in a list [1, 2] executing proc1 would then change it to [1, 2].

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Obviously, that can very well effect how this could execute, so this isn't right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This one can be a little tricky, so let's work through it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We know that p is a pointer to a list--let's say it's 1, 2, and 3.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now we're reassigning what p points to to the original value of p, which is this,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
concatenated with the list 1.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is going to create a new list, because that's what the plus operator does with lists.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We want to create a new list.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now p points to this. We don't do anything with p.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But most importantly the original list has been left unchanged.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The end result is that this is good.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We can go through this problem like we did the previous one.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We start with a variable p that points to a list.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We then create a new variable "q," which points to the same thing as p.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
On p we append 3, and then on q, which is the same list, we pop 3.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The end result is the same list we had before.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Here we create a new list called "q," which is an empty list. There's nothing there.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
While p is not empty, we append onto q what we pop from p.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If we remember, the pop is going to take the last entry in p and return it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's going to pop off 32, and then we're going to append that on the q.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This is going to continue until we have the reverse of the previous list here and p is empty,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
which I'll just symbolize with that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Then we're going to reverse the process here.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
If I undo what I just did, the end result is we have the original list, and we have the empty list.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Although, this doesn't matter.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The main point is that we still have our original list.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This one is good.
