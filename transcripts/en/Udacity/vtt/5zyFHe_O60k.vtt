00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.208
Hello, and welcome to this new lesson. Today we're going to be taking about

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:07.134
Array Lists. An Array List collects objects and all the objects in the Array

00:00:07.134 --> 00:00:11.840
List need to be of the same type. Now what would we like to collect? Me,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.360
personally I'd like to collect valuable paintings. So let's see how we would do

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.297
that in Java. Here you see the rather long declaration of an Array List that

00:00:21.297 --> 00:00:26.821
can collect pictures. Let's work through the pieces. We're declaring a

00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:31.294
variable, called gallery, its type is an ArrayList, but whenever we have an

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:37.814
ArrayList we need to also specify the type of the objects that it collects.

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:42.170
That's the pictures here, so the whole thing here, ArrayList of picture, is the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.610
type of the gallery object. To the right you simply have a constructor call,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.707
where you again have to type ArrayList of picture. We have the new operator,

00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:55.243
because we make a new object off the ArrayList type and the parenthesis here

00:00:55.243 --> 00:01:01.892
simply mean that we pass nothing to the constructor. What we get is an empty

00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:08.250
ArrayList, which can, as we add them in, hold as many pictures as we like.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.621
Here, we add a couple of pictures to the gallery. The add method, takes as its

00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:18.466
argument, the object that we want to add. Once you've added objects to an Array

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:22.973
List, you'll want to be able to do something with the contents. Let's look at

00:01:22.973 --> 00:01:23.680
that next
