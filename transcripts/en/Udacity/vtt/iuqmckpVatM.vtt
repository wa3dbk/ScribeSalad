Okay, enough about analyze. Let's talk about parallelize.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.323
We're going to use a running example to illustrate the concepts that we'll go through

00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:09.765
over the rest of this unit. And that example is matrix transpose.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:11.879
It's a very simple algorithm that still has enough meat in it

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.128
to illustrate a lot of the points we want to bring up.

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:19.725
Matrix transpose just takes some matrix and exchanges the rows and columns.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:24.661
So a particular element in this row, for example, would have coordinate a,b.

00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:26.500
So its i coordinate is a, its j coordinate is b,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.989
and its new i coordinate in the transpose matrix will be b,

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.685
and its new j coordinate will be a. Pretty simple.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.647
To make our code even simpler, we're actually going to restrict ourselves to square matrices.

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.973
You'll remember that this came up all the way back in Unit 2

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.520
as a really common parallel communication pattern.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.449
So transposing a matrix or doing some equivalent operation on an array

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.045
or an image or a structure of arrays, this comes up literally all the time.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:52.329
So even though it's a simple example, as you'll see,

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.309
there's a lot of opportunity to optimize it and it's a really important one.
