Listing out the prime factorizations, we can see that our greatest common factor

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:09.801
is 8ab squared. So this is what I list on the outside of a parenthesis to start

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:14.341
the factor. We're left with 5ab for the first term. If I factor 8 times ab

00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.818
squared out of the first term, I'm left with 5 times ab. That goes here.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:23.632
Negative 2b squared would be remaining from the second term. And negative 3

00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:28.039
would be remaining for this last term. Essentially, we're just dividing this

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.442
term by 8ab squared. We know ab squared divided by ab squared would equal one,

00:00:32.442 --> 00:00:36.674
so we're just left with negative 24 divided by 8, which is negative 3. As

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:41.076
always, you can check your result by multiplying or distributing this 8ab

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:47.075
squared to each of the terms. You should wind up with your original expression.
