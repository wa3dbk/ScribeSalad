All lights have a color. The ambient light doesn't have an intensity as this is

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.080
a special light meant to fill in areas of shadow and should not be cranked up.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.804

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:14.209
a direction. Ambient and point or positional lights do not.
