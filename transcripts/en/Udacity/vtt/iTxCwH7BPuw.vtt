00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.826
Alright. Now this is pretty straightforward. Seeing as though the calling code

00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:05.304
has given us an X and Y value of where to exist in the world, we simply pass

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:09.568
those through to the entity definition object. Next, we actually determine the

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:13.388
half width and the half height of the bounding box for this object. Now for the

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:16.160
simple projectile class that we're using here, we statically define its width

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.462
and height to five units. Of course, passing half of that to the right

00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:23.170
variable. In addition, we also set the surface parameter of dampening to zero.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.580
Now in order to facilitate as a debugging aid for our purposes, we pass in an

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.110
ID object to the entity definition. Now inside the addBody method, we attach

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.410
this ID properly so that later on we can identify this object differential from

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.234
everything else. This helps with debugging and determining whether it's a

00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:40.839
missile hitting you in the forehead, or a rubber chicken.
