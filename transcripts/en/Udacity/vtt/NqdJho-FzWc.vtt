00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Some of you have been asking about syntax I've used in Python

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
basically with these asterisks in function definitions and in function calls.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'll just show you some Python syntax that I've been using that is pretty helpful.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
One of the things we can do when we have a function definition--we'll call this function foo--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it can take a variable number of arguments. This is a handy thing you can do in Python.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The way you do this is you say " * ", and then you give it a variable name.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Generally you say " * a".

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This basically says take all of the arguments passed into this function,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
all the unnamed arguments--we'll come back to the named arguments in a second--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and store them in a tuple, and we'll call it "a."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That means in this function foo we have a variable a,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and if I were to return a and call foo, it would look something like this.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If I called foo with no arguments, it would return just an empty tuple.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If I were to call foo with the arguments (1, 2, 3), it would return a tuple of (1, 2, 3).

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If I were to change this to return a [0], and I were to call foo with (1, 2, 3) again,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It would just return the number 1.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This is a handy way of making a function that can take any number of arguments.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now, I used this in class in unit 3 when we were pulling a link out of the database--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
When we were pulling a link out of that SQL lite database in the IDE.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
What you get when you pull something out of the database is just a tuple of all the columns.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I can pass that tuple into the link constructor to make a link object.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's what I was doing there.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now, something you've seen in my code looks something like this.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I often have a function--I think in my code I have something that's like this--def render.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Oops. No paren there.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It may take *a and **kw--oops, two stars.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
In sketchpad, they edit all these mistakes out.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Generally when you see this kind of construct in Python--*a, **kw--

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that means they're writing a function that adds a little bit of behavior to another function.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So I have another function. I think it's some sort of Jinja rendering thing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Oh, I actually I think what we say is template.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We have a template name. It's probably another argument in the function.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We may say like t.render( *a, **kw ).

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Basically all this is doing is just taking the arguments from this function,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the unnamed arguments and the named arguments--

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
an named argument would be like x = 1 versus an unnamed argument would just be 1--

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and I'm passing those directly into another function.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Probably what I did here in my render function in my code is I modified this kw argument.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I added some parameters to it--that sort of thing.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Basically now I have this function render, which does exactly what t.render does,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
except I've added more parameters to kw.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now, there are two uses of stars and star-star.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
One is in the function definition, which we talked about before, and the other is in the function call.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
If you have a tuple or a dictionary, and you put them in a function call

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
with a star and a **kw, it breaks those data structures apart and passes them in as parameters,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
which is really handy.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In a function definition, it basically takes all the parameters and puts them into a tuple.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
In a function call, it takes a tuple and turns them into function parameters.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So it's a handy thing in Python.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You see it all the time. Generally a and kw are the variable names you would use.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But you can use whatever you want, and you can use them in other contexts

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
like we did with the link database.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I hope that helps.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
There is also, I believe, links on the forum to Python function calls

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that explain the syntax for you as well.
