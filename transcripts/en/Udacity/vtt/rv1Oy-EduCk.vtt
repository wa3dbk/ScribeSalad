00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.230
Two more elements I'd like to teach you.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.320
These are called span and div.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.170
Span and div are both normal elements.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.320
They can both have content.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.400
And the only difference between these two is, span is inline, and div is block.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.450
We'll play around with these in the editor a little bit,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.970
but these elements don't do anything other than just contain their content.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.110
And there's a way to attach styles to them,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.010
to adjust different behaviors of how they display.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.030
That looks something like this.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.160
So you can see I've added two attributes, or

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.140
an attribute to each of these called class.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.680
And this is a CSS class, and this is not something we're going to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.780
spend a whole lot of time on in this course, I'll provide most of the CSS.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.850
But it's a separate language for adding styles to your documents or

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.010
changing the, changing how different text looks.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.340
And we'll be using spans and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.230
divs a lot for, you know, controlling how text is laid out.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.750
But the important thing to remember is that spans are inline and divs are block.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.830
Let's play around with these in the browser a little bit real quick so

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.940
you can see what I'm talking about.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.450
Okay, so we've got our text.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.330
And my first line is wrapped in span, and it behaves as,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.830
as we would expect an inline element to behave.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.830
Now if I were to change the span to a div,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.570
it behaves more like how the paragraph tag before behaved.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.530
This div is actually this, creates a box around this piece of text and

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.440
you can see my, we actually did something interesting, I added a little period

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.940
after the div and the period appears down on the second line here.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.250
What I'd like you to do is check all the elements that are inline.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.830
Some of these elements you haven't seen before.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.929
So I would like you to try them out in your own browser and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.078
figure it out for yourself.
