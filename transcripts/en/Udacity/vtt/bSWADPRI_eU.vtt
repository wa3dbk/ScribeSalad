00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This last step is growing customers for the web/mobile channels.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now if you remember we started here on the left. We didn't earn and paid media.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We got customers, acquired them, and activated them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We've kept them trying to keep the churn to a minimum.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And now we're going to grow customers with the series of activities just like in the physical channel.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Can we up-sell, can we next-sell, can we cross-sell,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and can get referrals that will get us a viral loop.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
One of the most important metrics to think about now that we have an end-to-end funnel

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is something called lifetime value and a lifetime value LTV is not your lifetime

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but your customer's lifetime.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
How much will they spend with you and your company from the beginning to the very end.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And this is kind of an interesting idea because most startups and most founders

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are focused on how do I get them to activate here?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But for you to be a successful company and actually thinking about

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
how much you could spend on them over here, you need to understand--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
can I get them to spend more and more over time and how to keep them

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
longer and longer by reducing churn.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So one of the interesting equations for every startup is that

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
lifetime value needs to be greater than customer acquisition cost.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Seems intuitively obvious but what you want to make sure

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
is the amount of money you're collecting over here is bigger than the customer acquisition cost

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to remember the amount of money you're spending from here to here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That was the customer acquisition cost, CAC, here.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So lifetime value needs to be greater than customer acquisition cost.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And as you get more familiar with your company and start talking to investors,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the real interesting thing is what is this ratio?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
For example, in SAS software, some investors think that number should be 3&gt;1.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
In Telecom, it might be something else but the key idea is you are now not just focused

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
on the initial purchase but you're focused on the lifetime value.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If you have world's most perfect business model, investors would love to see

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
this number much bigger than this number and so what you want to look for

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is a well-balanced model that takes into account how much you need to acquire customers

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but how much ultimately you'll extract from them over the lifetime.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
What's the lifetime?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That really is up to you and your investors on how many years you calculate lifetime value.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Some use 3 years, some use 5--that's a question that you and your investors will discuss.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This acquisition cost versus lifetime value discussion really is a balancing act.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So what are some of the balancing acts?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Well, in the customer acquisition cost, if all of a sudden, you could get a viral loop going,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
well, that decreases your cost of acquisition.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
If in fact, your conversion rate between acquisition activation could be increased.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Again, it decreases your customer acquisition cost.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If you could do in physical channels, telesales or inside sales versus having a direct sales force,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Again, your CAC declines. The idea is what can you do to make this very efficient?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And therefore, also, on lifetime value, how do you reduce churn and attrition in keeping customers?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Do you have scalable pricing? Are you cross-selling and up-selling a lot?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Can you expand your product line?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And again, are you getting a viral loop and referral loop from happy and satisfied customers

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
telling others word of mouth and so this is a balancing game,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and for first time entrepreneurs who are focused here,

00:03:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
it's really important to think about customer acquisition cost and a lifetime value.
