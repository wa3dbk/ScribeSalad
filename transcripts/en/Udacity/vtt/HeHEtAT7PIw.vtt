00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:20.756
There are several means by which your performance will be evaluated for

00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:25.130
this course. First are quizzes that you will take while watching lessons on

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.270
Udacity. These quizzes are not graded. But are included to evaluate your

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.640
understanding of material as you follow along. In terms of graded evaluation,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.470
this course includes projects, assignments, class participation and

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.050
an exam. The projects and some of the assignments are team based. And

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.960
all members of the team will receive the same score on that submittal.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.400
That said, you will have an opportunity to comment on the contributions, or

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.220
lack there, of your teammates. Those comments will become part of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.690
their class participation scores. The staff of this course,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.750
will make a strong effort to express the grading criteria for each deliverable,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.590
as explicitly as possible. Moreover, it is our intent to provide you accurate,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.220
prompt and informative feedback on your work. Should you have any

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.530
questions about a grade you receive, please send an email to the head TA.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.410
Do not post a question about grades on Piazza. Any general announcements about

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.079
grading, will be made by the staff using T-Square.
