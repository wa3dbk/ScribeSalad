00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.780
Let's look at different types of aspects
and benefits of this coded aperture.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.939
One, of course,
it allows you to compute,

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.800
capture an image in depth,
just from a single image.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.860
And there is no real loss
of image resolution for

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.715
a simple modification to a lens.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.415
Again, I don't recommend doing
to a very, your favorite lens.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.305
Depth is of course coarse,
and we saw examples of that,

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:22.395
I mean, again, we are trying to
get something out of nothing.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:24.575
If you get a little bit of depth,
but not very much, and

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:27.485
again, that is because we are trying
to basically get this out of,

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:30.555
by creating focus planes
by actually changing

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:34.275
how the focus looks like differently
because of the coded aperture.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:38.120
But, you know, we get depth, of course,
we loose light and we know that, right?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.640
Because we have a smaller opening than
this one, that basically means that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.890
the light sensitivity in your lens
of the camera is going to go down,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.750
darker scenes won't work very well.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.284
But again,
we can actually do deconvolution and

00:00:49.284 --> 00:00:52.960
increase depth of field after
the fact from a single image.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.470
So, in essence, this is like a light
field camera where we actually get

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.140
defocusing and depth information by
changing in something in front of

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.520
the lens itself, the opening or
on the plane of the lens,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.700
rather than changing the sensor, because
in light field, that's what we did.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.940
Light field camera we changed the
sensors to be able to capture different

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.590
types of lights.
