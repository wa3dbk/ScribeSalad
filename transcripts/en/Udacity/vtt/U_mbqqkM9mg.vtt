So your web browser does a great job of
concealing a lot of the complexities of

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.820
HTTP, such that the user can focus
on the web surfing experience.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.050
But as developers, we need to be able to
dig deep to see what is going on with

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.960
requests and responses.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.870
Luckily there are several tools out
there that we can use to generate

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.220
HTTP requests and view responses.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.050
In this video,
I will point out two of my favorites.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.980
If you're a big fan of command
line applications, Curl is one of

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.230
the most popular command line tools for
sending and receiving HTTP messages,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.350
even though it can also transmit
on several other protocols.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.470
If you prefer a graphical
user interface, Postman is

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.250
an easy-to-navigate Chrome extension you
can use to build and view HTTP messages.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.200
Documentation for using these tools
can be found in the instructor notes.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.020
I recommend choosing one of these
tools and getting familiar with it for

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.010
future exercises.
