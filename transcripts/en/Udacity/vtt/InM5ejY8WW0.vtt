00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.000
Following a few principles,
we make forms a breeze for your users.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.590
Which ultimately means
more conversions for you.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.410
One, make forms as short and
sweet as possible.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.590
Avoid making any redundant information
and auto-fill as much as possible.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.723
Two, provide helpful prompts.

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.485
In the last lesson you did
it with the label elements.

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:27.807
Three, provide immediate feedback.

00:00:27.807 --> 00:00:31.604
Feedback comes in many different shapes.

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:37.245
In the last lesson, you get feedback
on an input with an instant validation.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.995
In this lesson, you'll use progress
bar to provide feedback on the users

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:42.818
progress through the entire form.

00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:43.554
You can learn about these principles and
more through the link in

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:45.836
the instructor notes.
Now that these principles are fresh in

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:48.974
your mind, Ken is going to help
you do some brainstorming.
