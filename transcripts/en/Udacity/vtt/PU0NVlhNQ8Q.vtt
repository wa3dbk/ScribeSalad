00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.075
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If we look back at our original equation, 6x minus 5 over 7 minus 3x equals 4

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:10.470
minus 8x over 4x plus 2, what does each side individually simplify to if we plug

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.619
in the value of x that we just calculated? So substitute in 19 over 30 in each

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.539
spot of x for the left-hand side first and then enter the answer that, that

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.584
equals here, and then the right-hand side.
