00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
We have only so far been able to touch on the very basic concepts

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.920
of designing intelligent search trees.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.960
And research to date is much more advanced.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.930
So you might be wondering, considering the state of the art, how low can you go?

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.320
What are the best search tree algorithms to date that we know of?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.000
Actually, I'm not going to tell you anything about vertex cover for now

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.370
because that problem will deserve a little more attention later in this unit.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.730
I will show you the state of the art for some other problems.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.840
So for independent set there are currently 2 algorithms

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.770
that could kind of be considered to be the smallest search trees.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.730
One has size 1.189 to the power of N,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.200
and the other one has size 1.211 to the power of N.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.010
It's 2 different algorithms.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.170
This here has a bit larger search tree, but the algorithm itself is probably a little bit faster

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.110
in the worst case than this one here because of the polynomial factors that are involved.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.320
But this here is just the search tree size.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.780
For clique it's the same as independent set, as always,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.540
because of the close connectedness of those 2 problems.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.090
In one of the previous units you also got to know 3 SAT,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.319
which is a satisfiability problem where every clause has exactly 3 variables,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.620
and that can be solved with a search tree of 1.496 to the power of N last time I checked.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.250
This is a very advanced search tree.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.740
It's basically half a book of proofs required to show this here.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.750
Now, what about shortest tour or, more generally, the traveling salesman problem,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.240
which is shortest tour, only that you can only visit a city exactly once.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.940
This is a very interesting one because the best--

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.170
well, it's not even really a search tree--but the best algorithm has an exponential factor

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.060
of 2 to the power of N.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.730
So here it's still an open research problem to find out

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.840
if you can design better search algorithms for this problem.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.240
By the way, in case you're wondering, do the laws of NP completeness,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.000
as far as we know them, say anything about how low the exponent can go,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.340
so really put a limit on the space here?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.570
Say, for example, unless P equals NP, there is no algorithm for independent set

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.360
with a search tree that is smaller than 1.1 to the power of N or something like that.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.960
And the answer here is we don't know.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.610
So it might be that you can solve independent set, for example,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470
in an algorithm with 1.01 to the power of N as your search tree size.

00:02:14.470 --> 99:59:59.000
Nothing in the laws of NP completeness that would speak against that.
