Let's say we have a simple page fragment with this

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.427
HTML and two CSS rules on the left that we

00:00:06.427 --> 00:00:09.990
need to match. I've also drawn the CSS object model

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.070
on the right that corresponds to these two rules. Do you

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.800
think there's any difference in how much work the browser

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
would have to do to match these two rules against the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.830
DOM? Also, while you think about that, write a sentence

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.530
or two in the box about why you picked your answer.
