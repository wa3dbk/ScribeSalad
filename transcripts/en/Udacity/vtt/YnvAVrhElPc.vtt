00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.876
Our plus or minus here means that we can either have negative 5 plus the root of

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:09.431
1 over 2 as our value of x. Or we can have negative 5 minus the root of 1 over

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:14.246
2. Let's figure out what each of these numbers actually is. Well, the root of 1

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:18.640
is just 1. So this number should be negative 2 and this number should be

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.426
negative 3.
