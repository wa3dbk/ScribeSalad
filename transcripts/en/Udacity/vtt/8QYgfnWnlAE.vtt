00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.818
The final strategy we'll look at,

00:00:02.818 --> 00:00:07.344
is a combination of server side
rendering and making an AJAX request.

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:10.866
Instead of pre-rendering
the data into the markup,

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.630
the server injects the data
into the app's JavaScript.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.680
Because it keeps the data
separate from the user interface,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.140
it works well with the app shell model.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.080
We've eliminated the need for
an extra HTTP request.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.340
But, we still need to run a little bit
JavaScript in order to display the data.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.080
Then when things have cached,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.810
we can ignore that bit and easily make
an AJAX request for more recent data
