00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.657
The standard error we've been using assumes that the samples are approximately

00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:08.410
the same size. We must correct for the sample size first by pooling the

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.623
variances. So now, we're going to slightly change the standard error that we've

00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:16.820
been using. The pooled variance, which we'll denote S sub p squared, because

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.596
remember that S squared was the variance and S was the standard deviation, is

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:24.313
the average of the two sample variances that corrects for different sample

00:00:24.313 --> 00:00:31.646
sizes. Remember when we had one sample that the variance was the sum of squares

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:35.806
divided by the degrees of freedom, which written out is the sum of this squared

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:41.633
deviations divided by n minus 1. With pooled variances, we're doing almost the

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:46.116
same thing. When we have two samples, we'll add the sum of squares for each,

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:51.026
and then divide by the sum of the degrees of freedom. Let's go through an

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:56.089
example. Let's say we have two samples, which we'll call x and y. We want to

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.452
know if the populations that these samples are from are significantly

00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:04.572
different. First, find the sum of squares for each. Remember that to do this

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:08.478
you'll have to find each deviation from the mean, and then, square them, and

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:13.370
then add them up. You're welcome to write each deviation and squared deviation

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.503
in these columns, but you don't have to. We just provide the boxes there, so

00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:22.740
that that can help you as you calculate the sum of squares. But you can always

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.738
use technology, Excel or R/g, or whatever you want to use. Or you can just do

00:01:27.738 --> 00:01:32.888
it by hand rather than typing them in. Whatever is easiest, as long as you get

00:01:32.888 --> 00:01:34.780
these sum of squares.
