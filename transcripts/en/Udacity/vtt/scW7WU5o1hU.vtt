00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.183
In this unit, we will look at solving equations and inequalities. We'll consider

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:07.974
how many solutions or answers exist for a given problem, and we'll work on

00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:12.070
writing expressions with variables. By the end of this unit, I hope you'll have

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:15.948
a greater understanding of solving for unknowns, and how to be confident in

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.988
knowing you have the right answer, and checking your work. Alright, let's get

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.405
started.
