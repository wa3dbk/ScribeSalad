00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Suppose you just have filled a new problem report.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What happens next?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In a problem database like Bugzilla,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the problem goes through a number of stages.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Initially the problem report is unconfirmed.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If all the information in the problem report is valid,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
then it goes into the new state.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
A manager or the software change control board assigns the bug to an individual developer

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
who now works on it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The developer now resolves the problem,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and for resolving the developer can choose between multiple resolutions.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
be fixed, meaning that the problem has actually been addressed.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The problem can be marked as a duplicate,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
meaning that the problem already exists somewhere else in the database

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and therefore possibly somebody else is already working on it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The problem can have a resolution of invalid,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
meaning that the problem is not a problem

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or does not contain the relevant facts.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
A resolution of won't fix means that the problem will never be fixed,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is a somewhat sad outcome for the one who originally submitted it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Then we have works for me as a resolution,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
meaning that the developer could not reproduce the problem.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Note that if the bug report is invalid or a duplicate

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
this may also be found out at an earlier stage of this,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and the problem immediately gets resolved, of sorts.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If the resolution is fixed, then the fix will typically be verified by the quality assurance team

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and as soon as the final product finally ships with the fix in it,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
then the bug report is marked as closed.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In case the problem reoccurs again,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
it goes into a state of reopened and then needs to be reassigned to a developer.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This can also happen from the resolved state.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If additional information becomes available, for instance,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that makes the original resolution obsolete.
