00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.680
So now let's see if we understood what are all the things that happen in

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.820
one cycle in [UNKNOWN] algorithm. Suppose that this is the situation we have at

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.250
the beginning of a cycle. We have an instruction that is waiting to be issued in

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.240
the instruction queue. This is the contents of the RAT. These are the values for

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.580
the Registers. These are the Reservation Stations. Two of them are occupied.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.070
One is still available. And the instruction in the reservation station 0 is

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.810
executing in the ALU and during this cycle it will broadcast it's result.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.930
Which is 4.4. This is what is allowed to happen in the same cycle,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
issuing and then dispatching the instruction cannot happen in the same cycle.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.655
Capturing a result and then dispatching can happen in this particular processor.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:58.920
And then, issuing and broadcasting of a result for the same RAT entry,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.161
is of course, also allowed. The first part of this quiz

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:09.603
is at the end of the cycle. Whose beginning we are looking at here.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:14.400
What will be the content of the two RAT entries and the two registers?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.710
So after the end of this cycle, what's going to be here, here, here, and here?
