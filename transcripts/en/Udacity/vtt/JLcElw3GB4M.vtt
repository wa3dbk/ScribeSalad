00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.965
What do you think we would need to add to each of these polynomials to make a

00:00:02.965 --> 00:00:06.725
perfect square? You want to think about drawing out a diagram like we did

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:09.785
before, and then seeing how many one pieces you will need to complete the

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:15.398
square. And don't be fooled by these negative signs here. Even if the x term is

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:19.761
negative, we'll still add a positive amount to complete the square. So, what do

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:24.160
you think for each of these? Take some time to think about it, and good luck.
