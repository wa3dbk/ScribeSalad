00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.050
So let's continue to look at aperture.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.830
Here I've just schematically shown you f/2.8 to f/16, larger

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.160
aperture opening, smaller number, smaller aperture opening, larger number.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.891
So the f number here is 16, the f number here is 2.8.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:21.351
more, the larger the opening, more the light will enter the sensor,

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:25.206
smaller the opening, less the light will enter the sensor,

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:31.120
assuming we keep the fixed same amount of shutter time, of the shutter speed.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.810
So, just by looking at it, we should be able to discern that, if I double the N,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.510
it would reduce the area by 2 times, and therefore,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.110
it would reduce the light by 4 times.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.280
So let's look at a specific example.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.830
We will look at f/2.8 and f/5.6, where the end number has doubled.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.544
So going from f/2.8 to f/5.6 will cut the light by four times.

00:00:58.544 --> 00:01:00.383
And you can actually look at the math and

00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:03.188
figure this one out on your own as to why that's happening.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:06.654
Partly it has something to do with the fact that you have a square of

00:01:06.654 --> 00:01:10.210
this value that's going to impact the size of the area.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.936
If you want to cut the light by two times,

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:17.819
basically what you need to do is increase the N by the square root of 2.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.710
So that basically starts kind of giving us a sense as to why these

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.661
numbers are there.

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.330
And again, you can do the same math between f/4 and f/8, or

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.360
f/8 and f/16, to be able to get a four times reduction of light.
