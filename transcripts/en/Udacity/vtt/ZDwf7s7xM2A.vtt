00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.201
Our equation for profit is looking really good. Except, right now, I have no

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:08.526
idea what m is equal to. Remember that m is just the money that Grant has spent.

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:12.942
Now, we've talked many times before about how the money that Grant spends is

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:17.492
going to be a combination of fixed costs, like his rent, for example, and costs

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:22.219
that scaled the number of items that he makes or the manufacturing costs. Let's

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:27.029
say that each glasses wiper set costs $10 to make, and that Grant makes exactly

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.556
as many wiper sets as he sells. In addition, all these fixed costs together,

00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:35.937
equal $20,000 per month. If all of this is the case, then how shall we change

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:40.365
the equation for Grant's profit each month? I'd like you to first calculate m,

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:44.397
the money that Grant spends each month, and then plug this value for n into the

00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:48.410
equation that we had for p before. Then, simplify to get your final answer. I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.253
know this is a lot to think about in one problem and there are several steps

00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:56.782
here. So, just make sure you go through things slowly, take everything one step

00:00:56.782 --> 00:01:00.212
at a time, and write all of your work down on a piece of paper.
