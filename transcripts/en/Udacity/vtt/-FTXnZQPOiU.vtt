00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.250
And assuming that cost is flat that we can really lower that

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.590
curve then teher are a few interesting consequences. First of all upfront

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.330
work becomes a liability, we pay for speculative work some of which

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.320
is likely to be wrong. Some of which we are likely to undo

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.870
and the reason for ambiguity and volability for example in requirements then

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.310
it's good to delay We don't want to plan for something that

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.380
might never happen, to invest resources in something that we might have

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.170
to throw away later on. In general, if cost is flat it is

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.820
cost effective to delay all decisions until the last possible

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.990
moment and only pay for what we use, so to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.550
speak. In other words, there is value in waiting, time

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.810
answers questions and removes uncertainty. And we want to take advantage

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.610
of that. This and other considerations led to the birth

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.590
of Agile Softer Development. Specifically for those of you who are

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.200
interested in a little bit of history. In February 2001

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.430
a group of software developers, 17 of them, met to discuss

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.950
lightweight development methods and published Manifesto for Agile

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.630
Software Developement. Which introduces and defines the concept of

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.990
agile software development, or agile methods. In a

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.770
nutshell, agile methods aim at flat cost and a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.190
decrease in traditional overhead by following a set

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.400
of important principles. Our first principle is to focus

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.700
on the code, rather than the design, to avoid

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.080
unnecessary changes. Another principle is to focus on people,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.100
value people over process, and make sure to reward people.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.990
In addition agile methods are all based on iterative approaches to

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.310
software development, to deliver working software quickly, and to be

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.230
evolve it Just as quickly based on feedback. And feedback can

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.740
come from many sources, in particular, it'll come from the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.500
customer, it'll be customer feedback. And to be able to do

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.040
so, agile methods need to involve the customer throughout the development

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.260
process. Finally, there are two more principles I want to mention.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.620
Which are cornerstones of agile methods. The first

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.520
one is the expectation that requirements will change, and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.010
therefore, we need to be able to handle some

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.570
changes. We can't count on the requirements to be

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.890
still and unmutable. And the last principle is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.430
the mentality of simplicity. Simple design and simple code

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.810
and so on. But be careful, because simple does

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.060
not mean inadequate, but rather, as simple as possible.
