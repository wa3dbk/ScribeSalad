00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.628
Here's our trusty book class again. And we're adding a method,

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:07.473
getSecondSentence. Last time we could just use the zero as the beginning, but

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:12.548
this time we're going to need to start where the first one left off. So we

00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:16.794
calculate the beginning the same way we calculated the end. But then start

00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:21.310
right after the period instead of at it. To get the end of the sentence, we'll

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.870
need to use a different version of the indexOf method. We're still looking for

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.142
a period. But now we want to start at the beginning of our sentence, that we're

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:33.940
working on. And now we use the sub string method the same way as we did before.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.826
And return book text dot sub string from begining of sentence to end of

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:42.512
sentence plus one. I added a couple lines to the book tester, so we can

00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:46.232
actually test our second sentence method, and now I'll run the book tester

00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:52.900
again. Here's the result. I don't remember the second sentence by heart, let's

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.562
look at the Alice text again. It looks like the second sentences match, good

00:00:58.562 --> 00:01:00.000
work.
