00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.420
What about unsupervised learning?

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.939
&gt;&gt; Right, so unsupervised learning
we don't get those examples.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.750
We have just essentially
something like input, and

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.720
we have to derive some structure
from them just by looking at

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.595
the relationship between
the inputs themselves.

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:17.669
&gt;&gt; Right so give me an example of that.

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:18.280
&gt;&gt; So.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.445
When you're studying different kinds
of animals, say, even as a kid.

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:27.540
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; You might start to say, oh,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.310
there's these animals that
all look kind of the same.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.270
They're all four-legged.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.020
I'm going to call all of them dogs.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.050
Even if they happen to be horses,
or cows, or whatever.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410
But I have developed,
without anyone telling me,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.030
this sort of notion that all
these belong in the same class.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.339
And it's different
from things like trees.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.700
Which don't have four legs.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.340
&gt;&gt; Well some do, but I mean, they have,
they both bark, is all I'm saying.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.990
&gt;&gt; Did I really set you up for that?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.870
&gt;&gt; Not on purpose.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.880
&gt;&gt; I, I'm sorry, I want to apologize
to each and every one of you for that.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.180
But that was pretty good.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.580
Michael is very good at word play.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.670
Which I guess is often
unsupervised as well.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.871
No, I get a lot of [LAUGH].

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.060
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You certainly
get a lot of feedback.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.520
So I say, please stop doing that.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.960
&gt;&gt; So if supervised learning is
about function approximation,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.540
then unsupervised learning
is about description.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.360
It's about taking a set of data and

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.160
figuring out how you might divide
it up in one way or the other.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.470
&gt;&gt; Or maybe even summarization
it's not just the description but

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.430
it's a shorter description.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's usually concise.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.510
Compression.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.850
&gt;&gt; Compact description.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.355
So I might take a bunch of pixels
like I have here it might say, male.

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:26.810
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.590
I'm pixels now?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.570
&gt;&gt; As far as we can tell.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.620
&gt;&gt; That's fine.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.560
&gt;&gt; I however, am not pixels.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.440
I know I'm not pixels.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.560
I'm pretty sure the rest
of you are pixels.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.770
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; So I have a bunch of pixels, and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.252
I might say male.

00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:37.750
And or I might say female.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.970
Or I might say dog.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.160
Or I might say tree.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.030
But, the point is I don't have a bunch
of labels that say dog, tree, male,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.550
or female.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.790
I just decide that pixels like
this belong with pixels like this.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.980
As opposed to pixels like something
else that I'm pointing to behind me.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah we're living in a world right
now that is devoid of any other objects.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.660
Oh, chairs!

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.400
&gt;&gt; Chairs!
Right.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.940
So these pixels are very different
than those pixels because of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.870
where they are relative
to the other pixels.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.170
Say, right?

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.960
So, if you were looking-

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.250
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure that's helping me
understand unsupervised learning.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.190
&gt;&gt; Go out and, go outside and

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.190
look at a crowd of people and try to
decide how you might divide them up.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.830
Maybe you'll divide
them up by ethnicity.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.840
Maybe you'll divide them up by
whether they have purposefully shaven

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.560
their hair in order to mock the bald or
whether they have curly hair.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.880
Maybe you'll divide them
up by whether they have

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.540
goatees,
&gt;&gt; Facial hair.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.492
&gt;&gt; Or whether they have grey hair,

00:02:25.492 --> 00:02:27.020
there's lots of things that
you might do in order,.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.560
&gt;&gt; Did you just point at me and
say grey hair?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.300
&gt;&gt; I was pointing and
your head happened to be there.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.970
&gt;&gt; Oh come on.
&gt;&gt; Pixels,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.510
&gt;&gt; Where's the grey hair?

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.361
&gt;&gt; It's a two dimensional, right there,
it's right where your spit curl is.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.120
All right.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.640
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So, imagine you're dividing the world

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.390
up that way.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.710
You could divide it up male, female.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.486
You could divide it up short, tall,
wears hats, doesn't wear hats,

00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:44.980
all kinds of ways you can divide it up.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.750
And no one's telling you the right way
to divide it up, at least not directly.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.690
That's unsupervised learning.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.100
That's description, because now-

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.635
&gt;&gt; Mm.
&gt;&gt; Rather than having to send pixels of

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:56.786
everyone, or having to do a complete
description of this crowd,

00:02:56.786 --> 00:03:00.264
you can say there were 57 males and
23 females say.

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:02.888
Or there are mostly people with beards.

00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:04.071
&gt;&gt; So on.
&gt;&gt; Or whatever.

00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:05.105
&gt;&gt; I like summarization for that.

00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:05.651
That seems good.

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.233
&gt;&gt; I like summarization for that.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.489
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's a nice concise description.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.266
That's unsupervised learning.

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:09.165
&gt;&gt; Good.
Very good.

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:09.849
&gt;&gt; And practice.
&gt;&gt; And that's different from

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.410
supervised learning?

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.630
&gt;&gt; It's different in supervised learning
and it's different in a couple of ways.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.400
One way that it's different
is all of those ways that we

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.600
could have just divided up the world.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.530
In some sense are all equal either.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.780
So I could divide up by sex or

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.660
I could divide up by height or I could
divide up by clothing or whatever.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.700
And they're all equally good absent
some other signal later telling you

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.170
how you should be dividing up the world.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.920
But supervised learning directly
tells you there's a signal.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.925
This is what it ought to be,
and that's how you train.

00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:39.550
And those are very different.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.420
&gt;&gt; Now, but I could see ways that
unsupervised learning could be helpful

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420
in the supervised setting, right?

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.660
So if I do get a nice description, and
it's the right kind of description,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.930
it might help me map to, it may help me
do the function approximation better.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.265
&gt;&gt; Right, so instead of taking
pixels that input, as input, and,

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:55.110
and labels like, male or female.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.871
I could just simply take a summarization
of you like how much hair do

00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:59.892
you have your relative height,
the weight, and

00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:01.990
various things like that
that might help me do it.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.740
That's right.
And by the way,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.490
in practice this turns out to be
things like density estimation.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.910
We do end up turning it into
statistics at the end of the day.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.820
Often.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.020
&gt;&gt; But
it's statistics from the beginning.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.930
But when you say density estimation.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.010
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Are you saying I'm stupid?

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.901
No.
&gt;&gt; All right so

00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:20.670
what is density estimation?

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.040
&gt;&gt; Well they'll have to
take the class to find out.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.660
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.160
&gt;&gt; Okay
