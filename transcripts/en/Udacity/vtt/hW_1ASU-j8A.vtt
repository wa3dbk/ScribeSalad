00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.200
After all this work, let's use our model to make

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.060
a prediction. We need to exponentiate the result of our

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.820
model. Since we took the log of price. Let's take

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.870
a look at an example from Blue Nile. We'll use

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.150
the full model m5, to predict the value of the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.080
diamond. Try to understand what this code does. If you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.200
see something you don't understand, look it up in the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.713
documentation, then answer the question. Evaluate how well the model predicts

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:29.420
the Blue Nile diamond price. Think about the fitted point estimate. As

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.216
well as, the lower and upper bound of the 95% confidence interval.
