00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.831
There is a possibility though that you really, really hate fractions. I mean,

00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:07.791
really hate them, like you don't want to deal with them at all. This method over

00:00:07.803 --> 00:00:11.589
here then is probably not quite your cup of tea. So, there is a different way

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:15.283
that you go about solving this problem. And that way would be to start out by

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:19.058
getting rid of the fraction that's over here on the left-hand side. So, what do

00:00:19.058 --> 00:00:23.213
I need to do on each side of the equation right now, in order to end up with the

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:27.242
next version of it having no fractions in it, whatsoever? Please fill in that

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:28.560
operation in these boxes.
