00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.750
So just a little bit more
detail of how TOR works.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.230
So it's called onion routing,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.680
is what I think the example we had was
sort of doing something like that.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.430
It uses onion routing.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.300
So to start,
the client we are talking about

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.560
uses a director service to
get a set of TOR nodes.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.720
These nodes would then help us route
the message from Alice to Bob's website.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.610
You pick a random set and
order it, so the message is

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.958
going to go from one to the next
in the order that we come up with.

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.790
Alice is going to prepare her message
and creates these onion layers,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.420
so in the end it's going to
go to Bob's website, but

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.080
then we know it's going to be sent
to Bob's website by the last node.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.150
And its predecessor is going to send
it to that and things like that,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.830
so the onion layers that we're talking
about essentially, when you peel one,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.200
you know where it goes next,
okay, but that's all.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.360
You don't see any further down
through the layers beyond that.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.680
So we peel one layer.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.870
We know who to send it to next in
this order that we're talking about.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.220
And that node is going to peel another
layer, and send it to Its successor, and

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.700
we're going to continue like that.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.680
And this peeling of the layers actually
is done through encryption using keys,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.530
you encrypted with someone's public key.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.790
So, only they can decrypt it because
they have the corresponding private key,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.900
and that's how this thing works.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140
So that's anonymous communication.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.998
Well, you can, Alice doesn't
have to say that it's Alice

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:34.712
if Bob's website demands some
sort of identity for her.

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:38.149
You can create sort of fictional or
pseudo identities,

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.352
you can have multiple one of those.

00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:45.190
So somebody when you switch your
identity they can't say that Alice is

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.028
doing A, B, and C, if you switched
after A, then whoever is tracking

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:55.000
would think B is being done by somebody
other than whoever had done A.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.029
So, psuedo-anonymity is not a way
by which we tried to sort of defeat

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:05.508
the tracking and making the kind of
inferences that we're talking about.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.814
And of course,
we talked about aggregation and

00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:13.691
privacy enhancing transformations
like anonymization of data, and

00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:18.675
diversity in data, so someone is
not able to inference back to you.

00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:22.925
This must be some information
about you and things like that, so

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:26.110
the variety of this technologies and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.140
techniques that one can use to
improve privacy to if not defeat,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.490
at least reduce that effectiveness
of tracking, and that happens in

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.390
collection of information that can
be tied to a particular identity.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.530
This technology sort of
helps us disrupt that.
