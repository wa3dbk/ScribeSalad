00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Resegmented market--well, you have a hypothesis about who the customers are--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that is you think you understand what your fit is, either in the low cost

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or there are specific in each needs and so you might have a better fit for them.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And competitors, there's many if you're wrong but very few if you're right,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and your risk is that you get the market and product redefinition just wrong.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You didn't do enough customer discovery and you say--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"No, no, no. This is how we're going to enter this existing market.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We're going to go after these set of usuals specifically," and oops, you are wrong.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A great example of this is what Southwest did.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Southwest took on the airline industry by bringing up the traditional hub-and-spoke model

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and providing just very limited services but for an extremely low price.
