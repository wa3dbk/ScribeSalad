00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.141
Here's the correct answer, and great job if you got it right. We can factor a 2

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:10.125
a from the first two terms to give us 2 a times a plus 4. The second two terms

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:15.233
share a b, so we can factor that out, leaving us with b times a plus 4. Now this

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:20.399
term and this term share an a plus 4, so we can factor that out, leaving us with

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.045
2 a plus b. And here are our two factors.
