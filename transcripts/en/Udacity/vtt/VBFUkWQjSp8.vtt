00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.510
The profile class is in the package com.google.devrel.training.conference.domain

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.050
and the conference API class is in com.google.devre.training.conference.spi.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.090
Now the conference API class contains functions that are

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.050
exposed through endpoints and you'll see that the package it's in is spi.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.200
A convention has developed to use SPI to indicate endpoints.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.580
I think it's got something to do with

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.950
the original internal name for the endpoints project at

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.590
Google but don't quote me on that but just

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.830
remember when you see spi it usually means endpoints.
