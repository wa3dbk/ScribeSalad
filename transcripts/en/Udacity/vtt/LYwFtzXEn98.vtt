00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.140
I save my code, stop and start my server
again, and visit the slash hello page.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.080
And look.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.160
Now my server responds to my input, so

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.790
I can make it say hello
in any language I'd like.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.980
Get this server up and
running on your machine.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.180
Feel free to use the code in
the instructor notes as reference.
