In addition to the evolutionary model of motivation, we also have what's called

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:08.194
the drive reduction model. And, if you remember from lesson three, we talked

00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:12.794
about the brain and homeostasis. And homeostasis is at the center of the drive

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:17.542
reduction model. Now, this model states that our bodies will strive to maintain

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:22.660
homeostasis. Psychologists have suggested that we have what's called a set

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.002
point and a set point is an ideal fixed setting of a physiological system. Such

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:33.094
as our temperature or even our respiration. Now our brains have the ability to

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:36.922
detect our physiological states and in turn our brains can activate a feedback

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:42.810
system that helps the body maintain physiological states. At their ideal set

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.380
point. Let's take a look at an example. Let's say you find yourself in the

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.110
Upper Peninsula of Michigan in January, without a hat, coat, or shoes. Now,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.391
that's a very cold place to be. According to the drive reduction model, what

00:00:56.391 --> 00:01:01.132
would happen to your body? Well, first your brain would detect those changes in

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:05.068
your physiological states. Most notably temperature and it would start a

00:01:05.068 --> 00:01:09.144
cascade of events that would allow you to try to increase your temperature. For

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:13.350
example, you may rub your hands together. Rub your hands on your arms to warm

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.406
yourself up. Jump up and down or even eventually begin to shiver. So this

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:22.365
demonstrates how our body detects the change in our temperature. And it being

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:25.415
outside of the ideal set point, and allowed you to do things to try to raise

00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:27.300
that temperature.
