00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.930
Okay, so

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.141
when I'm looking at every element in
this matrix, I'm looking at least once.

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:10.630
So I'm thinking the runtime
will be n times m,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.240
where n is the number of rows and
m is the number of columns.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.322
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
that sounds like a good analysis.

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:20.600
&gt;&gt; Well, this seems like
the most optimal solution.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.600
So I think I'm going to jump in and
start coding now

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.800
&gt;&gt; Awesome let's do it.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.680
Hear the interviewee analyze
the steps to his algorithm and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.900
calculated the Big O runtime.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.900
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.790
This is an important step because
he may realize that his solution is

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.300
not optimal while analyzing run time but
in this case it actually was optimal.
