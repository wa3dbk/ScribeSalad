Here's our answer. Great algebra skills if you found that one out. First we

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:09.990
distribute our negative sign to each term in our numerator. So we'll have plus

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.457
negative two b plus five. Make sure you change that sign there. Next we find the

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:20.852
lowest common denominator, which is b plus two, times b minus two, times b plus

00:00:20.852 --> 00:00:25.874
five. Next we multiply each fraction by a form of one. This denominator was

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:31.314
missing b plus 5, and this denominator was missing b plus 2. Next we multiply

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:37.356
these two numerators together, to get b squared plus 8b plus 15. For the second

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:42.368
equivalent fraction, we'll multiply negative 2b plus 5, times b plus 2. This

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:46.904
gives us this trinomial, and finally we add the like terms of each numerator

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:53.719
together. B squared and negative 2b squared equals negative 1b squared. 8b and

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.800
positive b equal 9b and 15 and 10 equal 25. So this is our final answer. We also

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.946
know that this is our final answer because we can't factor this enumerator

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:09.574
further. There are no factors of negative 25. That's sum to positive nine. I

00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:14.162
hope you've gained a lot of practice with adding and subtracting rational

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:15.113
expressions.
