00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.920
The best way to do this would be to give caffeine in varying amounts to

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.160
different groups of employees. Then measure their reaction time. The first

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.680
option and the third option are both correlational studies. We don't want to

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.020
use those if we want to see if caffeine effects reaction time. So look at this

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.440
last one. This one uses what we call a self report measure. We're going to talk

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.580
more about that later, but it's not a very good way to measure reaction time.
