00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.874
One cool thing you can do with a square that has a transparency map is to

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:06.596
create a bunch of these and have them move around. When a large number of

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:10.772
objects like this move around we call them particles. This demo has 100,000

00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:15.175
particles. One particular useful way to display particles is as if they're 2D

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:20.306
objects flat on the screen. The objects are actually in a 3D world, however. As

00:00:20.306 --> 00:00:23.486
the camera moves, these objects are reoriented so that they always face

00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:27.788
forward. In this example, we see squares moving about with each square always

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:31.437
facing the viewer. You can then apply texture with an alpha channel to get an

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:34.996
interesting look. By using transparency mapping, you can put whatever you want

00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:39.185
on a particle. Here are a bunch of dots moving around. An advantage of

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:42.798
particles is that they can directly represent 3D scan to data. For example,

00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:47.560
here's some movement data captured using a connect as displayed with particles.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.374
Some researchers and developers are actively looking at how to use particles as

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:54.565
basic building blocks instead of triangles. Here's an example from Markus

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:57.727
Shuetz on his potree.org site that shows a realistic view made entirely of

00:00:57.727 --> 00:01:03.500
particles. This data was captured by a laser scan system by Faro Technologies.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.815
One advantage of particle systems is that data can be captured by a scanner and

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:11.288
then directly viewed. No processing is needed to reconstruct any triangles or

00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:14.668
meshes. This program is running in the browser with more particles flowing in

00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:19.050
and filling in the gaps the longer you view it. That's one advantage of

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.982
particles, you can stream them in as you wish, bit by bit. With triangles, you

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.742
tend to send in either some simplified mesh or the whole object, causing

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:29.723
objects to pop into existence. The particles themselves can be made to look

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:34.071
more realistic. You can use any texture you want when you're doing transparency

00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.665
mapping. By using a sphere texture instead of a circle, these particles are

00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:42.230
more convincing as 3D objects. Weather is a common use for particle systems for

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.966
making snow flakes or rain drops. For phenomena like rain, particles can have a

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:48.927
lifetime where they're created, fall through the sky, and when they hit the

00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:54.416
ground, they disappear. Particles usually face the viewer. This idea of having

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:58.760
objects always face forward is called billboarding. It allows us to make 2D

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.829
textures seem more like 3D objects, as we've seen. This demo shows a popular

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.492
use for transparent textures on billboards, simulating clouds. This demo was by

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:12.060
the main author of Three.js in fact. Larger billboards of cloud shapes are

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.635
combined and overlapped to give the illusion of puffiness. I have to conclude

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.006
with one of the cliches of computer graphics, the lens flare. It's so easy to

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.126
add this effect, that it's been in many games, though there probably have been

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:26.555
more games with crates. The sparkling patterns that simulate interaction of

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:29.610
light with the cameras parts are all transparent textures whose position are

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.449
computed on the fly.
