00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.990
The first thing we see
in the app delegate is

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
application did finish
launching with options.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.710
This happens immediately
after your app launches,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.010
this might be a good time to set up
your core data stack but not to save.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.790
After all there is nothing new
worth saving at this point.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.680
Next we have application
will resign active.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.830
This happens when the app's still in
the background but is no longer active.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.590
Not being active means user input, such
as taps, don't reach the app anymore.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.940
This happens when you're using the app
and you get a phone call, for example.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.310
This is a good moment to save.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.910
Next, we have application
did enter background.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.280
This means your app has
been sent to the background

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.820
because the user
switched to another app.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.710
This is also a good time to save.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.140
Later on we have application
will enter foreground and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.420
application did become active.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.680
These mean that your app is
back from the background,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.710
it wouldn't make much
sense to save in here.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.200
And last but not least,
we have application will terminate.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.410
Your app is about to
be killed by the OS.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.400
Either the user closed the app or
iOS decided to shut it down,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.370
this sounds like a good time to save but
actually isn't.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.060
You don't have much time
left at this point.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.030
You may want to do a print goodbye cruel
world, but anything else is risky.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.080
Why not saving immediately
after creating a new note?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.480
In this case it would be okay,
as our data model is very simple.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.260
However, in a more complex app,
it's better not to overdo it and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.785
save too often, unless you know
how to do it in the background.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:54.990
We'll look at how to do that later.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.990
So this was all very informative but
we still don't have a concrete answer.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.980
If saving every time we change
something is too much saving and saving

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.009
only when the app goes to the background
or becomes inactive, it's too little.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.070
What's the best solution?
