00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.740
Early versions of Android didn't have the loader

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.310
pattern. It was added to avoid directly querying the

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.830
database from the UI code. What are the disadvantages

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.080
in directly querying the database from the UI code?

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.630
The query could take a long time. It could

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.630
be terminated before it completes. Or there are no disadvantages.
