00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.898
Now you're going to take a little true or false quiz that might be a little

00:00:03.898 --> 00:00:08.119
tricky, and it'll get you thinking more about the mode. Do you think this is

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.381
true or false? Can the mode be used to describe any type of data, numerical or

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:17.107
categorical? True or false that all scores in the in the data set affect the

00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:21.809
mode. Or, if we have a population, and we take a lot of samples from this

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:27.117
population, and we find the mode in each sample, the mode'll be about the same.

00:00:27.117 --> 00:00:32.244
True or false? And finally, there is an equation for the mode. Is that true or

00:00:32.244 --> 00:00:32.741
false?
