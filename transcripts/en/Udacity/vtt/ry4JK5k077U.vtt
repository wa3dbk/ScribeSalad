00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.297
The first thing that we need to do to isolate t is to divide both sides by

00:00:04.297 --> 00:00:10.137
negative 0.5. When we do that we get t equals the natural log of 5 over 1000

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:16.746
divided by negative 0.5. Now it's time to bring back my calculator. And here it

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:21.800
is. Let's plug this right hand side in to see what number we get. So, first

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.135
you'll take the natural log, using this ln key of 5 divided by 1000. Then I

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:34.693
want you to divide that by negative 0.5. I press equals and, voila. We have

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:43.035
10.5966347331. So rounding off of my calculator's answer. T is about equal to

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:48.728
10.6. So, it's going to take 10.6 hours, or about 10 hours and 36 minutes, for

00:00:48.728 --> 00:00:52.479
there only to be 5 bacteria left.
