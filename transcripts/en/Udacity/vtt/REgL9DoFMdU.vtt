00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One last concept I'd like to discuss regarding indexes

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is for using them for sorting.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So far we've been talking about using a hashtable

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to create an index,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but one of the characteristics of a hashtable is that it's not sorted.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A hashtable is just a mapping of keys to values,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and if you remember how they're implemented,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
they're implemented as a big array

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with all these fields,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and inside these fields are these keys that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
are basically the hashed version of sum value.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you add a new element into your hashtable,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the new element can go into any one of these cells.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It could be the case that this key was added last.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It just happens that that key hashed to this position zero in the hashtable.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we lose our sorting information when we use a hashtable.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And we saw some SQL queries before that used the order by statement.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Obviously that requires some sort of sorting.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So there's a different type of mapping we can use, and this is called a tree.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Trees are a basic data structure

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that accomplish something similar to a hashtable,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but they have the nice property that they are sorted.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Why would you ever use a hashtable when you can use a tree instead?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Well, the downside is that the lookups are slower.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Hashtable's lookups are faster.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So I don't think we've talked about these algorithms yet in 101,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but basically a hash table has constant time lookup,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which means that generally looking up any particular key

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in our hashtable is not a function of the number of keys in the hashtable.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Their inserting can be a little hazardous.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Remember those collisions. I think you talked about that in 101.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But in general, the lookups are going to be constant time.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And in a tree, the lookups are going to be roughly a function of log n,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
where n is the number of elements in a tree.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So lookup speed decreases with

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the size of the tree.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And depending on what you're going to use your index for,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you may choose to use a hashtable or a tree.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Many databases let you choose.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Some actually don't, or some choose for you.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Interesting property of indexes used by most relational databases

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
is that they preserve sorting,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and there's some cool things we can do with that.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
One is that if you wanted to find all of the links in your database sorted by votes,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
if you created an index on votes,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that would be a very, very fast query.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You would just go to the front of your tree--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
your index on votes--and just read off the links.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And I'd like to show you how we use that at Reddit to make the hot algorithm work.
