00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.250
Let's look at the solution to our
SMT and cache relationship quiz.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.880
We have three programs.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.540
Program A has a working set
that doesn't fit in the cache.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.610
That means that program A will
have a lot of cache misses no

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.400
matter what we do.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.650
Program B alone would fit in the cache.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.710
Program C alone would fit in the cache.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.070
Programs B and C would fit in the cache,
but if we run all three together,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.930
then the total working set size is
15KB which doesn't fit in the cache,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.970
so all of them get poor cache behavior.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.130
So really we should not be
running all three together.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.167
We should not be running A and
B together, because

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:45.930
then C gets to run alone so
we don't benefit from SMT and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.410
B runs with A, so
B also has a lot of cache misses.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.110
We should run A and then B and C.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.340
That way,
A which has to get poor cache behavior,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.750
gets poor cache behavior alone.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.970
But B and C benefit from SMT and

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.470
fit in the cache, so
they still get good cache behavior.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.649
So we should do this.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.460
Just like we shouldn't run B with A,
we shouldn't run C with A, and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.210
then running A and then B and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.510
then C is not benefiting from SMT
although B and C would fit in the cache.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.770
So that's why this is
the only correct answer.
