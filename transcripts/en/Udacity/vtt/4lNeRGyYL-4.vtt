00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.290
Cay and I are going to help make sure you get BlueJ and the course code

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.189
installed and downloaded. Installing BlueJ will have two main parts, installing

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.500
Java and installing BlueJ. You might not notice this part if you are on a Mac.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.020
There are links below that will help guide you. There are written installation

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.930
instructions and some videos of the installation process. You'll need to pick

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.690
the right instructions for your operating system, Mac or Windows. If you can't

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.180
get BlueJ running, it's not your fault. It just means your computer's set up

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.886
differently from ours. We can help. Post your questions on the forums. Below

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:40.600
this video, there's a section called discussions. You can read other people's

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.979
questions and answer, or you can ask a question yourself. When you're asking a

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.645
question, give us as much information about what you did and what the result

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:56.190
was, as you can. The more you tell us, the clearer our advice will be. Once

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.098
you've successfully installed BlueJ, open BlueJ and go to the Help menu. Select

00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:06.472
About or Copyright, whichever one you see. Who's the first contributor on the

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:10.080
team? In other words, what's the first name that comes up?
