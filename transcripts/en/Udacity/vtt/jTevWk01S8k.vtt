One of the last things we need to implement is the ability to mute our sound.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.962
Anyone who continuously plays games at work, like Cold, knows that muting is

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:15.519
one of the single most important features that was ever devised. We want the

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.462
ability to mute and unmute. So we need to set the value of our gain node

00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:25.552
depending on whether it's muted or not. Now take a moment to implement this

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:27.200
functionality for yourself.
