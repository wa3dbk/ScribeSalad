00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.810
Another popular system file format is the extended format, commonly

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.273
used in Linux. Each file on the disk has a

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:09.440
data structure called an Inode associated with it. The Inode

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.000
is fixed length. It contains the metadata for the file, and

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.880
it serves as the glue linking the data blocks together

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.908
in the right order. It is this gluing function that

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:21.340
is the most interesting. The inode stores 15 data block

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.590
addresses or pointers. The first 12 of these point directly to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.480
the first 12 data blocks of the file. This makes

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.900
the strategy efficient for small files. The thirteenth of these

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.470
addresses points to a block that consists of a table

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.380
of addresses for the next blocks in the file. This

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.760
vastly increases the number of blocks that we can use

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.180
in a file. The downside is that we've introduced a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.120
layer of indirection. If this doesn't give the file enough

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.890
space, then we use this fourteenth pointer and not one but

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.100
two layers of indirection, giving us even more space.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.788
And if this isn't enough, we have a fifteenth pointer,

00:00:56.788 --> 00:01:00.430
which uses triple indirection for more space still. Juts

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.995
like in FAT, directories are treated as files. Only instead

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:06.395
of mapping a file name to the first file

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:09.297
block, they map a file name to its inode. That

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:13.257
path for accessing slash foo, slash file.txt, would look something

00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:15.980
like this. We'd start at the inode for the root

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.710
directory and then following its data pointers

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.200
we find the data for the root directory.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.580
There we find that foo maps to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.365
another inode, following that address we consult that

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:35.710
inode and find that address for its data block. Looking in there, we find the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.890
contents of slash foo. That's a directory. So

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.450
it's going to map the file name file.txt

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.946
to the appropriate inode. And then using that inode structure,

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:49.440
we're able to peace together the data that we need.
