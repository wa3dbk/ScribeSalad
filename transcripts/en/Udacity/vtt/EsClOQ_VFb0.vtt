So what I really love about being a data scientist,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.480
is I love that I can use data to help

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.550
these software companies out. And the reason I love that

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.710
is because at the software companies you're able to [UNKNOWN]

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.540
help build systems that scaled a hundreds of millions of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
users, that can have an enormous impact on the world.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.410
And I really love that you can bring quantitative reasoning

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.190
and quantitative thinking to help out all of the users.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.010
I love the impact.
