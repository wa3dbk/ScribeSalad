00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.480
There's a lot going on here and
some of it we have not discussed before.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.300
As an example,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.700
the exclamation marks indicate these
are implicitly unwrapped optionals.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.020
A concept in swift that you'll learn
in the UI kit fundamentals lesson

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.280
in a later part of the course.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.160
Let's break down the audio
recorder code piece by piece.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.130
You can see we first
import AVFoundation,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.970
the framework that has
AV audio recorder.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.060
Without this import, Xcode won't know
about any AVFoundation classes, and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.705
our IOS app won't compile.

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:35.610
If we scroll down to the record
audio function, here,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.700
we see what looks like the code
to get the directory path and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
build a full path,
including the file name.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.644
In the essence, this grabs the pitch
perfect's document directory and

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:49.820
stores it as a string in
the dirPath constant.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.760
Later in this course,
when we get to persistence,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.990
you'll learn the various directories and
storage locations available in IOS.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.700
For now, we just need a place
to store the audio recording and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.720
the documents directory
will work just fine.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.750
A few lines down, we make an array with
the directory path and the file name.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.280
Join those together and create
a URL to use with AVAudioRecorder.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.490
We also print out the path so
you can see it in the console.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.680
Next up, we grab the AVAudioSession and
set up the category to play and record.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.140
In order to either record or playback
audio, we need an audio session.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.650
There's just one that exists for
the entire time your app is running and

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.580
we grab it with a shared
instance method.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.670
The AV audio session class is basically
an abstraction over the audio hardware.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.640
Since there's only one audio hardware,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.035
there's only one instance
of AVAudioSession.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.870
You grab the shared instance that's
used by all apps on the iOS device.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.640
This is a common pattern you
will find in cocoa touch.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.500
When you reach into the iOS API and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.660
grab a singleton, it is usually
a function called shared instance.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.380
So with the AVAudioSession set up,
we can set up the AVAudioRecorder.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.100
Here we see the line with
AVAudioRecorder inside of a try

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.330
statement, without handling if it fails.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.520
We will cover error handling
later in this course.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.060
For now,
we can just assume it will work.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.410
We tell it to prepare recording and
start recording.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.890
That's it,
AVAudioRecorder is now recording audio.
