I think the only time that you should try to settle the P versus NP question is either

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.510
when you've had brilliant insight that hasn't be tried before and you've invented a new proof technique

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.190
that no one has shown is incapable of setting the P versus NP question,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.840
and of course if you're seasoned and respected computer scientist

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.600
with nothing to lose and enough money.

00:00:20.600 --> 99:59:59.000
I, of course, don't want to keep you from pondering this question here.
