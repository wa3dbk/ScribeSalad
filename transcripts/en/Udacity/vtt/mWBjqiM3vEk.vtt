00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.210
Here's a state transition table for

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.390
the garage door opener. Notice that there are eight rows, but only six states.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.010
That's because some of the states have two possible, transitions on them,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.712
depending upon the events of their arriving. Second column is the input,

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:21.520
as to which of those events there are. Notice that the third column has

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.770
the actions of starting and stopping the motor. And the next state is in the,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.670
in the fourth column. Well, this table can obviously get crowded as

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.880
the number of possible states and events goes up. So we'd like to at

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.330
least explore the alternative of some kind of graphical view of it
