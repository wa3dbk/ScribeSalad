00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.810
So here we're going to work
through this simple example again,

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.980
using our 4s and 9s.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.542
We're going to assume that we have
some feature that we're measuring, x.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.790
It's typically a vector, but
I'm going to show it here as a scalar.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.260
So x goes from small x,
so little x, to big x.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.780
All right?

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.720
It's changing, changing values.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.600
Clearly, all the way to the left,
I've got more 4s, and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.050
all the way to the right, I've got
more 9s at the best decision boundary.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.890
Okay?
And that's what's indicated in red here.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.970
At that boundary,
if I call it a four, or

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.990
I call it a nine,
it should cost me on average the same.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.920
Because in fact, if,
if calling it a four would

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.320
be less risk than calling a nine, I'm
going to move that boundary this way.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.860
And if cost, calling it a nine is
better than calling in a four,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.530
I'm going to move the boundary that way.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.120
So at the best possible boundary,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.930
the expected loss is the same
regardless of which label I announce.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.750
All right, so if we picked label four,
okay, at that boundary.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.120
Okay, then the expected loss is what?

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.090
Well, it's just, what is the probability
that it's really a nine,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.280
and that I call it a four,
the cost of calling it a four?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.429
And what's the probability
that it's really a four, and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.042
the loss of calling it a four?

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:31.749
Well if you remember, remember we
assumed that the loss of x to x is zero,

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:35.690
that is, there's no cost
of calling a four a four.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.320
Well that means that this
just reduces down to,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.590
well, if I'm at this location, x, what's
the probability it's really a nine?

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.390
And the cost of calling the nine a four?

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.380
That's the expected loss of
saying four at that location.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.040
Likewise, what's the expected loss,
if I say nine at that location?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.550
Well, symmetrically,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.180
it's just what is the probability
that it actually was a four?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.075
And what's the loss of
calling a four a nine?

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:05.620
Okay, so those are the two different
value, the losses, that I want.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.620
Now, remember we said before at the best
decision boundary either labeling a four

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.300
or labeling a nine, the cost,
the expected cost would be the same.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.270
So the best decision boundary is where,
is the x such

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.830
that the probability that
the class is really a nine times

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.400
the cost of calling a nine a four,
will be equal to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.570
the probability that it's really a four
times the loss of calling a four a nine.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.260
When I set those two values equal,
that's the x that I want for

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.710
my decision boundary.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.240
What that means is,
if I'm going to classify a new point,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.140
I'm just going to look at these values,
right?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.990
At some new point x.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.840
What's the probability that it's really
a four times the probability that I call

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.110
a four a nine?

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.880
If that's greater than
the probability that it's a nine

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.710
times the loss of calling a nine a four,
if that's true,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.810
I'm going to call this thing a four,
otherwise, I'm going to call it a nine.
