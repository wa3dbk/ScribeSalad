00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now x, which is the amount of length and width we're adding to the booth, is

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.927
the variable that we're going to want to solve for in this equation. Right now,

00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:11.624
we don't know how to do this. There's this x squared term, and it's kind of

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:15.560
confusing to think about what you do with that. So let's learn. First of all, I

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.709
don't like having constant terms on both sides of the equal sign. We can pretty

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:23.552
easily make that not be the case. If I want to get rid of the 300 over here on

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:27.207
the left, then what am I going to be left with on the right? Fill in this box

00:00:27.207 --> 00:00:30.983
with the expression that belongs in the right-hand side of the equation that

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:33.816
will be left after I legally get rid of 300 from the left.
