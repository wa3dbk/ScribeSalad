00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.481
Now that you've seen a couple of exponential functions, let's talk a bit more

00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:08.699
in generally about them. We use exponential functions to model relationships in

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.121
which a constant change in x creates a proportional change, a percent increase

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:18.893
or a decrease in f of x. In other words, as we saw in our tables that we worked

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:22.797
with, whenever we add a certain amount to x, we're looking at adding one every

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:29.415
time in this case. f of x is going to be multiplied by a certain amount. In the

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:33.768
case of this function, that amount was two. Now the general form of an

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:40.221
exponential function looks like this. f of x equals a to the x power. Here a is

00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:46.148
a positive constant other than 1. Before we move on, let's just look at why a

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:53.107
can't be 0 and can't be 1. Well, what is f of x if a equals 0? What if a equals

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:57.249
1? For each of these, rewrite the function as simply as possible.
