00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.660
That was the first criterion adequacy. The second property three criterion is

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.890
totality. That is our implementation can't put us in a concrete state that

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.900
doesn't correspond to an abstract one. No memory fault core dump messages.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.490
Memory fault core dump would be a concrete state. Okay? And

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.800
it doesn't correspond anything in our spec. And we want to prevent such

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.450
situations from arising. We call this criterion total or

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.250
totality because we must make sure that the retrieve function is total in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.690
the mathematical sense. That it's defined at every point. Here is how this

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.358
property looks if we express it formally. For every concrete state t,

00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:50.074
if the invariants are true on t, then it had better be the case that there

00:00:50.074 --> 00:00:56.380
exists, some kind of abstract state s. That's the result of retrieving out of t.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.910
And the invariants of the abstract invariants must hold on, on state s.
