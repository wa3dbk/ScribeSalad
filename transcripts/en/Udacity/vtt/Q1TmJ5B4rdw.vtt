00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.059
So, we need one more thing to
finish mean shift tracking.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.400
You remember before,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.380
when I was showing you the mean shift
example we were plopping down a circle,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.910
right, and I said we'll worry
later about the shape of that?

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.140
Well that circle can be thought
of as a uniform kernel.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.200
What I mean by uniform is that its
height is the same everywhere around and

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.210
it happens to have a circular shape and
it would be written like that.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.650
That's not such a great kernel, what
do you think a better kernel might be?

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.299
Well, instead of using uniform kernel
we could use something that is

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.980
differentiable, we'll use that in
a minute, isotropic, all that means is

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.310
that it's the same in every direction,
monotonically decreasing kernel and

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.560
there's a certain convexity property
we're not going to worry about that.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.200
So, so what's our favorite

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.440
differential isotropic monotonically
decreasing always positive kernel?

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.180
Yes, it's the Gaussian.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.440
Okay.
So here it's written just as a constant

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.990
proportional to a fall off by
the square of the distance, okay?

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.120
You can also have a scale factor, right?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.280
So if you wanted you could talk
about like, the sigma, sort of the,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.190
the scale of the kernel.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.380
What's really cool about this is that,
unlike the uniform kernel, which goes

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.960
straight and then falls off on the edge,
this is differentiable, okay?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.110
You can know how much it's changing, and

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.940
it also means that it goes
down to zero at the edges.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.360
So as you slide that kernel along a new
point, it just has a very, very small

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.320
weight, in fact, an infinitesimally
small weight, and then it grows.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.070
Likewise, points that are right near the
top, their weight doesn't change very

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.920
much, right, because as you slide it
along, the weight stays about the same.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.410
The points that are going to have
the greatest value are the ones that

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.470
are along the slope.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.890
What that means is,
you can know how your function

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.940
changes as you move,
that is your overall function.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.306
So, your coefficient for example,
and what you can do is, you can use

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:05.776
this gradient to essentially hill climb
up your similarity function, right?

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:09.749
So you can, by computing this, you
don't have to sort of blindly search,

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:13.044
you actually follow that gradient and
get to a local maximum.

00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:14.494
All right?

00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:17.945
And that was the basis
of mean shift tracking.

00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:22.892
So now, going back to our, our previous
example here of the ping pong, right,

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.495
we start with the, the current frame.

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:26.575
We want to search, but

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:31.035
now our search can actually climb
to the maximum of this function,

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:34.467
using that gradient information,
and that's mean shift tracking.
