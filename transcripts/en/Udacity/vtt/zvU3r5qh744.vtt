00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.650
Once a registration authority
has verified identity,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.770
certificates can be issued.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.770
That's the job of
the certificate authority.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.860
They issue the certificates and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.000
typically encrypt public keys
using their private keys.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.810
Can you think about what that does?

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.570
Hint, we just discussed
a similar concept under trust.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.400
Why does the certificate
authority encrypt

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670
public keys with their private keys?
