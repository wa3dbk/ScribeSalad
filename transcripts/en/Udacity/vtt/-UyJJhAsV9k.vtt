00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.750
So in this lesson, I brought together concepts of focal length, field of view,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.400
and sensor size.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.240
I discussed the impact focal length has on how an image is formed.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.220
Both on the creative sides a little bit, but also on the technical side.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.220
As to what you can get in terms of field of view and focal length.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.865
Also discussed perspective projection, which allows you to

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:25.790
kind of start looking at objects that are further away or closer.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.950
And how that is impacted with focal lengths.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.340
Lot of basic material, but

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.760
we will continue to advance further and see more details in the next lesson.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.770
For example, we look at exposure triangle.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.400
We, we'll actually look at aperture,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.220
shutter speed and also more information about the sensor size or sensor values.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.670
That has, perhaps gives us more control on what the photography process is

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.520
all about.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.210
Of course, we're looking at this because we want to try to understand how

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.700
we're going to bring them towards computation.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.190
Again, I've listed a couple of books for you to look at if you're interested.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.190
I do use a lot of resources on the web, please look at, look them up.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.720
More will be available on the website.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.700
And again, thanks to Professor Christensen who provided us with some

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.150
amazing images of the Tech Tower and Georgia Tech campus.
