We know by now that functions and
closures are the same thing.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.700
But there's one last
thing we need to know.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.110
It's very easy to understand and
even seems very natural.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.600
But not all languages have this feature.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.350
When you add it to the first type
nature of Swift functions and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.050
closures, it turns into
super powerful tools.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.790
But before we get started, make sure to
also download the Rich Playground for

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.660
this lesson.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.530
You have the link in
the instructor notes.
