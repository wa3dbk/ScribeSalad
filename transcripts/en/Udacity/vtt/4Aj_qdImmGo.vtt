00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.996
There are 19 people aged zero to 19, which is about here. And there are 21

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:12.368
people aged 20 to 39, which is about here. And then, five people between 40 and

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.740
59, and five people between 60 and 79. That means our bar graph will look like

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:23.917
this. So, we have the axis. Frequency is always on the y-axis. And then, the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.153
variable is on the x-axis. In this case, it's age. If you recall, sometimes the

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:34.411
independent variable is also called the predictor variable. And the dependent

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:39.474
variable, which is on the y-axis, is also called the outcome. But not in this

00:00:39.486 --> 00:00:45.447
case. This is a special type of graph called a histogram, and the variable on

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:51.448
the y-axis is just a frequency. Here, at the intersection of the axes is the

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.672
origin. It's Cartesian coordinates are 0,0 because from here, we've gone zero to

00:00:57.684 --> 00:01:03.650
the right and zero up. Each axis goes from low to high. So, we start at zero and

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:09.820
work our way up to higher values. Same with here on the y-axis. So now we have a

00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:13.735
histogram for our sample of 50 Udacity students.
