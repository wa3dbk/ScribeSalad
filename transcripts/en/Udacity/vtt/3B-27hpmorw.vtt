To find the set of C Union E, you want any elements that are in set C or in set

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:09.710
E. So, I list the numbers, usually in order, with curly braces on the ends and

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:14.713
with commas in between. For the 2, 4, and 6, I don't need to list them twice. I

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:19.422
know that they're in set C and in set E, but I only need to list them once in

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:20.056
the Union.
