00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.665
Okay. We're going to talk a little bit more about correlation measures. We've

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:06.520
already mentioned r squared. Remember, r squared gives us the strength of the

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.194
relationship between two variables. Sometimes r squared is called the

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:15.334
coefficient of determination. Because r squared is a proportion, it ranges from

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:19.216
0 to 1. And our r squared value of 0 means that the variables are not at all

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:25.230
related. And our r squared of 1 means they are perfectly related. This rarely

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.067
ever happens in everyday life. It's hard to imagine variables that are

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:33.315
perfectly related. When conducting the t test, the formula for r squared can be

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:38.246
derived from the information from our t test. The formula for our r squared is

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:43.474
t squared over t squared plus our degrees of freedom. The t here is not the

00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:49.208
critical value, it's the value we get from the t test itself. In computing r

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:53.240
squared, all we have to do is compute our t value from the formula, square it,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.400
put that in the numerator, square it again, add our degrees of freedom and then

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.050
divide.
