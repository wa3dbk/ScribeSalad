00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.319
Well, as we expected from our picture and from our work earlier on in the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.148
lesson, we got complex numbers as our roots. Now, looking at where the vertex of

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:13.621
our parabola is below the x-axis, and the fact that the parabola is pointing

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:18.593
downward, this curve doesn't really fit the situation that we're interested in.

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:22.799
Remember, that y here in this equation and in this graph, is the vertical

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.419
displacement from the ground of the water and x is the horizontal displacement

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.502
of the water. Right now, the water is underground and that's not really what

00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:35.654
Grant's looking for in terms of decorations. So, what do you think is wrong with

00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:39.776
Grant's equation and his graph right now? There's one single thing that we can

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:43.770
do to this graph that would fix the entire problem that we're having. The

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.192
mislocation of the horizontal and veritcal coordinates of the water in Grant's

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:52.128
fountain. So, what one step should we do to this graph to make it better

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:56.810
describe that fountain's shape? Should we flip this parabola upside down? Should

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.876
we translate it up? Translate it down? Make it wider? Make it skinnier?

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:05.054
Translate it to the right? Translate it to the left? Or just leave it alone

00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:05.809
altogether?
