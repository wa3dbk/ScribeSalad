00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.580
Now let's take a look at one of the hardest

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.490
things to deal with, with working with the app cache. The

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.370
fact that you have to remember to update the application

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.060
cache. Let's say, we change something in our file, let's add

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.050
a title. Now, let's save this and go back and

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.990
try to reload again. Now, you'll notice that even though I

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.460
saved the index.html file Nothing happened to the cashe. It's

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.290
because the only thing that was checked was the cashe file,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.370
the manifest, and we didn't touch the manifest at all. So let's go back and do

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.720
that now. So in the manifest, we need to do some actual change to the file. We

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.410
can't just touch it with the command line

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.690
utility touch. That actually won't trigger a reload.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.260
So let's just add a version number hit

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.190
save and now let's go back and reload again.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.040
This time you'll see again we've downloaded the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.430
cache. But remember what we are seeing here, what

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.900
the user is seeing here is not actually the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.760
new content. It loaded it from the cache. And

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.260
then updated the cache, not in real time, that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.580
way the user gets the content immediately, while they

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.330
still get updated content. Now we can listen for

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.400
the event on cache updated, and the cache update

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940
event will tell us that the user really needs to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.030
pick a good time to reload. We could surface that by

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.260
popping a dialog box that says, Hey, this application is

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.610
updated. Do you want to reload now? But, that can also be

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.290
postponed, and you can just presume that the user will

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.320
get a new version, when they hit refresh again. If I

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.140
hit refresh one more time, now it's pulling it from

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.740
the cache again, and I have the updated content over here.
