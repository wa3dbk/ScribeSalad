To find the compliment of 30 degrees, we took 90 degrees and subtracted that

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:09.334
angle. So, we got 60. We can use the same reasoning to find the compliment angle

00:00:09.346 --> 00:00:13.871
of this unknown angle. We know that angles add up to 90 degrees, so we start

00:00:13.883 --> 00:00:18.609
with 90 degrees, then we subtract off angle x. We know we start with 90 degrees,

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:23.121
a right angle, and then we just subtract off angle x. This will leave us with

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.695
just the compliment angle.
