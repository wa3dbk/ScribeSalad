This equation that we just developed is a great start. But one thing that Grant

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:08.503
learned from a businessman at the expo, is that the price of an item actually

00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:12.597
effects the number of it that you can sell. So, in this case that would mean

00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:16.806
that n actually depends on c. If we let the horizontal axis here represent the

00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:20.966
price of an item, or c, and the vertical axis, represent the number of the item

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:25.127
we sell, n. Which of these graphs best represents the relationship between c and

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:29.054
n? Think about what each of them says about how change in the price will affect

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:32.924
the number of units sold. This is a pretty simplistic view of economics, but

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:36.255
just think about which of these is the best choice out of the four.
