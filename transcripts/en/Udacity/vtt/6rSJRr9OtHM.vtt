00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.570
So, let's talk a little bit about our procedure here. The first thing

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.750
we want to do is build a list of all carrier values. We could do

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.690
that by hand, might actually be a little easier to do it that way

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.760
just by looking at the HTML. We then need to build a list of

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.820
airport values. Now there are a lot of values here. So what we

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.880
probably want to do is actually write a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.630
little script that will actually pull those

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.860
out. Okay. So all pages are going to have exactly the same list for

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.250
both of these. So we can just use the browser to download an example

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.520
page and pull those values out. Next, what we need to do

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.270
is make HTTP requests to download all the data. I'll talk about

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.460
why we want to download it all in just a minute. Then what

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.415
we want to to is parse the data files. The reason why we

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:41.822
want to do it this way, is because, in building our parser we

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:45.080
want to make sure we're working with data that isn't going to change.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.230
And after the fact, once we do a little bit of data

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.260
cleaning, we may discover that the reason why we've got some dirty

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.960
data is actually because we have a bug in our parser. Much easier

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.570
to figure out where that bug is if we've still got the original data

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.160
we were using to parse. I should also point out that it really

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.540
doesn't make sense to download the data over and over again as we're figuring

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.910
out how to parse it. Something else you might want to keep in

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.890
mind is that for years prior to the current year the data isn't going

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.410
to change, so there's no reason to retrieve it more than once. So this

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.370
is actually a bit of a best practice. When you've got a situation like

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.700
the one we have here and when you've got a scraping

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.800
task it's often going to look something like this. You really want

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.720
to grab all the data you need first and then do your

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.580
scraping into separate process. So what we have for this particular problem

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.830
is essentially three different steps. We first have to build all the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.680
values we're going to use to make HTTP request. We then need

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.570
to make all the HTTP request, and download the data we need.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.750
And then finally, we're going to parse the data we want out

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.400
of those data files, shaping it into the particular pieces

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.660
of data, the particular items that we want to use.
