00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.140
So a new context always gets created in the same context as its

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.030
function was defined within.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.039
In this case, that was the red context.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.750
Moving along with our program, we see that we can add a deed variable to

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.149
the local context and then we run a log on all three variables.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.370
In this case, what would you expect the output to be?
