00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.157
Here are the two original equations and let's try graphing them. The first

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:08.539
equation is already in slope-intercept form, so I won't do anything with it. For

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:13.037
the second equation, I'll change it into slope-intercept form. First, I subtract

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:17.199
4 x from both sides, then I divide each term by negative 2. This is where want

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.687
to be careful. I get positive 1y here, positive 2x here. And negative 3 for my

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:25.855
constant. The y intercept is negative 2 for the purple graph and the slope is

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:30.070
positive 2 over 1. For the green graph, the y intercept is negative 3 and our

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.146
slope is 2. Notice that the slopes are the same, so we have parallel lines.

00:00:34.146 --> 00:00:38.434
Parallel lines will never intersect. So, we know that there can't be a solution

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:42.691
here. Whenever we solve an equation and get a statement like 4 equals 6, we know

00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:47.955
there can't be a solution. The lines must parallel, just like in this case.
