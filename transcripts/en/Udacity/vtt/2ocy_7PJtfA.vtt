00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.010
So before I start today's class I'd like to take you on a trip that I recently

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.110
did to share some of the things that excite me in my life with all of you.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.680
I actually went to Washington, D.C. and the highlight of the day for

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.930
me was to visit the National Museum of American History.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.090
Some of you might know this.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.378
In 1998 a team led by Wolfram Burgard and

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:28.140
myself put a robotic tour guide into this museum.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.920
This robot was in the museum for about two weeks and it led kids and

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.610
visitors of the museum through the exhibit.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.900
It did localization similar to what I taught you before.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.470
It used a learned map of the environment.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.000
We programmed by hand the specific location of exhibits and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490
was also able to say something.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.190
It was also able to smile and to frown.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.080
And as you can see in this video, sometimes even kids climbed onto it.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.490
But today I'm here to see Stanley.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.860
Stanley has been here for a couple of years now in exhibits our robot that won

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.230
the DARPA Grand Challenge, and it was really fascinating to see the thing

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.910
that we've built and visited in its own little room in the Smithsonian museum.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.590
This exhibit has been made specifically to celebrate Stanley's victory.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.580
And in exploring this exhibit again I found that the curators had

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.550
actually put some program code on the wall for people to understand.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.540
Let's zoom in.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.100
You can see Kalman.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.760
So, at the time you are already working with Kalman filters and

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.530
in our parameter file, as shown here, the word Kalman occurs many times.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.660
So, what I've been teaching you last class about the Kalman filter really had

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.500
a major role to play in making Stanley the robot win the DARPA Grand Challenge.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.290
So these are deep emotional moments for me going back to the past and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.990
seeing what we've done and how it's been preserved.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.630
But I want to share with everybody here because it’s part of my life and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.320
it’s part of what we’ve done in building self-driving cars, and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.230
the methods I’m teaching you in this class are essentially the same methods as

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.880
we used back in Stanley and in Junior when we did the Urban Challenge.
