00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.280
Country was encoded by color hue.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.280
Game win or losses was encoded by position y or orientation.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.060
Scoring margin was encoded by position Y or length.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.910
World Cup winners were indicated by shape, and time was encoded by position X.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.560
Let's see these on the graphic.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.050
We can see the country is encoded by the color of the bars, or

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.630
really each country has its own panel of data.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.380
So, Germany would be red, Brazil would be green, Argentina blue and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.380
The Netherlands orange.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.020
Each of these bars represents an individual game and

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.680
the scoring margin for that game.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.590
So, whether or not a game was a win or

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.010
loss depends on the Y position, or the orientation of the bar.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.120
Bars that point upwards indicate wins for

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.970
Germany, while bars that point downward indicate losses for Germany.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.780
The actual scoring margin for each game is the length of the bar.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.940
In this case it looks like about positive 3.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.880
We also accepted position Y since the scoring margin could be positive upward,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.150
or downward negative.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.860
Time is encoded horizontally along the x-axis for each of our small multiples.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.295
And then finally, whether or not a country was a World Cup winner is encoded

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:13.265
by shape or a star, which we see for Germany in 1954, 1974 and 1990.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.350
Now I think this visualization is quite successful.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.360
And what's incredible is that there's even more going on in it,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.330
such as the annotations that you see here, and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.440
the alternation between this white and light tan background encoding the years.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.320
If you find other things that you like about this visualization,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.710
share it on the discussion threads.
