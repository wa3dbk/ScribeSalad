00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.705
The answer is, Simulation is coupled with Manager and Manager is coupled with

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:10.813
Portfolio. You can see this because Simulation points at Manager in the diagram

00:00:10.813 --> 00:00:17.128
and Manager points at Portfolio. But Portfolio doesn't point at Simulation, or

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:23.980
back at the Manager. Similarly Assignment doesn't have an arrow to Portfolio.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.461
So Assignment isn't coupled with Portfolio. And remember in the code, this

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:35.460
dotted arrow means that Simulation uses Manager. So somewhere in Simulation, a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.550
Manager object or a Manager method is used.
