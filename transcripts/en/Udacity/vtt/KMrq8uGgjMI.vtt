00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.002
Let's talk about one of the new terms that we just saw in the last quiz, a

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:08.425
relative minimum. Now if we have some function, f of x, we can call a value of

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:13.111
that function, at a certain point, a relative minimum, if it is related to other

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.916
points on the function how. Does it need to be lower than them or higher than

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:21.386
them? And does being a relative minimum refer to the value of the function at

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:26.138
that point, in relation to the entire range of the function, or just in relation

00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:29.751
to other values of the function near the relative minimum?
