00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.660
Okay.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.640
So now let's tackle
objective three together.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.600
This objective really has three parts.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.310
First we need to create a link
to make a new restaurant.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.860
Then create a page to handle the get
request when we click on that link.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.830
And finally, a get post method to
persist the data to the database.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.210
Well the first part
doesn't seem too hard.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.500
Let's add another anchor tag to our
restaurants page that prompts the user

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.330
to create a new restaurant,
followed by a few break lines.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.080
We can go ahead and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.900
fill out this href to /restaurants/new
as stated in the objective.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.340
Next, I will create another page to
handle this new restaurant request.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.950
Inside my do_GET block, I will add
another if statement that looks for

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.820
the /restaurants/new URL.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.980
Looking at this code,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.660
we can see a lot of similarities with
our previous do_GET if statements.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.580
I have added here a field where the user
can input the name of a new restaurant.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.980
So now that the layout is in place,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.580
the magic really happens
with our post request.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.490
Unlike get requests,
post requests cannot be executed by

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.250
simply typing a URL in the browser and
hitting enter.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.840
However, do_POST is going to look for
the /restaurants /newpath,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.586
passed along from my forum,
in order to know what action to perform.

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:06.470
Inside my do_POST,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.890
I will comment out the previous
code inside the try block for now.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.860
I then add an if statement,
looking for /restaurants/new.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.290
Then I extract the information from
the form similarly to the way I

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.370
did it in the first web server we wrote.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.340
But this time I incorporate that
data into my declaration of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.760
a new restaurant class.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.950
Also differently now,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.130
instead of printing my results to
the current webpage, I create a redirect

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.460
here that will take me back to my
original restaurant's homepage.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.610
Let's save and restart our server again.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.340
If we can create a new restaurant, and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.650
see it added to our page,
objective three is over and out.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.580
The source code for objective three
is available in the instructor notes.
