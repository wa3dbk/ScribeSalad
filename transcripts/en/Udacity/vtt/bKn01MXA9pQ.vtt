Let's look at the approximation quality of these algorithms,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.710
and we're going to start with the "Take 2" algorithm.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.540
Here is the little graph for which we are going to try and example.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.330
As a first practice quiz, how large is a minimum vertex cover for this small graph here?

00:00:14.330 --> 99:59:59.000
