00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.719
After we have designed our system we can implement

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.900
it. In the implementation phase what we do is basically

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.410
taking care of realizing the design of the system

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.920
that we just created and create an actual software system.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.530
There are four fundamental principles, four pillars that can

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.470
affect the way in which software is constructed. The first

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.900
one is the reduction of complexity. This aims to build

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.160
software that is easier to understand and use. The second

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.400
pillar is the anticipation of diversity. Which takes into

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.720
account that software construction might change in various way over

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.220
time. That is that software evolves. In many cases,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.270
it evolves in unexpected ways. And therefore, we have to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.680
be able to anticipate some of these changes. The

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.390
third pillar is the structuring for validation. Also called design

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.550
for testability. And what this means is that we

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.760
want to build software so that it is easily testable

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.890
during the subsequent validation and verification activities. Finally, and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.040
this is especially true within specific organizations and or

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.770
domains. It is important that the software conforms to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.330
a set of internal or external standards. And some examples

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.730
of this might be, for example, for internal standards,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.680
coding standards within an organization, or naming standards within an

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.320
organization. As for external standards, if for example you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.780
are developing some medical software. There are some regulations and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.930
some standards that you have to adhere to in

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.060
order for your software to be valid in that domain.
