I'd already given you instructions for how to type these two right here, the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.275
square root of 2 and the cubed root of x. But then, as you can see for these two

00:00:07.287 --> 00:00:10.939
slightly more difficult ones, when you write out all the keys you have to type

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:14.679
in MathQuill, it looks super complicated. But hopefully, if you found it's a

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:18.735
little more intuitive when you're actually typing it, especially because you've

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:22.596
already had practice using MathQuill before. Please remember that when you type

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:26.405
parentheses in MathQuill, it actually fills in the second parentheses when you

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:29.147
type the first one, so you don't have to retype at the end.
