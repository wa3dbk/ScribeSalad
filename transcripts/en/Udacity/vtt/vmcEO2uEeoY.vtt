00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Again, that should not have been too hard. The answer is, of course, a bug in the compiler.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We can check all of these possible causes by the changes they have.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
No me would have some effect--well, you wouldn't be able to listen to this course right now.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Richard Stallman--no Richard Stallman would have a huge impact.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The GNU project is the source for so much great open source software out there.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We would have a very different role. Oxygen is of more important.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I can't even start to begin to imagine how our world would look like, and of all these courses,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
fixing a bug in the compiler has by far the smallest set of assumption and also the smallest effect

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because apart from fixing the bug and apart from fixing the crash, nothing else changes

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and therefore, this is the actual cause.
