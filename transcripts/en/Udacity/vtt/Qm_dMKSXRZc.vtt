Fortunately, for us, again, Grant tells us more information. He tells us that

00:00:04.806 --> 00:00:09.146
he's going to make 120 nozzles per day for the next month. Taking this

00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:13.971
information into account, can you figure out a value for x based on this data?

00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:18.627
Remember, that x stands for the total number of nozzles made and I'd like to

00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:20.938
know what x will equal after 1 month.
