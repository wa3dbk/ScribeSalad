00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.880
Now we'll finally return to our bacteria example which you remember was about

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.295
how many bacteria will still be alive after a time t since a drug was

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:14.540
administrated. In order to solve an equation we can only have one variable but

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.550
right now we have two. B and t. We want the number of bacteria to be 5. So, if

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.250
we set the number of bacteria equal to 5, what does this equation become?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.730
Remember, that means we need to substitute in 5, in place of the variable that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.529
represents the number of bacteria.
