00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.840
So, in the next theory of personality, we have the humanistic approach. And the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.860
fundamental assumption of the humanistic approach personality is that people

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.084
are striving to be the best person they can be. That is, self-actualizing, so

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:17.110
you may recall from lesson 11, when we talked about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.750
of needs. And at the peak of that need hierarchy was self-actualization. And

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.779
it's just that, when people are striving to be the best person they can be. Now

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.937
self-actualizing people are very rare, doesn't happen very often, but they do

00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:37.294
seem to have some qualities, a lot of qualities actually. Some of them are for

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:42.390
instance, they tend to have a purpose and calling in their work. They tend to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.774
be very simple and natural in their interactions. And in their work, they also

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:52.200
tend to be creative and fulfilled. Now self-actualization only happens however,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.191
once the lower level needs are met. So first the physiological, then the

00:00:57.191 --> 00:01:01.095
safety, and the belongingness needs have to be met before someone can attain

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:03.454
self-actualization.
