00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.370
The answer here is that there are 512 possibilities to get from A to B,

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.530
and the way to figure this out is to notice that there's a general rule here.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.740
Each time that we add two vertices, the number of different ways

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.110
that you can use to get from A to B doubles.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.230
We add 2 here, the number of ways to get from A to B multiplies by 2.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.140
We add 2 here and the number multiplies by 2 and so on and so on.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.360
To get from 10 to 20, we have to add two vertices 5 times, so we already know that

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.520
there are 16 ways to get from A to B if we have 10 vertices.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.270
For 20 vertices, we add 2 five times, which means we multiply

00:00:48.270 --> 99:59:59.000
by 2 five times and that turns out to be 512.
