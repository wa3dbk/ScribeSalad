00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.348
The cocktail party effect is another example of selective attention. Now

00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:07.384
imagine you're in a room having a conversation with your friends about how much

00:00:07.384 --> 00:00:11.453
you love your Introduction to Psychology at Udasity class. And how everybody

00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:16.110
should take it. Then all of a sudden you heard your name from across the room.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.882
In this example you're selectively attending to the conversation you were

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:22.926
having. Yet still heard your name across a noisy room with a bunch of other

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:27.670
conversations going on. So you were able to filter out the background auditory

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.218
stimuli that wasn't important, that was the background conversations. Yet you

00:00:33.218 --> 00:00:37.084
were still able to focus on the important stimulus which was your name. So that

00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:39.690
background information came to the foreground.
