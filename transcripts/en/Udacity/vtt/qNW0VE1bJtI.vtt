Remember, in math, we want to be able to work forwards and then we also want to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.106
work backwards. Sometimes it's helpful to convert back to a percent. To get back

00:00:09.118 --> 00:00:13.613
to a percentage, I would undo the percent. I know percent means divide by 100

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:18.017
and I want to undo this. So to undo dividing by 100, I have to multiply by 100.

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:22.919
If I multiply by 100, I move the decimal place two places to the right. This

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:27.909
should make sense, because we can remember that multiplying by 100 is the same

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:32.402
as multiplying by 10 squared. I'm going to move my decimal two places to the

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:37.939
right, because the exponent is positive. So, I'll get 23%. 600ths would turn

00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:44.602
back into 6% and 2 would turn into 200%.
