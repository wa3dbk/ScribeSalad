00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.440
So the first question we need to answer for any problem is what are the inputs?

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.334
For this problem their fairly clearly stated says, given your birthday and the

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:10.502
current date. Well, that's the input to the problem. What's the set of inputs we

00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:13.685
really want this to work for? Should it really just work for my birthday and

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.305
today's current date? If that's all we wanted it to work for then we can figure

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.508
this out once. We don't actually have to write a procedure. So I think what is

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:24.729
intended by this is something much more general. So the inputs are really two

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:27.803
dates, and that gives us the type of the input, that gives us a set of all

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:31.180
possible inputs. We need to think a little more carefully to know if they're all

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.283
valid. Well, the statement of the question give us a good clue here. It said,

00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:38.561
assume that the birthday and the current data are correct dates and no time

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:41.988
travel. This probably is a valid assumption if we're talking about birthdays and

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:46.499
current dates. If we're comparing any two dates, well this says that the second

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.152
date needs to be after the first one. Assumptions like this make life easier for

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:55.660
programmers. That means it's easier to write our code since it has to work for

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.768
fewer possible inputs. I like the way Mattias stated this is no time travel. For

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:04.058
a program specification, we probably want to be a little more precise, and just

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:08.200
state simply the second date must not be before the first date. And if we're

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.244
being good defensive programmers, we should check if this is true. It's an

00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:16.458
assumption, it's up to the user of our code to satisfy this, because we've said,

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:20.610
well that's a requirement. To use our solution you have to make sure the second

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.020
date is not before the first date. But if we're going to be smart we're going to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.485
program in a more defensive way, because sometimes other people might make

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:30.944
mistakes or we might make mistakes. And we're actually going to check this in

00:01:30.944 --> 00:01:34.835
our code. The other assumption we might want is something about the range of

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:39.105
dates. Calendars are very complicated and they've changed over history. We're

00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:44.110
going to require that the dates are valid dates in the Gregorian calendar, which

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.142
started in October 1582. Our code will probably work for dates outside this

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:51.726
range, but it might not get exactly the right answer, since when the calendar

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:53.553
changed, the meaning of dates changed.
