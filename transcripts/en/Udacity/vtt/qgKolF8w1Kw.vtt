00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Another question on the forums asked about the the length of writing down a bunch of

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
regular expression rules, or tokens, for a language.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The basic question was something like, this seems to go on forever!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I can imagine having to write down so many token definition rules

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that I would expire of boredom before we ever finished.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Is that what happens in the real world? What's it like?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My answer to this is to some degree, there's no silver bullet.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There's no single easy way to encode structured information

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to bring order from chaos.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But what I can tell you is that it is a totally surmountable task for real world languages.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I've been associated with a lexer and a parser, a frontend for the C-programming language.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
To handle this C-programming language, which has a lot of gory details,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
our list of token definitions was 600 lines long.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That might seem like a lot if you're writing it out all at once,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but in the grand scheme of things, a normal program like the Firefox web browser

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is multiple millions of lines long.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So this list of regular expressions, this list of token definitions,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is actually a very miniscule part of the entire software engineering effort.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I was also involved in the creation of a lexer and parser, an interpreter for Java--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Java 1.1 at the time, and our list of tokens, our token definition file was 200 lines long.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Java was more regular than C in that regard, didn't require the lexer act,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which you can ask me about at some later point.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
200 lines is even more reasonable.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Finally, I think in one of the videos at some point, I mentioned in a particular Tetris game

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that I had the pleasure of working on, and there was a piece definition language

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that let me use the planner pentominoes instead of the normal 4-length tetris pieces.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There the piece definition reader was more like 90 lines long,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
which is seeming even smaller and more attractible.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But the way you really want to think about this is more like, say reasoning by analogy.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Is it a lot of work to build a road? Is it a lot of work to build a sewer system?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Is it a lot of work to paint a beautiful picture?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Yes, but you do the work once, and then you advertise the cost for everyone

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
who gets the chance to enjoy that construction.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Yes, it takes a long time to pave a road, but after that, many people can drive over it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Often, language definitions like C or Java or C# or JavaScript--

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
they don't change very quickly, if they change at all.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Once you have taken the time to write down all of your token definitions for JavaScript,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
even if it is a few hundred lines long,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
you look at it. You write some test cases. You feel good about it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You do a code walk through with someone else, and then you're done,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and you can just build upon that, take advantage of it for the rest of your

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
software development career.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So it can be a bit arduous to write down a bunch of token definitions,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
especially since a lot of them seem the same.

00:02:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
But you do it once, and then it's over.
