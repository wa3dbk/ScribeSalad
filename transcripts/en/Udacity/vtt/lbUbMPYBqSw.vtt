00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.930
The answer is that the two objects we passed in, green and

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.030
blue, are going to be logged in our output.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.500
These variables referred to those two objects?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.080
For a moment, they were given the names one and two.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.110
The green object, stored as green in the global scope,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.730
was given the name one inside this function scope for that one invocation.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.740
And the blue one was given the name two.
