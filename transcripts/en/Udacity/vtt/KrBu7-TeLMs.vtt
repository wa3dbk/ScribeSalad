00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.061
For this equation, x would equal 3 halves. Great thinking if you found this

00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:10.997
fraction. Now we want to start by rewriting these with the same base. So I know

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:16.970
9 is 3 squared. And I know 27 is 3 cubed. We have a power raised to a power, so

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.757
I'll multiply these two exponents to get 3 to the 2 x equal to 3 cubed. Now

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:27.889
that our bases are identical, then we can set these exponents equal. So we'll

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:33.760
have 2x equal to 3. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we'll have x is

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.600
equal to 3 halves, or 1 and a half.
