00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.560
We just saw that log base 10 of 5 times 5 is equal to 2 log base 10 of 5. And

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.570
log base 10 of 5 times 5 times 5 is equal to 3 log base 10 of 5. However,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.710
there's a way we could rewrite the inputs to these two logs. This first one is

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.420
just equal to log base 10 of 5 squared. And this one is equal to log base 10 of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.430
5 to the 3rd, or 5 cubed. So what if instead we had log base 10 of 5 to the n.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.668
How could you rewrite this without using any exponents?
