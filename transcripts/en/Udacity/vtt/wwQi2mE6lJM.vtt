00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.530
Here's another challenge.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.910
The layout that you see here
was created with Flexbox.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.530
For all of the elements of different
colors that you see on the screen,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.070
type in the width and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.780
the order of the element that would
be needed to create this layout.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.160
I'll give you the first one.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.040
The light green box and

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.350
the top covers the entire span of
the viewport, so its width is 100%.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.210
And this would be common for

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.250
something like a navbar, and
it comes first on the page.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.640
So I'll set its order to 0.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.770
Now you go ahead and fill out the rest
