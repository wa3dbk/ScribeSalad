00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.676
What if we wee painting all of the spaces in a checkerboard, and we were

00:00:02.676 --> 00:00:07.242
painting them blue and red? When we're drawing this rectangle we need to figure

00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:12.730
out whether it's going to blue or red based on the number of its indexes. We

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.305
want to write a method that takes the row and the column of a space, and then

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:23.346
gives us a one. If the space should be red and a zero if the space should be

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:29.003
blue. The public interface of this method might look like this. So, we need

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.594
some mathematical expression which takes a row and a column and gives back a

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:39.280
one or a zero. If the row and the column are both even or both odd, you should

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.504
get back a zero. If the row is odd but the column is even, then you should get

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:49.572
back a one for red. And if the row is even but the column is odd, you should

00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:53.686
also give back a one. In the checkerboard project that we provided for you in

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:57.158
blue jay, you'll want to implement checkerboard painter, and write a test

00:00:57.158 --> 00:01:02.260
method in checkerboard painter tester. Try running the main method of painted

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.702
checkerboard. Once you've finished, if you need a hint, think about what

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:10.210
happens if you add an even number to an odd number. Do you get an even number

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.769
or an odd number?
