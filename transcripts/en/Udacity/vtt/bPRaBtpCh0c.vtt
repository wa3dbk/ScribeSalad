00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.150
While Gradle provides a great model for

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.570
projects, allowing you to define
tasks and dependencies between them,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.590
by default an empty build script
doesn't do much, or anything really.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.240
This is on by design.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.440
Gradle doesn't want to enforce any
opinions on how your build should work.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.370
In fact, your Gradle build doesn't
necessarily have to build anything.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.800
Fundamentally, Gradle
is an automation tool.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.480
So, whether it's an Android project,
Java project, C/C++ project, or

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.910
database migration build, Gradle is
there to make cumbersome tasks easy.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.880
However, in many cases our projects
will follow some conventions.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.250
And those conventions carry over
into how we build our project.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.190
We want to provide some way to
tell Gradle, what kind of project

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.960
we're building, and what capabilities
we want as part of our build.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.680
Just like a big software project
is easy to understand when it's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.900
broken up into highly
cohesive libraries,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.320
it also makes sense to factor out
build logic into reusable components.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.990
With Gradle we do this
through the use of plugins.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.110
A good plugin extends the Gradle
model to encompass some new domain.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.370
Providing new tasks,
new DSL elements to configure, and

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.510
sensible default behaviors.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.070
A plugin can do anything that can be
done in a Gradle build script itself.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.130
They can define tasks,
configure repositories, or

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.400
even apply other plugins.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.950
Plugins can even extend the Gradle DSL,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.860
allowing users to model
a specific domain.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.210
Later on in this course,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.530
we'll learn how the Google Android
team has done exactly this, to allow

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.450
developers to describe their Android
projects in Gradle build scripts.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.390
Next, let's learn where we can find
out more about the hundreds of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.280
Gradle plugins that
are freely available.
