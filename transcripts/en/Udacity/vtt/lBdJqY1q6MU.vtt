00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's look at these calls and try to figure out what the dependencies are among them.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
First and most obviously, nothing is going to succeed,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
no file system call is going to succeed, until we've mounted the file system.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Similarly, no file system call will succeed after we've unmounted it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we want to be careful with mount and unmount.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We don't want to just freely mix those into our stream of random API calls that we're making

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because if we do that, we're going to be mounting and unmounting the thing so often

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that the file system code is never going to get into the kind of steady state

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that we're going to need it to be in in order to do effective random testing of it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So similarly, some of the other calls in a file system, like reading and writing to a file,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
are only going to succeed if the file has been opened.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And so if we do something silly like providing completely random arguments

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to open read and write, then the odds of us actually successfully reading or writing

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to an open file are going to be extremely low.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So we're going to have to do something more systematic.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We're probably going to have to do something like open a file

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and keep track of the fact that it's open

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so we can randomly generate read and write calls into it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There are probably some other dependencies as well.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So what we're seeing is that if we want to do effective random testing of a file system,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we're going to need to track these dependencies,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
at least in some rudimentary fashion, in order to issue a sequence of API calls

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that's going to do reasonably effective random testing of a file system.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The second issue that starts to come up as we perform random testing of APIs

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is that our tests--that is to say, a sequence of file system operations in this example--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
are going to become quite large, and that's going to beg the question,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
how are those tests represented?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In the examples we've seen so far,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
test cases haven't had any sort of official existence of their own.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What we've rather done is mix the software under test

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and the test driver code in a single piece of Python code.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So now if we do this, what's the actual form taken by the test cases?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And the answer has to be that those test cases only exist as ephemeral objects in memory.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
For most testing purposes, that's fine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The driver code creates the test cases, passes them to the software under test,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
looks at the results, and keeps going until it finishes.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There are a couple cases in which that's not so good.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
One of them is where we find a particular test case that makes our system fail

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and we'd like to save off that test case for later use in regression testing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And so what we end up having to do to make that work is writing some separate code

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which also lives in the Python program to load and save test cases.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And so now this module is going to be doing file AO in order to load and save test cases,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and most likely those test cases are going to be saved as text files or something.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So for example, if we wanted to represent a sequence of file system calls as a text file,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we could just have the word mkdir followed by whatever the arguments to mkdir are,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and then the loading and saving code would need to either parse those files

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in order to create a test case in memory or unparse them--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that is to say, pretty print them to disk in order to save a test case.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And so there's a couple advantages of doing this.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
First of all, as I was saying, it facilitates regression testing.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And the second reason is that it's often the case

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that when random tests become extremely large,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we need to turn them into first class objects--that is to say, objects living on disk

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
using some sort of a save and load routine--in order to perform test case reduction.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Test case reduction is a piece of technology that's very often combined with random testing,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and what it is and what it does is takes a large test case

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that makes the software under test fail and turns it into a smaller test case

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that still makes the software under test fail.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We'll look at more detail and we'll look at test case reduction in more detail

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
later on in this course. Now what I'd like to do...
