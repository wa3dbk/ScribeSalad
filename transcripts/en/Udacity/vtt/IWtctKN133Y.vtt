00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.910
For this graph, the point x equals 1 belongs with the 2x minus 1 part of the

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.471
function, since its domain is x is greater than or equal to 1. Over on the

00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:13.631
right, we should have this end point and this end point filled in. Since we

00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:18.650
have f of x equals negative 2, for x is less than or equal to negative 3. And,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.689
we have f of x equal 5 minus x, for 4 is less than or equal to x. Note that the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.347
middle piece of the function, 1 half x minus 3, has an inequality that isn't

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:32.398
inclusive for either of the numbers involved. So, that means, it should not

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:36.629
include negative 3 or 4, which we see with these open circles here. Awesome.
