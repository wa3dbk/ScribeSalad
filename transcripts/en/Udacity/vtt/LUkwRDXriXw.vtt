00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The next question is how well does this is actually work

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
for providing our goal of authenticating the server to the client

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in cases where the client does not know this public key value before the protocol.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We note that in this step the server sends the public key to the client,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and that's the key that is used to verify the signature.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here are the possible answers. Think about what we will actually get from this protocol.
