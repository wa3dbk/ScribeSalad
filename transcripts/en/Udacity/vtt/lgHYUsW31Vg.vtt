Let's put the idea of complement and supplement to use. We want to find the

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:07.270
measure of an angle whose supplement is 10 more degrees than twice its

00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:11.355
complement. This problem can seem kind of confusing. So let's start with what we

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:14.995
don't know. We know we need to find the measure of an angle. So that's my

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:19.598
unknown, I'm going to call that x. The second part that I've underlined in blue

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.247
represents an equation. The supplement is, or equals, 10 more than twice it's

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.654
complement. So notice how I've taken the words and translated them into an

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:33.214
equation. Let's put the ideas of complement and supplement to use. We know the

00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:37.824
complement for any angle is 90 minus x. And the supplement for any angle, is 180

00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:43.997
minus x. So, what equation can you write using only x to replace these words?

00:00:44.122 --> 00:00:45.882
Enter your answer here.
