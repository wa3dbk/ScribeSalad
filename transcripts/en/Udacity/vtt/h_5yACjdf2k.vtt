00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.910
Now that you've seen
a bunch of activities for

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.950
the define stage, I want you to practice
breaking down an overall product

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.400
experience into much simpler steps.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.170
Your task is to create a golden path for

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.210
users to successfully
use the shopping app.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.080
Now, keep in mind the golden path
should only have the main or

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.440
the essential steps that a user takes to
find the real value that they came for

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.340
the product in the first place.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.640
Supporting threads,
such as editing orders or

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.060
creating accounts,
are secondary to the golden path.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.010
You can include those, but
they're not really essential for

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.950
the main tasks that the user
would need to perform.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.550
And remember that you should be thinking
in terms of stories rather than pages.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.500
This helps you prioritize the central or
the key user journey.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.290
So go ahead and create a Golden Path for
the Super Duper Shopping App.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.650
Keep in mind the previous personas,
the first tweet, and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.450
the one page executive summary.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.420
You can see the Instructor Notes for
these materials.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.900
