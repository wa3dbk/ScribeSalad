The ultimate value of the clock radio to its user is how it responds to these

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.140
listed events. Each of the events we have listed should have some effect on

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.220
the radio state. Consider what happens when you turn the volume knob.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.900
Certainly you would expect the sound coming from the speaker to be louder. But

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
there is another response. The rotational position of the knob will also have

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.480
changed. This is an important piece of feedback to the user,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.630
who may be adjusting the loudness, in the dark of the night.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.070
We can fill this in, this information into, into a table of responses.
