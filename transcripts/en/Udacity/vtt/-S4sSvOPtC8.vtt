00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.776
Now that you have an idea of what a logarithm is, let's explore their

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:08.433
properties. Since the logarithm of a number is an exponent. Let's actually

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:11.544
review the properties of exponents first, so that way, we can see how they

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:16.500
apply to logarithms. What's the result of each of these operations? You should

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.980
write your answer using x as the base, and then using some combination of a and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.630
b for the exponent.
