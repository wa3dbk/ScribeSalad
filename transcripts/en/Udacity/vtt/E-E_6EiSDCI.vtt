00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.957
The correct answer is blah equals the

00:00:05.957 --> 00:00:11.941
list "one, 2 and now "th\" r\"

00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:18.370
ee"]}. The main distinction between a Python object and a JSON representation of

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.590
a very similar object is that JSON has to use double quotes to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.690
delineate a string. It can't use single quotes like Python does. So, you must

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.280
escape any internal double quotes. Alright, so this is basic JSON.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.310
And as we've seen it maps very nicely to Python data structures,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.941
assuming you're using integers and floats and strings. If you want

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:38.868
to map a more complicated Python structure 2 JSON, let's say you're

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:41.140
doing an object or maybe a date time or some other

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.940
things, the JSON dumps function isn't going to work for you. You're

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.930
going to have to actually convert those by hand to a simple

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.160
data structure made up of dictionaries, and lists, and integers, and strings

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.560
so that we can output it properly.
