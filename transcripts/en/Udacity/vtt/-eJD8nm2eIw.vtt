00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.838
Here's our third problem with motion. This time we have a speed boat that takes

00:00:03.838 --> 00:00:08.677
6 hours to travel downstream when the current is 12 miles per hour. The return

00:00:08.677 --> 00:00:12.583
trip for the boat would be upstream and the boat's going to travel at its same

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:18.070
speed. But against the current and that's going to take it 8 hours. Your

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.458
challenge is to find the speed of the boat in still water. As always, we'll use

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:27.394
a table to help us get started. So again here, we're looking for the speed of

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:31.711
the boat. So we'll let that be x. See if you can fill in the missing

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.446
information for our table. And this time there is something different with our

00:00:35.446 --> 00:00:40.756
time column. We're actually given the times to go upstream and downstream. This

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:46.101
means that we'll have numbers here and expressions for distance here. See if

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:48.051
you can figure this one out.
