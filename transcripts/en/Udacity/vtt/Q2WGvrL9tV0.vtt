00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.750
I know 2 4th is the same thing as one-half because I can see visually that their

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:09.350
areas are the same. 2 3rd is not equal to one-half. I know that I have half of

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:14.525
the circle here that's already shaded. So, this little extra bit would be more

00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:18.625
than one-half. 3 4th is also not equal to one-half. I know that one-half is this

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:23.350
much, and here I already have one-half, and a little bit more. 3 6th is equal to

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:28.194
one-half. I think about moving this one piece here over to the empty space here.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.567
Here's what it would look like. There.

00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:35.818
Now I have 3 6th, it's the same as one-half. 4 10th is not equal to one-half. I

00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:39.879
know I'm missing one extra piece to get to my half, so that won't work.
