00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.330
Moving on to the next line in our code,
we see that running the newSaga () ;

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.560
function should have the effect of
creating a new execution context, so

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.140
that it can make room for new variables
that are local to that function column.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.710
Then, the new context will become the
interpreter's new current context, for

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.590
as long as that function is running.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.100
This first line will add a new
variable to the current scope.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.390
The next line adds another
variable to the red scope,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.550
this time holding a function value.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.340
At this point, we'll have to do
a lookup on the saga variable,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.610
In order to know which function
these parens are attempting to call.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.510
The interpreter handles this by
checking whether the name saga

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.220
has any meaning in its current
context; the red context.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.150
The interpreter checks the scope of
the current execution context, and

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.630
finds that the saga variable is
available locally in that red scope.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.160
The value found there
is a function object.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.040
And the parens next to the word saga,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.290
tell the interpreter to
invoke that function.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.150
Running the saga function will
build a new execution context, and

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.770
move the interpreter's
lookup focus into it.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.810
The first line adds a new
variable to that local scope, and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.790
now we do lookups on all
three of our variables.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.540
Again, the interpreter will do this,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.990
by scanning outward from its
current context, looking for

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.635
the closest containing context
that can satisfy a requested name.

00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:24.365
First it goes looking for hero,

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:28.415
which can't be found in the containing
context, and so it falls through.

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:30.125
Falling through to the red context,

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.425
the interpreter does not find
a hero variable there either.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.155
Finally, falling all the way
through to the global context,

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:38.320
the variable is found there.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.560
The string being logged is
beginning to get built up.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.090
Next, it goes looking for
the deed variable.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.940
What will be the output of that lookup?
