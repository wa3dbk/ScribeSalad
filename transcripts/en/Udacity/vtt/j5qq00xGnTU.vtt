00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's now talk about scheduling and fairness. And then

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.700
we talked about, in a crossbar switch, the process

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.560
of matching input ports to output ports. The decision

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.520
about which ports should be matched in any particular

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.500
time slot is a process called scheduling. There are

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.720
two important goals in scheduling. One is efficiency which

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.880
is to say that if there is traffic at

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.480
inputs distant for output ports, the crossbar switch should schedule

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.070
inputs and outputs. So that traffic isn't sitting

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.910
idle at the input ports if some traffic could

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.850
be sent to the available output ports. Another

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.280
consideration in scheduling is fairness, which is to say

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.880
that given demands at the inputs, we want

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.110
to make sure that each queue at the input

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.840
is scheduled fairly for some definition of fairness. Now,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.640
defining fairness is tricky. And there are multiple possible

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.750
definitions of fairness. Here, we'll look at

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.510
an important fairness definition called max min fairness.
