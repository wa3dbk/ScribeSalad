&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As much as I love the new equation we just came up with, it took us a really

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:07.912
long time and a bunch of steps to get it in this nice form. It would be really

00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:11.880
great if we could come up with a shortcut for how to get to the same end result

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.219
without having to do quite as much work. The information that we used to develop

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.350
our equation in the last problem was a point and a slope. Let's consider a

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.909
general situation like this. Let's say that we have a line, and we know that the

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.303
slope of the line is m. We also know that this line goes through the point, s,

00:00:29.303 --> 00:00:33.910
t, where s is our x coordinate, and t is our y coordinate. I'd like to start off

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.698
by having you substitute these values in to the proper places of an equation

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:43.585
that's in slope-intercept form. So we want to start off with y equals mx plus b,

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:47.317
but then substitute in these quantities to the proper spots.
