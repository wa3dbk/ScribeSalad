00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.620
The first choice is correct. Multiplying a function by some positive constant

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.048
stretches or shrinks the graph in the Y direction, which is vertically here.

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:16.490
Since 3.3 is greater than one we have a stretch in this case. We can also see

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.460
that in our graph. The distance from the X axis up to the curve for Y equals

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.200
log base ten of X. Is just a fraction of the distance from the x axis up to our

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.650
second curve. 3.3 times log base 10 of x. This curve is identical to this one,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.990
just stretched upward. It's taller, interestingly enough then even the change

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.999
of base of a log is a transformation. That is really cool.
