Here's a typical class diagram. It has some examples and

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.440
associations. The associations don't have labels on them. There's also couple of

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.740
places where there are generalizations. As I said, the class model diagrams can

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.858
have a lot more adornments to them and we'll see those later on.
