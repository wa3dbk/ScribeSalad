00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.045
Other languages are statically typed. And this is one of the biggest differences

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:08.510
between programming languages. Here's an example of what some code statically

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.590
typed language like Java or C might look like. First, before we use a new name,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.536
say the name x, we have to declare it. And what this type declaration means is

00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:23.473
the name x that we're introducing here will only refer to values of type int.

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:28.716
So, we could assign the value 3 to x, 3 is an int. What we couldn't do is assign

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:33.037
the string hello undacious one to x. This is going to be a type error and it's a

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:37.403
type error at compile time. That means we get this error before we even run the

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:42.310
program. As an another example, if we wanted to find a function in a language

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.482
like Java or C, where we have to say what type it has. So, this is the return

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:51.042
type. And we have to give the type of each parameter. If we have code somewhere

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:55.430
else that calls the procedure with an object that is not in it. We're going to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.123
get an error at compile time.
