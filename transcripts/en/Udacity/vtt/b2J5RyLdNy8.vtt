00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.150
So to get our outputs in the correct range,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.130
we're going to use the Modulus Operator. And this

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.750
is written with a percent sign. It's usually the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.680
Shift 5 on most keyboards. What modulus does is

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.129
takes a number and maps it to the range

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.930
based on the remainder when you divide that number.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.410
So the way modulo arithmetic works, is like a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.070
clock. So if we think of having a clock with

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.910
12 hours, and then arithmetic on the clock is modulo 12. So if we

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.010
were to evaluate 14 modulo 12, what that would mean is,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.910
well, if we start from 0, and we make 14 steps, we're

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.210
going to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.070
12, 13, 14. Where we end up is 2. That's the same

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.330
as the remainder we would get by dividing 14 by 12. And

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.510
that's the result of 14 modulo 12, is 2. So now we're

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.950
going to have a few quizzes, to make sure you that understand the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.750
Modulus Operator, as well as the ord and char operators we introduced.
