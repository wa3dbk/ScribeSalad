00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.750
So, assigning a string to a variable is just

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.980
like assigning a number to a variable. We can do

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.720
that with an assignment statement. My name is Dave. So,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.360
I'll assign the string Dave, to the name, to the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.280
variable name. The nice thing about using a variable like

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.400
this, is now we could have code. Say print Hello

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.380
plus name. Here hello is a string. Name is a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.610
variable. If you assigned name to mean some other string,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.790
this will print Hello whatever the value of

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.930
name is. I've introduced a new operator here.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.580
We're using the plus operator. We already saw

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.980
plus on numbers. Now, we're using plus on strings.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.720
It means something different. What plus means with

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.340
strings is concatenation. So we can put strings

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.180
together by using the plus operator. The value

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.900
of the string plus another string is the concatenation.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.950
That's a new string that's a result of pasting

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.230
those two strings together. So let's try that in

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.680
the Python interpreter. So here I've initialized the variable

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.320
name to be the string Dave, and I'm going to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.790
print out hello plus name. You'll see I won't

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.090
get quite what I want from this? Here's what

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.190
happens, it concatenated the two strings together, it doesn't

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.140
add spaces or anything automatically. So now we've got,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.320
the output is hello Dave, without any space in

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.100
it. We need to add a space here. Now

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.210
we'll have hello space Dave, which looks more like

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.780
we want. We can keep doing this just like we

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.680
could use the plus operator with numbers more than

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.310
once, we can use it with strings more than once.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.740
Adding another string to the end, now we've got

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.050
the exclamation point I need. Maybe one is not enough.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.100
We can keep adding more exclamation points. Now I have a more pleasant reading.
