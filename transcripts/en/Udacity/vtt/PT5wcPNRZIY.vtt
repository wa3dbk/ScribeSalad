Great work if you got 4x squared z. We can see that 2 times 2, times x times x

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:09.284
times z, would be our leftover factors, so that makes 4x squared z. You might

00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:13.989
have also thought about it in your head. If you divide 36 by 9, you'll get 4.

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:18.482
And if you divide x to the 4th, by x squared, you'll get x squared. If you

00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:23.852
divide y squared by y squared, you would be left with 1. And then you have one z

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:26.293
remaining, so 4x squared z.
