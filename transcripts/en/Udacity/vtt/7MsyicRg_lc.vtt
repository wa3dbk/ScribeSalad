00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.740
To build up our understanding of precise specifications, we will use a simple

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.920
example. Sorting. Everybody intuitively knows what it means to sort a list.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.100
Everyone that is except the computer. You need to provide a sorting program too.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.180
Imagine that we want to specify a program that could sort vectors of integers,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.560
in ascending order. Let's name the program sort, and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.440
say that it takes an input argument named X, which is a vector of integers.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.950
It returns another vector of integers Y, that was a version of

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.730
X sorted in ascending order. We will begin by using First-order logic.
