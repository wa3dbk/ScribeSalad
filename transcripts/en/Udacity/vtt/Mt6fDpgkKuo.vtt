00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.935
So we have this lovely equation, which is a great start, but it's still a pretty

00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:09.613
general equation. Money spent over here, looks like just one lump sum. And

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:14.341
chances are, that Grant's not going to spend all of his money at one time. In

00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:19.251
fact, it turns out that he's made a budget for himself, where he allows himself

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:24.161
to spend $100,000 every month. So this means that over time, as each month goes

00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:28.710
by. The total amount of money that he spent will change. So this means that we

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:32.822
can rewrite money spent over here, in a different way, using this new

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:37.471
information. So, which of these choices do you think would be a new but accurate

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:41.775
way to write out the amount of money that Grant has spent total at any given

00:00:41.787 --> 00:00:42.056
time?
