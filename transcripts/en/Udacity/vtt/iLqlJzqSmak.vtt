00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.830
This is our old code, I want to demonstrate the vulnerability

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.620
in our old code so we can make sure we fixed

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.938
it. This is the old code running here and if we

00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:09.670
were to take a look at this. We're going to modify our

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.850
cookie. Document.cookie. That is the value. Let's say we want to set this to

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.840
visits to 10,001. First we need to find what the hash of 10,001. We can use

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.424
python for that. let's go ahead and try that real quick. Import hasLib,

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:30.804
hashLib.md5.("10001").hexdigest,

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:32.740
'kay. We'll take this value here. Let's

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.610
take that with us into our browser. We're

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.543
forging cookies here. So we're going to say documents.cookie

00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:45.303
equals Visits equals 10,001 pipe our new

00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:52.260
hash value, now when we reload this page, we are the best ever. But we're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.820
not the best ever, we just cheated. Okay,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.920
so, let's incorporate the new functions we just

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220
wrote into our code. So here we are in

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.900
our editor, and I've plopped in our new function. We're

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.170
going to, move secret out of the way. We are going

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.890
to pretend it is actually in another module that you

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.680
don't publish or share. And now our functions should be

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.640
as good as new. Let's try this, let's try this

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.500
out in our browser. So here we are in our

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.620
browser, we have dropped in a new hashing function so

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.710
our old cookies are going to become invalid and when we

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.660
reload the page you can see we've been here one time.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.470
If we were to inspect the cookie, document.cookie, we see that

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.720
we have this cookie. Now, it's got the same format at

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.450
the previous cookie, except this one is very hard to forge.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.080
Without knowing that secret, we, all we can do is guess

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.790
at the hash. And that's. You know, the property of the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.330
hashing algorithms is that that is basically impossible to get correct.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.250
So if I were to modify this cookie, document the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.647
cookie equals visits equals 10001. I mean what value do we

00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:57.877
even put in here. I mean we can iterate over,

00:01:57.877 --> 00:02:00.913
you know, every possible hash and just kind of guess at

00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:03.370
it and maybe get lucky. But we'd have to get

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.120
extraordinarily lucky. You see, I reloaded the page and reset down

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.240
to one. When I mean extraordinarily lucky, I mean we'd have

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.170
to you know, take more time than there are you know,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.670
atoms in the universe to figure it out. So, that's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.800
not going to work in our favor. Okay, so that's pretty

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.430
cool. I just want to summarize that algorithm so, so it's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.010
clear what we did. Instead of setting the cookie visits

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.470
equal 1, which can be easily forged And instead of setting the cookie visits

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.730
equals 1, and then the md5 of 1, which can also be,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.295
also be easily forged if you know that we're using md5. We instead set

00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:41.830
it to visits equals 1 pipe HMAC, Secret comma 1. And

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.740
as long as we keep this secret secret, they can know our

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.730
algorithm, they can know what we're doing, they can even see

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.860
our code and they won't be able to forge invalid cookies, which

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.650
is a pretty neat property. We use this all the time

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.090
because imagine, if we're not counting,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.990
instead of counting visits, we're counting

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.690
user IDs. It would be a real big problem, you know?

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.880
If, if I'm logged into, you know, my mail, my Gmail, and

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.060
I've got a cookie that identifies, you know, who I am, if somebody

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.560
could just say, well, you know, my user ID is Steve's user ID,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.160
and then, if he logged into my email, that would be a very

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.930
big problem. So, that's why you do things like this. This prevents people from

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.922
forging your cookie. And also, it saves you some effort validating on the

00:03:19.922 --> 00:03:23.234
server side, because if, if this doesn't validate, you don't have to check to

00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:25.634
see if the string is all digits and that sort of stuff because

00:03:25.634 --> 00:03:28.034
you know, it came from you, you know what you set it to, and

00:03:28.034 --> 00:03:30.748
that makes your life a little simpler. So this is a really

00:03:30.748 --> 00:03:34.920
popular strategy we're going to use for all sorts of things in this class.
