00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.290
To apply this to the segmentation
problem of vision,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.939
we have to think a little bit about what
feature space we do this in, all right?

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.810
And it turns out for an awful lot
of what we do in clustering and

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.810
segmentation, and frankly just about
everything in computer vision,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.270
the feature space you
use is what matters.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.180
So here, I'm showing you that single
line, with the idea being that

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.200
we're just a grouping along a single,
intensity space.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.940
So if I were to cluster,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.890
using just this simple intensity space
what would it do to this panda picture,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.970
and Professor Grauman in Texas,
she's got these, this thing for pandas.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.660
Actually I think she got
these pictures somewhere.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.250
Well, so let's see.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.800
So here's our panda.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.300
If I tell it that there's
going to be two centers, okay,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.880
then I would get a division
that looks like this, right?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.030
So you can see that basically, the
lighter pixels have been turned into one

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.420
region, and the darker pixels have been
turned into another region, all right?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.870
Now, if I told it instead
there were three clusters,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.480
you might look at something that
looks like this, all right?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.790
And here you can see there's the bright,
the dark, and the grey, all right?

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.000
kind of like the good,
the bad and the ugly.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:12.905
So what you're seeing here right away,

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:15.765
is one of the problems in
doing K means clustering.

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.875
We'll talk more about this, is that you
have to tell it how many clusters there

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:23.285
are, and there are methods for then
trying to figure that out beyond that,

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:27.125
but fundamental to K means is you
already know the number of clusters.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:28.645
When you do this type of clustering,

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:32.410
you can think of this as quantizing
the feature space, right?

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.880
So those of you familiar
with vector quantization,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.930
if you do it in multi-dimensional space,
the idea is you essentially carve

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.660
a continuous space up
into a set of buckets.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.560
So this segment, this clustering is
a quantization of our feature space.
