Alright, now let's try creating our own XML HTTP request. What we'd like to do is

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:10.425
requestWeapon.JSON which is the previous JSON code that we parsed.

00:00:10.537 --> 00:00:15.850
Then, once the response kicks in, we'd like the onLoad function specified

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:21.250
to parse it, like we did before, If you're a little confused, more detailed instructions

00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:22.850
are provided in the comments here.
