00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:04.030
Let's look at the solution to
our DRAM access scheduling quiz.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.596
So we have 32 arrays,
each is 16 megabits and

00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:12.740
takes a 12 bit row address,
and a 12 bit column address.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.160
Twelve bits is three hex digits, so
the row address will be the upper

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.440
three hex digits, and the column
address will be the lower hex digits.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.090
Each of these corresponds to
a 32-bit memory location.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.140
So what happens is each of these
arrays sees the same address, but

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.600
it provides a different bit for
that address.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.600
So each address will have the same
sequence of row and column addresses,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.360
it's just that they will implement
different bits of that address.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.970
So what we have here is the first one,
of course, needs to be a page open.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.770
So we have 10 nanoseconds
to open this first page.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.670
We will then read in two nanoseconds,
then we will close the page

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.040
in another five nanoseconds, because
the next one is on a different page.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.060
The row address is different.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.050
So we spent 17 nanoseconds here,
we will spend another 17 here,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.590
we will then spend another 17 here
because it's again in a different row.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.770
17 here and here and here and here.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.610
Overall, we have 7 accesses,
each to a different page, so

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.150
each of them requires 17 nanoseconds,
for

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.900
a total of 119 nanoseconds.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.210
Now let's try to reorganize these.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.560
What we want to do when we reorganize
these, is once we open a page, access

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.980
everything on that page before we move
on, which means we will open this row,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.650
and then we will access everything in
that row, which means this and this too.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.622
Now, what happens is we spend
10 nanoseconds opening that row,

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:06.323
3 times 2 nanoseconds reading
these three things, and

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:10.570
then we need to close the row
in another 5 nanoseconds.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.860
Then what happens is we
open the next row, and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.610
we read everything from that row,
which includes this too, so

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.760
we end up opening one row, reading two
things from it, and then closing it.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.770
And now we spend 17 nanoseconds for
each one of these.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.250
In total, we spent 74 nanoseconds
doing these accesses.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.420
So as you can see, when caches have
a number of pending misses and we need

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.660
to send these misses to memory, it pays
to rearrange the order of the addresses

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.560
we are accessing to benefit from
the organization of the data.
