00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.855
Now that you've worked so hard to figure out the vertex form of our equation,

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:08.087
I've decided to show you the graph. Now I'll actually write the equation for the

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:12.346
parabola in both forms, vertex form and standard form. And I'd like you to tell

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:16.686
me what the roots of this parabola are. Remember simplify and write the answers

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:18.261
in as compact a way as you can.
