00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.620
So, finally, I just want to
talk about a couple of issues

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.360
that you'll always face
when you're doing tracking.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.180
So the first one is initialization.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.030
How do you start the thing?

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.270
And there's no good answer.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.010
The examples I showed you
before were done manually.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.290
Somebody says, oh, track that.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.460
Okay?
So you draw a little ser, you say,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.280
keep track of that thing.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.390
You might have a background
subtraction method.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.490
Okay, so every now and then, you may
be able to subtract that background,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.280
find the objects.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.276
And say okay, keep track of that
object because it's isolated.

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:34.982
And I'm going to track it as it
moves along even when it becomes

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:39.130
like partially occluded or, or
with other moving things in the way.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.165
Or, you might have a detector that can
detect things when they're clear and

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:45.824
fully visible, right?

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:48.141
So I've got a a bank robber detector.

00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:48.906
No.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:52.427
I, I might have a particular
car detector and it'll say, oh,

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.827
a jeep has just shown up.

00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:55.880
Follow that jeep.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.300
So the detector is running, and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.300
it'll only fire sometimes, when it
gets a good, clear view of something.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.950
But then you want to track and
follow it through.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.370
Next question is where do you get your
sensor and your dynamics models from?

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.000
Well we've talked
a little bit about this,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.380
your dynamics models you maybe can
learn by essentially from real data.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.630
That's generally pretty hard.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.370
Because if you could track the real
data without the dynamics model,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.600
you wouldn't be using
the dynamics model.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.130
So, you might use it from clean data.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.040
Remember we talked about
the girl jumping in front of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.030
the black background?

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.570
That would be some clean data.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.850
Or it says here you might
specify domain knowledge.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.660
That means you're,
like, the smart person.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.840
You just write down what it is.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.620
Or you take another trip to Delphi, and
you get another thing from an oracle.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.800
Now, for the observation model,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.920
typically, it says generative
observation model.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.060
What that means is,
remember we did the, the model for

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.790
the robot sensing distance.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.290
So if I knew the,
the wall was three meters away.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.410
And I take some measurements.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.750
And, I collect them and
I get a distribution.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.200
Now I know what my
distribution would be.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.960
The trick is, I had to know that the
thing was actually three meters away, or

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.560
two meters away.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.430
Right, I have to know the ground truth.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.370
So you have some sort of
absolute sense or measurement.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.800
Prediction versus correction,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.080
remember this whole thing
about tracking and inferences.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.740
I make some prediction, I take some
measurements, I do my correction.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.300
The question is,
what's that relevant trade-off?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.413
Remember we talked about
this in Kalman filter,

00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:23.850
which basically came down to what's
the relative size of the noise of my

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.250
measurements versus
the noise of my process.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.390
Actually, we usually do
it the other way around,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.530
the noise of my process versus
the noise in my measurements.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.710
If one is too strong,
you'll ignore the data.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.910
If the other is too strong,
you'll ignore the predictions.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.750
So getting those balanced right
is just a little bit of magic

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.690
that you have to do based
upon looking at the data.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.170
Here's a more interesting or
I should say fundamental one and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.410
it's referred to as data association.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.740
Data association basically
is what if we don't know

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.760
which measurements to
associate with which tracks?
