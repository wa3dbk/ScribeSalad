00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.124
For the next practice problem on solving absolute value equations, we're going

00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:08.361
to try the absolute value of 3x plus 6 equals 0. Now since 0 is neither positive

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:12.478
nor negative, there's only going to be one solution. You can put your answer in

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.833
this box. So do your best.
