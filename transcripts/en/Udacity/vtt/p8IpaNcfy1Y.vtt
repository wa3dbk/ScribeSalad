00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.730
So, this is going to be a little bit technical, but do try to follow along.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.564
It's very, very important. Now, let's take a closer look at the action

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:12.414
potential, or as it's sometimes called, the nerve impulse. The action potential

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:16.948
is an electrical impulse that travels along the axon. That is surrounded by a

00:00:16.948 --> 00:00:22.112
semipermeable membrane that allows only certain ions to cross through it. Ions

00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:26.680
are chemically charged particles that are found inside and outside the cells.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.090
In its resting state, the fluid outside the axon contains a higher

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.650
concentration of positive ions than the inside of the axon. Which has many

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.558
negatively charged ions. This resting potential is measured at negative 70

00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:44.406
millivolts, or thousandths of a volt. So, neurons do not stay in this resting

00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:48.814
state. Rather, they can change and do change when an impulse increases the

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:53.786
positive charge inside the neuron to a certain threshold. The neuron becomes

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:58.401
locally depolarized to a charge of positive 40 millivolts and fires an action

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:04.887
potential or a nerve impulse. The action potential travels along the axon to

00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:09.404
signal to other neurons. More specifically during an action potential, sodium

00:01:09.404 --> 00:01:13.971
ions, that are positive charges, enter the axon. After the action potential

00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:18.606
occurs, potassium ions cross outside the cells. And then, the neuron must

00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:23.056
transport these ions to return to it's resting state. This results in a

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:27.950
refractory period wherein the neuron cannot generate another action potential.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.506
This entire process from start to finish lasts only about five milliseconds, or

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:38.182
five 1000 of a second. So, one important point to make is that every time a

00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:42.076
neuron fires it fires to the same degree or amount goes up to positive 40

00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:48.470
millivolts no more, no less. This is known as the all or none principle.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.691
Stronger responses involve simply more neurons firing not individual neurons

00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:57.251
firing more strongly. So, if you want to find out more about some of these

00:01:57.251 --> 00:02:00.617
technical details, you can find that information on some links that we'll post

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:02.470
on the web.
