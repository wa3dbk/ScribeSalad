00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.689
If we're talking about paying for 75 gallons of solution, we need to think about

00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:09.225
three points of intersection made by each of the three company lines, and our

00:00:09.237 --> 00:00:13.760
very familiar now vertical x equals 75 line. If we're curious about the least

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:17.995
amount Grant could pay, we need to see which one of these three points of

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:22.872
intersection has the lowest y value, or the smallest y coordinate. Of these

00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:28.912
three points of intersection, this one is the lowest, so it must be the one that

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:34.583
we're interested in. The Y value of this point, if we follow this grid line

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:40.465
over, looks to be 500, 600, 700, 800. So the best deal that Grant could get if

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:46.180
he wants to buy 75 gallons of solution will be paying $800. This point that

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:51.860
we're talking about is a point of intersection between the purple line and the

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:57.508
orange line, and the orange line corresponds to company 2. So company 2 is the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.368
one that's going to give him the $800 deal on 75 gallons of solution.
