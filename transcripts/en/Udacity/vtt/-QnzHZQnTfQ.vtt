00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
But if we can't figure out a way to make the calls easier,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
then we're going to have to concentrate on having fewer calls.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let me write down some possibilities for fewer calls and see which ones

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
you think make sense.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One possibility would be for each equation, like ODD plus ODD equals EVEN,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
rather than evaluating them all N factorial times, maybe we could combine all of those

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
into one big equation.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Certainly that would result in fewer calls if we could figure out a way to do that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and still get the right answer.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Another way might be to, say, could we figure out a way to fill in one digit at a time?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Rather than do all N factorial permutations of digits,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
if we could do one digit, see if that works, and if it does then do the next digit.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That would certainly help us do a smaller number of calls.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's the approach we took with the zebra function where we started out

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
by doing all the permutations, and then we figured out let's go through

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and if there's a contradiction, let's stop and not do the remaining ones.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The question is can we figure out a way to take that general approach for this problem.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Then the third approach would be to eval the formula once but eval it as a function

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
with parameters.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
To do all the work of figuring out how to understand number plus number equals number,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
do that just once and then call that function repeatedly with all the permutations.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
There'd still be lots of calls to the function, but there'd be fewer calls to eval.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Tell me which one of these three do you think is the most promising.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Again, it's a matter of opinion.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You might have better ideas, but I want you to think about it

00:01:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and tell me what you think.
