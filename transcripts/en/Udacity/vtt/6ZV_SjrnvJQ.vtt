00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.744
So what I want you to do is add an assertion to the code that will give a

00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:08.003
failure when inputs are invalid in this way. And the syntax for assertions are

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:12.005
you can do assert followed by any python expression if the value of the

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:16.653
expression is False the assertion fails execution will stop with an exception.
