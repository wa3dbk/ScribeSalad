00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.590
Let us consider what happens when a third example comes along.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.200
And the green outline of this example shows that this is the positive example of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.180
the concept. Because this is the positive example of the concept, we must try to

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.350
generalize the most specific model. So a generalization of the specific concept,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.640
that includes this positive example as shown here. Here the meal was breakfast,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.920
here the meal was lunch. So we can generalize over any meal.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.490
Here the day was Saturday, here it was Friday, so we can generalize over

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.910
any day. Of course we could have also generalized just Friday or

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.260
Saturday, but for simplicity we'll generalize over any day. Similarly for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.760
breakfast or lunch, generalized to any meal. But at this stage, there is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.320
another element to the processing. We must examine all the specializations of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.460
the most general concept and see whether any one of them needs to be pruned out.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.760
The pruning may need to be done in order to make sure that each

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.310
specialization here is consistent with the positive examples that are coming in.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.780
So in this case, if we look at the first specialization here,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.000
which says, I'm allergic to breakfast at any place on any day.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.040
This cannot be a generalization of this particular concept. Put another way,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.610
there is no way that this breakfast here can include, can cover,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.240
this positive example which deals with lunch. But yet another way,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.970
the only way I can move from breakfast to any here would be if I generalize, but

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.300
in this direction I can only specialize. Therefore, this must be pruned out.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.159
As you prune this first concept out, we're left with only two.
