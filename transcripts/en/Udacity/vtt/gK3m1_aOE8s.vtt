00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.200
As far as the scroll bar is concerned, scroll bars are one graphical way of

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.430
supplying numbers to other parts of an application. Were going to use

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.650
a traditional scroll bar in which there's it's going to be a vertical

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.870
scroll bar and it's going to have a movable part of it. That is the user

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.890
can move a part called the handle which sits in a tray. So you can move up and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.170
down, and we when we use the terms handle and tray to indicate that we can set,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.250
the user can set the position in the file by by moving this handle up and

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.460
down on the tray. The handle position denotes that part of the file that

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.600
should be displayed in the view port. So when you move it all the way up,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.540
you get the start of the file, and when you move it all the way down,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.780
you get the end of the file. Also, the size of the handle in proportion to

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.300
the size of the tray denotes the portion of the file that is visible. So

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.170
if all of the file contents fit into the viewport, you'd expect the tray to be,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.710
filled up. And if we have a gigantic file, that in a very small window,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.180
we'd expect just a thin handle to appear in the scroll bar.
