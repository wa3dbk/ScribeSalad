00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.590
You have just seen how to write a program that determines the largest of a

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.572
number of input values, but that program had an annoying flaw. The user had to

00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:11.286
type in all of the values and if there are a lot of them that can get really

00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:15.921
tedious. What we really want to do is read the values from a file. To read a

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:20.965
value from a file, you can use the scanner class. But you construct the scanner

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:25.780
with an object of a file class. And in turn you need to construct that file

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.966
object by giving the name of the input file. Now, there's a bit of a catch

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.748
here, when we put this code inside the main method, we need to deal with the

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:39.669
possibility that there is no file called input.text. If that file was indeed

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:43.634
missing, then the file constructor would terminate with what's called a file

00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:48.810
not found exception. That exception is considered so serious that we must tell

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.676
Java that we are aware of it. That's done by putting this class throws

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:58.679
FileNotFoundException behind main. We're not covering exception handling in

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.151
this course, so this is just another one of those things that I'm going to have

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:07.023
to ask you to just do. Once we're done with this, everything else is easy, now

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:11.894
the scanner works. Every bit as the scanner you've been using quite a bit. You

00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:16.500
can simply call has next double, and then read a value by calling next double.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.106
Well, have a go at it. Modify the program that computes the largest value, so

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:24.380
that it reads the values from a file.
