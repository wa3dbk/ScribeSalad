00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.272
So in the intermediate stages of the merge,

00:00:02.272 --> 00:00:06.042
we have all the SMs working on independent merges, one SM per merge.

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:09.208
At some point though, when we get to the very top of the merge tree,

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:13.516
we only have a very small number of merges left or eventually, just one.

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:18.752
We have a single task, but it's a very big task. Now, why is this bad?

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:24.176
Why is it problematic for efficiency that we only have one merging task remaining?

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:30.665
So why is this bad? Why is it problematic for efficiency that we have only one merging task remaining?

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:35.676
Well, could be a number of things. We could have lots of idle threads per SM,

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:40.926
We could just have lots of SMs that are idle, or we might suffer from very high branch divergence.

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:43.387
So please check the one you think is the best answer.
