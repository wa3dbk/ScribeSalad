00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.910
Trees inherently aren't
really organized.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.500
When we use a tree, we know what
the overall structure looks like, but

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.860
we don't know where
a specific element will be.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.719
It turns out that we can add some rules
about the ordering of elements to our

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.560
trees to accomplish
certain tasks really fast.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.930
In the coming videos,
we'll talk about some common tree types

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.450
with specific rules regarding
the ordering of elements.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.910
As we go, don't let yourself get so

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.960
caught up in understanding the types of
trees that you forget the big picture.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.140
When would you want to
use these structures?

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290
What tasks would they speed up?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.339
What are the pros and
cons of each approach?
