00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.350
This is all well and good if our numbers work out nicely. But what if we don't

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.295
have numbers that are as pretty as these? That work this easily together. Let's

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:14.000
stick with 4 to the x. But how about on the right hand side of the equation, we

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.241
put something different, like 121. Now, this problem is not as simple as the

00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:24.482
last 2 .We can't easily make 121 into a power of 4. So I think we need to go

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:29.271
back to our knowledge of properties. In particular, properties of exponents and

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:34.050
logs. We have some one-to-one properties. There's this one that we just talked

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.172
about. If we know that A to the x equals A to the y, then we also know that x

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:44.038
equals y. And similarly, we have this second one. If we know that log base A of

00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:49.870
x is equal to log base A o fy, then we also know that x equals y. We also have

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.215
some inverse properties. Properties that demonstrate that exponential and

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:59.156
logarithmic functions are each other's inverses. The first one is that a to the

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:05.385
power of log base a of x is equal to x. Here's the first one. a to the power of

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:11.150
log base a of x equals x. And the second one says that log base a of a to the x

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.160
is equal to x. This is just showing that logs and exponents undo one another.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.966
Now, keeping these in mind, let's go back to that equation we were working

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:26.334
with. And here it is again. 4 to the x equals 121. Now as we did in earlier

00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:29.694
lessons, I think we should take the log of both sides, after all we want to

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:35.212
extract the x from the exponent here. One of those two inverse properties was

00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:39.052
this one, that if we have something like a to the x, just as we do here, if we

00:01:39.052 --> 00:01:45.850
take log base a of that we'll just end up with x on this side of the equation.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.744
That sounds pretty good to me. So thinking about the equation that we have,

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:54.320
what base should the log that we apply to both sides be? In other words, what

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.009
should a here equal?
