00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.770
Now I'm going to walk through how to
set up a collection view in Storyboard.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.380
There are two ways to set up
table view controllers and

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.650
collection view
controllers in Storyboard.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.315
The first way you've seen before.

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:13.391
You start with the regular
UIViewController like this one.

00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:16.660
And then you drag in a table view or
a collection view.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.560
The second option is to use
a Table View Controller like this one.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.360
Or a Collection View Controller
like this one.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.216
In the table views lesson,
we used option one.

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:30.431
Now we'll set up our Collection
View Controller using option two.

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:33.391
Here I've opened to
the Bond Villains in Tabs project.

00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.270
But this version doesn't have
a Collection View Controller set up yet.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.130
To access this project, switch to the
git branch in the instructor's notes.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.010
Now open up the Bond Villains
in Tabs project so

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.290
that you can follow along with
me as I go through the steps to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.420
add a Collection View Controller
to your project.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020
The first step is to drag
in a Navigation Controller.

00:00:55.798 --> 00:00:58.940
Next, you'll want to delete the Root
View Controller that automatically

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.750
came with that Navigation Controller.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.450
Next you'll want to drag in
a Collection View Controller, and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.118
this item is of the class
UICollectionViewController.

00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:12.940
Next up, Ctrl+click on that
Navigation Controller and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.290
set its Root View Controller to be
the Collection View Controller you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.720
just added.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.530
Remember that we want our collection
view to show up in our tab bar.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.040
To accomplish that, first Ctrl+click on
the Tab Bar Controller and we want to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.460
add this second Navigation Controller
to our view controllers array.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.910
So we can drag here from
the view controllers array, and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.930
add that second Navigation Controller.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.810
Next, we need to set the name of
the Collection View Controller to match

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.010
the name of the class where all our
collection view methods are implemented.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.900
To do that we click on
the Collection View Controller and

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.140
then open up the Identity Inspector
on the right.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.040
Here under Class, we're going to put
Villain Collection View Controller.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.580
Of course,
when you're setting this up for

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.980
Meme Me, you're going to put sent
Memes Collection View Controller.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.410
Next, we're going to configure
our Collection View cell.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.280
In order to do that, let's open
up the Outline View on the left.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.000
Here, in the outline, under
Villain Collection View Controller,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.900
we can see the Collection View cell.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Go ahead and click on it.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.860
We need to set the name of the cells
class to match the custom cell class

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.700
that we implemented earlier.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.790
So up here under Class in
the Identity Inspector,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.308
we're going to put
Villain Collection View Cell.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.270
And when you're setting up Meme Me,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.250
you'll type in whatever name you
used for your custom cell class.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.100
Now, I'm just going to make this
collection view cell a little bit

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.930
bigger, and
then I'm going to drag in an image view.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.449
Right now, I'm just dragging in
an image view for testing purposes.

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:49.780
I just want to be able to see the cells
so that I know I set them up correctly.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.310
Now I need to connect an outlet
to this UI image view.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.960
So you can see here that I've
opened up the Assistant Editor.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.395
And we've got our
VillainCollectionViewCell.swift file

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:01.715
here on the right.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.115
Now to connect the outlet,

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:07.685
all I do is drag from the circle
to the UIImageView in Storyboard.

00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:08.615
Last, but not least,

00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:13.198
we need to make sure we set the reuse
identifier for our collection view cell.

00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:16.480
So you'll want to make sure you click
on the Collection View Cell, and

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.730
then you'll go over here to
the Attributes Inspector, and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.730
under Identifier,
put VillainCollectionViewCell.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.430
All right, let's run it and
see what we've got.

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:31.175
All right, there's our collection view
and it seems to be loading data fine.

00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:32.603
And in the next session,

00:03:32.603 --> 00:03:36.819
I'm going to talk about how to use the
class UICollectionView flow layout so

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.955
that you can arrange these
cells the way you want them.
