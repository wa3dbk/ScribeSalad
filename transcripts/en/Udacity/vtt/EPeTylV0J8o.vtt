00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.340
Over the last few lessons, we've
advanced from electronic record systems

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.300
for providers and patients to
technologies for querying those

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.260
systems and aggregating data for
potentially interesting purposes.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.450
In our final lesson, we'll see just how
interesting some of those results can be

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.465
as we delve into what is arguably the
most dynamic area of Health Informatics

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:24.820
today, big data and analytics.
