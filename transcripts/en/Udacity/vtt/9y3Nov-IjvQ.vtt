00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.969
Let's step through this now with
an example of how a minimizer

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.280
would try to find the coefficients
of a line that best fits this data.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.260
So keep in mind that we have to
give the minimizer an equation

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.060
that it has to minimize.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.550
And what we're going to give
it is that error metric.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.150
In fact we used squared error.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.290
So we might guess an initial C0 and
C1 and that would be a line

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.750
like this, and we would give that
to the minimizer and let it go.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.850
So it would measure the error
with this particular line,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.900
it would fiddle with these
values a little bit and

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.620
see how much the error changed, try
a new set of values see how that works.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.070
And eventually it's going to iterate,
and

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.700
eventually it's going to settle on
what it thinks is the best solution.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.400
So key points here are that
we express the problem for

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.660
the minimizer as
a minimization problem and

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.350
we give it the equation
to minimize as the error.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.790
And then, what it finds now instead
of x is it finds the values for

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.480
these coefficients.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.660
So, let me show you how
to do that now in code.
