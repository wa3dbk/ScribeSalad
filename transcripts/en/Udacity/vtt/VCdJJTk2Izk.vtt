00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.519
If our critical region is only up here, above the mean. Then, any sample mean

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:11.168
in this yellow, or orange, area will be considered likely. However, with a z

00:00:11.168 --> 00:00:17.370
score of negative 2.59, would we necessarily consider that likely? So instead,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.940
let's split the critical region in 2. Again, let's focus on just the alpha

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.760
level of 0.05 for now. If we split 0.05 in 2, then that means 2.5% is on this

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.716
side. I drew this 2.5% disproportionately larger just so you can see. But let's

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:45.135
just pretend that this area in blue is 2.5%. And that also means that 2.5% is

00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:52.499
on this side. So in total they make 5%. So this is for an alpha level of 0.05.

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.576
So this means we have different z critical values. What is this z critical

00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:03.163
value that should go here? Just write it as a positive value.
