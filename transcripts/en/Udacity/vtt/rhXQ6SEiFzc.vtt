00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.166
Well, if I'm traveling downstream, I can travel 8 miles per hour. And if I'm

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.805
traveling upstream, I can only go 2 miles per hour. Good work if you figured

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.676
these two out. One way to think about this is just by adding two vectors. We

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:17.912
know that I can travel at 5 miles per hour. And a current's going to help me

00:00:17.912 --> 00:00:22.558
along. So, that's going to push me another 3 miles per hour. Now this only

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:28.445
happens when I travel downstream, I get pushed along by the current. So, my

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:33.520
total speed would be 8 miles per hour. But let's say I decide to swim upstream

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.719
instead. Notice that the current is going against me. We're moving in opposite

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.446
directions. This means that my rate of 5 miles per hour is slowed down by 3

00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:47.690
miles per hour. So, I can only travel at 2 miles per hour.
