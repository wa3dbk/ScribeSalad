00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.690
As you can see the randomized algorithms generally have much better time bounds

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.800
or well they might not seem much, but you already know that for exponential time algorithms

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.940
little differences here so 1.47 versus 1.32 actually makes quite a difference

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.500
so they have generally a lot better time bounds than the deterministic algorithms

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.769
It seems that randomized algorithms allows us to achieve

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.860
a better worst-case running time than deterministic algorithms.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.780
Of course, up here it has the advantage that it's actually done after this amount of time

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.270
whereas down here, it's always an expected running time

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.720
and as I said you're gambling a little bit.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.079
You cannot be 100% sure that the algorithm

00:00:38.079 --> 99:59:59.000
has found a satisfying assignment even though there might be one.
