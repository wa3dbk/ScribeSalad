00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.134
So the cycles, per instruction, we spent in the

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:05.724
pipe line should be one once we have filled

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:09.520
our pipe line. Note that we have building instructions

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.750
to process in a program usually. So the first

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.201
few cycles are negligible, we can just ignore them

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.253
and say that in the steady state we're just

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:21.320
finishing one instruction every cycle. Is that true, however?

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.103
So the reasons why we don't always get the flow

00:00:25.103 --> 00:00:28.110
rate of one are the initial filling of

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.390
the pipeline. But even with the initial fill, the

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.880
CPI will get closer and closer to one

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.532
as the number of instructions grows, and because we

00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:41.935
have many, many instructions this is not really

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:44.340
a big problem. Our CPI could be set to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.490
be one in spite of this. The CPI in the steady state is not one also because

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.080
of pipeline stalls. Think about, for example, a car

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.900
production line where the first stage is to install the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.340
doors. The second stage is to install front wheels,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.930
the next stage is to install the rear wheels and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.510
there are many more stages. And let's say that

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.800
at some point we have a black car here, with

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.730
the front wheels already installed, a purple car here, waiting

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.480
to install the front wheels and the green car here,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.620
still without the doors. It's installing the doors. Let's

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.650
say that during the installation of the front wheels here,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.780
the machine damages the wheel. So now what happens

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.830
is when the production line can move on because the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.540
rear wheels have been installed on the black car,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.370
the black car can move on to the next stage,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.140
and it has the rear wheels installed,. But we don't

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.500
want to move the purple car here because it still

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.370
doesn't have the front wheels. If we let that happen

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.450
we'll end up with a car that has no front

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.720
wheels. So the purple cars will stay in this install

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.140
front wheels stage for one more cycle to have a new

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.640
set of wheels installed. Because the purple car didn't move

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.428
on, the worker over here is idle because there is

00:02:00.428 --> 00:02:03.012
no car to install the rear wheels in this cycle

00:02:03.012 --> 00:02:06.412
and because the purple car didn't move on, the green car,

00:02:06.412 --> 00:02:09.860
whose doors have been installed, cannot move on. So

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.480
we have an idle stage here, too. Let's say that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.760
the wheels are correctly installed this time here. Now the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.810
purple car moves on. The next stage of the pipeline,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.620
however, gets to do nothing because no car has moved

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.722
on. The green car will now move here. And we

00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:28.510
will begin a new car here for installing the doors.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.630
So the problem is that when the black car leaves

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.430
the pipeline there will be one car worth of

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.390
time where we don't finish car and only then

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.134
the purple car will come. So every one of

00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:43.984
these breaks in the pipeline, that stall the pipeline, it

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:46.987
cannot move on, will result in not finishing a

00:02:46.987 --> 00:02:50.206
car, when a car should have been finished. If

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:53.692
these stalls happen on a regular basis, the CP,I

00:02:53.692 --> 00:02:56.710
will not be one, it will be lower than one.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.941
For example, if every five cars we have this, then really takes, six cycles to

00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:09.000
finish five cars. So the CPI is six cycles over five cars, and we end up

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.195
with a CPI of 1.2 not one. So even the steady state pipeline CPI will

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.577
be larger than one, meaning we don't finish

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:23.370
an instruction every cycle because of pipeline stalls.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.642
So we have seen how a stall can happen in

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:29.152
a car pipeline because of broken wheels or something. But

00:03:29.152 --> 00:03:32.068
in a processor pipeline how can it be that we

00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:35.390
have a stall? So what goes broken with an instruction?
