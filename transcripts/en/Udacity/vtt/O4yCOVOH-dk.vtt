Thanks, Lauren. We see that aggression is a part of our lives. However, on the

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:09.943
bright side, we also see that as humans we engage in pro-social behavior. We

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.663
would like to start this part of the lesson by going back to the first lesson

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:18.355
on what is psychology? Do you remember when we talked about Kitty Genovese?

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.323
Recall that Kitty Genovese was walking home to her apartment after work late

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:27.147
one night. And a man attacked her outside of her apartment building, she

00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:32.729
screamed and people turned their lights on. Then the attacker ran away, however

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.619
nobody called the police. Next, the attacker returned and people heard more

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:44.395
screams, and still nobody called the police. And then in the end, he ended up

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:49.279
killing Kitty. How is it that such a long drawn out murder can happen, and so

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:53.419
many people can hear the attack, and yet no one, well one person out of 38,

00:00:53.419 --> 00:01:00.150
even so much as calls the police? To answer this question, two researchers

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.434
Darley and Latane designed an experiment to study what they came to call the

00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:11.105
Bystander Effect. Let's take a closer look at how this study was designed. The

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:14.680
researchers had participants who were talking to each other via headsets, it

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.310
turns out that the recordings were actually pre-recorded and the participant

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.037
was interacting with those pre-recorded conversations. In addition, the group

00:01:24.037 --> 00:01:28.782
sizes varied, some thought that they were alone with one other person, others

00:01:28.782 --> 00:01:35.203
thought they were in larger groups. Next, some time during the conversation the

00:01:35.203 --> 00:01:40.443
participant heard someone choking. Now, remember this was pre-recorded but the

00:01:40.443 --> 00:01:45.690
participant did not know that. Now before we move forward with the results.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.087
What would you do in that type of situation? You don't have to type an answer,

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:51.100
but think about it for a moment.
