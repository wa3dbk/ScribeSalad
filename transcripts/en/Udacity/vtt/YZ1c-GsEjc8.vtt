00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.867
Okay. Let's work through some code.

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:05.410
Now in this series of coding exercises I'm going to show you,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.413
I'm going to be transposing a matrix, and the coordinates of this matrix are going to be giving us I and J.

00:00:11.413 --> 00:00:17.636
I refers to the column of an element, J refers to the row of an element.

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:20.555
Now, this matrix is going to be laid out in row major order,

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:28.397
meaning that in memory all the elements of a given row will be adjacent and in the next row, and then in the next row, and so on.

00:00:28.397 --> 00:00:33.833
And remember that our goal is to take for every element IJ,

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.779
we want to switch it with element JI. So that's what the code is going to do.

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:41.845
Let me slide this over here as a reference, and I'll bring up the code window.

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:47.480
So here's how you would code transpose on a serial machine like a CPU, really simple code.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.191
I'm going to pass in 2 matrices in and out, and I'm going to walk through a 4 loop that loops over the rows,

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:58.390
J, and within each row loops over the column,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.834
and then this is where you can tell that the matrix is laid out in row major order.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:10.235
I, J in the input matrix maps to J, I in the output matrix. Okay, really simple,

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:17.067
and here's how you would call that code. So, I'm going to allocate a few matrices,

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:24.225
an input matrix and an output matrix. And I call this little utility routine fill_matrix,

00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:28.595
which is just going to put a bunch of consecutive numbers inside the matrix.

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:33.556
I call the transpose routine, and I'm going to put the result in the matrix I call gold,

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:36.857
meaning that this is our golden reference. We know that this code is correct,

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:42.600
and we're going to compare the various GPU versions that we code to this golden reference and then print it.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.000
Okay. So let's compile and run this code.
