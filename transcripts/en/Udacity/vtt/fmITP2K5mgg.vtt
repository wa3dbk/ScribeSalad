To test whether exactly one of them is a three, you would be interested in two

00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:09.094
cases. One where x is 3, and y is not. And the other where y is 3, and x is

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:13.996
not. If this case is true, or this case is true, then exactly one of them is a

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:21.433
3. In code, that would look like this. We have, x is 3 and y is not or x is not

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:24.893
3 but y is.
