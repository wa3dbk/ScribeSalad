00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.890
So if we're going to be talking about strategies

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.090
in this game that has an uncertain ending,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.110
we can't just write down sequences of, of

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.680
actions anymore. We can't just say cooperate, defect, defect,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.990
defect, defect. Or even some kind of tree

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.950
of possibilities. Because those are going to be finite

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.240
representations. We need some other representation that allows

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.600
us to play for an unbounded number of rounds.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.381
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:26.000
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to start off by presenting

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.480
an example of such a strategy, one that's,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.400
that's very famous for the iterated prisoner's dilemma,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.900
and it's called tit for tat. And the structure of tit for tat goes like this, on

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.490
the first round of the game, A player

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.220
playing this strategy will cooperate, and then in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.630
all future rounds, the player is going to

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.180
copy the opponents previous move. Does that make sense?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.009
&gt;&gt; It does. So basically, we start, I

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.474
start out, acting as if, you're going to cooperate

00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:54.517
with me. And the moment you don't cooperate with me, I will start

00:00:54.517 --> 00:00:59.000
to defect, and we'll be in the, the old style prisoners' dilemma. Right?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.752
&gt;&gt; Well no, not. What this says is that it actually copies

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:06.270
the opponent's previous move. So if, if an opponent goes cooperate, defect,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.290
cooperate, defect, cooperate, defect, defect, defect,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.080
defect, cooperate, cooperate, cooperate. You're going to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.770
see something very similar coming out of the tit for tat agent.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.240
&gt;&gt; I see, I see, I see.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.890
&gt;&gt; In fact, we can represent the strategy as

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620
a little finite state machine, like this.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that, okay.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.800
&gt;&gt; And you, so you can see exactly how it kind of proceeds. It starts

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.630
off cooperating. And then in each, each round it waits to see what the opponent

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.350
does. That's the green letters here. And

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.490
then it follows the corresponding arrow, to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.160
determine whether it is going to cooperate

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.210
or defect in the, in the current round.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.060
&gt;&gt; Sure, that makes sense.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.660
&gt;&gt; So in this picture, the black letters here

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.090
represent my move. And the green letters represent my observation

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.460
of the opponent's move. Or at least if I'm being tit for tat.
