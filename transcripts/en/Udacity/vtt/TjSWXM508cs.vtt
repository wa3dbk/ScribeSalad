00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.150
In addition to the numeric data, there are several other benefits and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.508
costs to be aware of. Individual skills can be enhanced by looking at other

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:13.099
people's artifacts. There's some evidence to suggests that lightweight reviews,

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.844
those involving the author and a couple of other people doing desk checking,

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:20.410
are more effective in finding defects per staff hour. Of course,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.840
this does not mean that more total defects are detected and when using them,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.030
it is more difficult to collect overall organizational data.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.080
Your organization is going to have to learn from trying out various

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.380
approaches as to what's the most effective approach within that organization.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.917
You should also be aware of the so-called ego effect. That is, the knowledge

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:43.303
that an author's artifact will be reviewed tends to improve the quality of

00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:46.650
the delivered artifact. That is if you're going to show what you're doing to

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.900
somebody else, you're going to make it better. However, there's a danger of

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.270
damaged egos when an author is confronted with his or her defects. Collectively,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.420
there is also what is called the big-brother effect, in which stress levels

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.080
are raised because people know they are being watched and measured.
