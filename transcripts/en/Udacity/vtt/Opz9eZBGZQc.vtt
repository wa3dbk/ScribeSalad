00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.270
That ends the, the,
the basic discussion about.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.500
It was actually done for stereo reasons
which is kind of funny because in stereo

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.990
you know that points have to
move along the epipolar line.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.760
Whereas in motion they can move
however they happen to move.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.800
But it was originally derived
in a stereo formulation.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.140
It's actually used a lot more now in
the whole process of, of doing motion.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.800
To actually make work, you, you're going
to have to do things hierarchically,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.860
that is, you are going to do
things at a core scale and

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.270
then get to a finer scale and
a finer scale.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.840
And, it's a really good example of doing
multiscale processing on images, and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.740
that's actually why we're
going to do it next time
