00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.400
So, we have an equation for slope between 2 points. Let's practice using it.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.915
What is the slope between these 2 points? This point is 4, 6. And this point is

00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:13.381
7, 3. Now, you may have a hard time with this. Because I haven't told you which

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:17.774
point is point 1 or which is point 2. Maybe it won't be a problem, though. Why

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:21.288
don't you give it a shot? Write your final answer in this box.
