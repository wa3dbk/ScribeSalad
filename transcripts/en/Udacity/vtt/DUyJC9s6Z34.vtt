00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.091
We have 2 fractions on the right hand side of the equation right now. So Id like

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.108
us to combine them. Think about the least common multiple of 4a squared and a

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:12.201
is. And that will be the denominator. And then think about what the enumerator

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:13.598
will become based on that.
