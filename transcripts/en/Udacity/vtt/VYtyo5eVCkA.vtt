00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.170
Back in the 1970s, when I was
involved in developing an early EMR,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.350
the data collection
problem was already clear.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.590
In fact, for the most part,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.300
our physicians dictated notes that
were transcribed into the EMR.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.300
I used to tell visitors that someday,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.510
voice recognition would make this
far more efficient and accurate.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.510
Has that day arrived?

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.490
To answer that question,
we'll look at M*Modal,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.710
one of the most advanced medically
specific voice recognition technologies.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.720
As shown here, it not only
translates voice to text, but

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.060
it recognizes clinical
concepts in that text and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.296
can code them into ICD-9 or SNOMED.

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:51.686
Here, 346.9 is the ICD-9 code for
migraine headache.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:56.739
62972009 is actually the SNOMED CT
code for an extraction,

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.964
showing that at least at the time this
slide was made, which was a number

00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:07.626
of years ago, the system was not exactly
perfect, because there is actually

00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:12.710
a better SNOMED CT code that is
specific to wisdom tooth extraction.
