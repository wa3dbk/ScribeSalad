00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.070
Now early versions of HTTP, actually only had

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.480
one request or response for every TCP connection. On

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.770
the plus side, this is simple to implement.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.590
But the main drawback is that is requires a

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.810
TCP connection, for every request. Thereby introducing a

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.790
lot of overhead and slowing transfer. First of all

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.180
we need a TCP three-way handshake for every

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.190
request, and TCP must start in slow start every

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.970
time the connection opens. This is exacerbated

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.380
by the fact that short transfers are very

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.640
bad for TCP because TCP is always stuck in slow start and never gets a chance

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.610
to actually ramp up to steady state

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.050
transfer. Also, as TCP connections are terminated after

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.540
every request is completed, the servers have many

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.630
connections that are forced to keep TCP connections

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.110
in time-wait states until the timers expire, thus resulting in additional

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.010
resources that the server needs to keep reserved even after the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.050
connections have completed. So a solution to increased efficiency and account

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.600
for many of these drawbacks is to use something called persistent connections.
