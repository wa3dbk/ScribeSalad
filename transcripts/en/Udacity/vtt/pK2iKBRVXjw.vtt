00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.270
Congratulations, you just did a lot of stuff. Let's do

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.069
a recap. You've wrote your first lines of code and

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:08.773
deployed it to App Engine. You got Conference Central up

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:13.550
and running. And you've tried out the API Explorer. Don't underestimate

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.610
the API Explorer. It's a great tool to use to

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.070
try out the APIs. And it's not limited to your

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.710
own APIs, you can use it for any Google API.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.810
So, all good stuff. But let's now talk about user authentication.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.490
Many applications require that a user is registered and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.080
signed in before using the application. We will also require

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.680
this for Conference Central, so let's look at how

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.110
we do that. It used to be the case that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.820
almost every application had to create their own user

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.140
management system. That would mean that you would have to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.600
write all the code from scratch in order for

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.150
your users to use your applications. Well, good for us.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.700
That is not needed anymore. With App Engine, you

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.800
can use third party authentication with Cloud Endpoints, such

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.260
as Google Plus sign-in. But also other ones can

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.450
be used. In Conference Central, we will require a Google

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.170
account for sign-in. So, how do we know that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.810
the user is signed into their Google account when they

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.830
use Conference Central? That is actually taking care of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.620
by Cloud Endpoints. A Cloud Endpoint's API method can optionally

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.320
take a user object as its first argument and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.640
if the user object is not null then the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.470
user is signed in, but if it's null then

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.380
we throw in exception which decline should receive and

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.540
redirect for sign in. Could it be more easy?

00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:36.590
Hm, you might say now. But what about security

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.760
and privacy? Well, that is all taken care of

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.850
by Google Sign in or a third party authentication provider.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.780
So this mechanism is the best of two worlds combined. A simple way

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.970
to add user authentication to your app, combined with the strong security and

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.410
privacy standards of Google, all right, that's enough talking, time for you do

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.240
some coding again by adding user

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.900
authentication to your Conference Central. Good luck.
