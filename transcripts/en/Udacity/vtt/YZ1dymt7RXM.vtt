00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.760
Let's look at this. If each parent randomly passes down one card,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.770
there are three combinations total. So if you notice, only one out

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.850
of the three have two aces. So only one of these combinations

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.100
would give you the abnormal heart condition. Let's go back to Matt.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.690
&gt;&gt; That's right. So even though the parents didn't show

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.040
the heart condition The child ended up with a trait

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.220
that neither parent showed. All because there are two

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.659
copies, and one version was hidden by the other.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.750
&gt;&gt; That's all very interesting, but you're missing out on

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.370
all the other traits that have an important environmental component.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.010
&gt;&gt; Okay, well Skinner, let's hear it.
