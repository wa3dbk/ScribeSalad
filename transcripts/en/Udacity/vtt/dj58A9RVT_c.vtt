00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.737
We know our equation is in slope intercept form, so the y intercept is b, or in

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:09.611
this case, negative 1. So, our line has to cross the y-axis at negative 1. That

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:14.541
would be this point here. We don't move horizontally on the x-axis, because the

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:19.398
x coordinate is 0. The y value is negative 1, so we move down. Nice work if you

00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:19.871
got it.
