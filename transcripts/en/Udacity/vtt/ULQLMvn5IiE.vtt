00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.558
To find the perimeter of our rectangle, we simply add up the sides around the

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.968
shape. So we have two l's, and two w's. You might have written this equation,

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:13.749
which also is correct. We want to combine the two l's, however, because they're

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.045
like terms. The same is true for the w's.
