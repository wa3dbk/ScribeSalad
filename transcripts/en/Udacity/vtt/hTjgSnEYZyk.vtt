00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.520
Another way of understanding
what is knowledge based AI,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.180
is to contrast it with the other
schools of thought in AI.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.310
We can think in terms of a spectrum.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.860
On one end of the spectrum, is acting.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.440
The other end of
the spectrum is thinking.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.340
As an example, when you're driving
a car, you're acting on the world.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.220
But when you are planning what route to
take, you're thinking about the world.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.850
There is a second dimension for

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.530
distinguishing between different
schools of thought of AI.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.650
At one end of the spectrum we can
think of AI agents that are optimal.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.860
At the other end of the spectrum,
we can think of air agents that act and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.540
think like humans.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.870
Humans are multifunctional,
they have very robust intelligence.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.940
That intelligence need not be optimal
relative to any one task, but

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.810
it's very general purpose, it works for
a very large number of tasks.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.850
Were as we can pick up here, agents on
the other side which are optimal for

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.690
a given task.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.430
Given these 2 axis we get 4 quadrants.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.050
Starting from the top left and going
counter clockwise, here are Agents that

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.550
think optimally, Agents that act
optimally, Agents that act like humans.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.840
And agents that think like humans.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640
In this particular course
in knowledged based AI,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.630
we're interested in agents
that think like humans.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.650
Let us take a few examples
to make sure that we

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.370
understand this four quadrants world.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.670
Here are some well known
computational techniques.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.780
Consider many machine
learning algorithms.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.473
These algorithms analyse
large amounts of data, and

00:01:35.473 --> 00:01:39.100
determine patterns of
the regularity of that data.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.600
Well I might think of them as
being in the top left quadrant.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.860
This is really doing thinking,
and they often are optimal, but

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.210
they're not necessarily human like.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.050
Airplane autopilots.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.530
They would go under acting optimally.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.760
They're suddenly acting in the world,
and you want them to act optimally.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.860
Improvisational robots that can perhaps
dance to the music that you play,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.860
they're acting, and they are behaving
like humans, dancing to some music.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.730
Semantic web, a new generation
of web technologies in which

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.200
the web understands the various pages,
and information on it.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.030
I might put that under
thinking like humans.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.970
They are thinking.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.310
Not acting in the world.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.930
And is much more like humans,
than, let's say,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.600
some of the other
computational techniques here.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.800
&gt;&gt; If you're interested in reading
some more about these projects,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.330
you can check out the course materials.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.260
Where we've provided some recent papers
on these different computational

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.320
techniques.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.270
There's a lot of cutting edge research
going on here at Georgia Tech and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.780
elsewhere, on these
different technologies.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.320
And if,
if you really are interested in this,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.650
this is something where we're
always looking for contributors.
