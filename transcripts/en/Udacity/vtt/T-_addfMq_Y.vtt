Wow, Chris, that's a really tough order of operations problem. But, if you got

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:09.869
the answer of negative 88, great job. The first thing that we want to do when we

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:15.083
look at an order of operation problem is to do the innermost parentheses first.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:19.967
I can see right here, there is the innermost parentheses of 6 minus 6 squared.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.775
So the first thing I'm going to do is calculate 6 minus 6 squared. 6 squared is

00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:30.124
36, so I have 6 minus 36. And of course, 6 minus 36 gives me a negative 30. It's

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:35.531
important when doing these order of operation problems that you write down all

00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:40.782
of the operations that you have not yet performed. So I'm going to copy down the

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:46.868
rest of the problem. So for this first step, I simply evaluated what was in the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.338
innermost parentheses, which 6 minus 36 is negative 30. Now I'm working in the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.275
brackets and I know that I have to do my powers or my exponents first. So

00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:05.250
negative 5 squared is negative 25 and 6 squared is 36. Now that I've evaluated

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:09.804
all my exponents or powers, the next thing I want to do is my multiplication.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:14.274
When I do my multiplication, it's a good idea to work from the left to the

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:19.004
right. I'm still working in these brackets. So, the two multiplications that I

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:24.213
have to do are negative 25 times negative 2, which gives me positive 50. I leave

00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:29.541
the minus 36 and the other multiplication that I have to do is negative 1 times

00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:34.459
negative 30 which gives me positive 30. Now that I have finished all the

00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:39.558
exponents, multiplication, and division within my brackets, now I can do my

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.875
addition and my subtraction. 50 minus 36 is 14, and then, I can add the 14 and

00:01:45.887 --> 00:01:53.187
the 30. 14 plus 30 gives me 44. The last thing I need to do is this last

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:59.644
operation, which is multiplication. Negative two times 44 gives me negative 88.
