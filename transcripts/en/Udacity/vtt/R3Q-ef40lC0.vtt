00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.340
Also what we did was we looked at different types of filtering mechanisms.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.250
So here I want to be able to take a box filter.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.940
In this one I'm showing a 21 by 21 box filter with uniform values and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.900
we can apply that to smoothing of an image.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.420
If you look at this part of the image here.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.850
And you sense, basically, you see a flat, gray kernel.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.110
And, if you look at it in a height map that we've looked at it basically it's

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.850
got a fixed value just like this.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.310
And that basically is now our average or a box filter.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.320
Let's look at how we would apply a box filter to an original image like this,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.520
the pepper's image.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.678
Again, it's the flat kernel.

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:41.345
When applied you get a blurry image.

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:43.372
This is a 21 by 21 kernel.

00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:47.386
The linear combination of the weights here with the linear,

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:53.180
with the constant values of the box here, result in a rather blurry image.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.680
Notice again, this is a flat kernel or a box filter.
