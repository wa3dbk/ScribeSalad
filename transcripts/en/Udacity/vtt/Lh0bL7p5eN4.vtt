Before I get started I want you to smile. Are you smiling? Okay, keep smiling.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.194
Many researchers have found the benefits of the facial feedback effect. For

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:12.314
example, one group of researchers that did an experiment similar to the one we

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:15.386
just did with the pen in making people smile, found that participants who had

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:20.647
the pen in their teeth forcing them to smile. Found a cartoon to be more

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:25.122
amusing, than participants who are frowning. I find this research to truly be

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:29.036
amazing, and can actually benefit you in your everyday life. Because our face

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:33.154
is so much more than just a tool to express emotion. It can actually encourage

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:38.273
and promote feelings. For example, one group of researchers found that patients

00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:42.035
reported feeling better after receiving Botox injections in their eyebrow to

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:47.115
paralyze the frowning muscles. After only two months, nine out of ten patients

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:51.859
said that they were no longer depressed and felt better. This stuff is truly

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:52.700
amazing.
