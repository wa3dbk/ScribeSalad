00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.780
So let's talk about some problems
of centralized main memory and

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.480
why we may want to do something else.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.010
As we have seen in the previous quiz,
memory size is a problem.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.880
We need a large memory, and

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.310
because it's all one big memory,
that one memory will be slow and,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.730
because of its large size, relatively
far away from all of the cores.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.170
We will also have the problem
of memory bandwidth.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.040
Because misses from all
cores go to the one memory.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.620
So the requests from all of
the cores create contention for

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.540
memory bandwidth because our big, slow
memory will have a limited bandwidth.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.870
And what that does is it prevents,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.200
really, additional cores from
benefiting our performance.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.800
Because all of the accesses
are really serializing

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.660
in the queue waiting for memory.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.740
So if we add more cores,
that just makes every core's accesses

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.660
even slower because they have
to wait for memory even longer.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.600
So we don't really get
a performance advantage.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.310
So centralized main memory because
of this problems works well only for

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.590
relatively small machines, with
something like 2, 4, 8, maybe 16 cores.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.710
Beyond this, we saturate
the memory bandwidth and also

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.970
our memory needs to know the too big and
too slow if we keep it centralized.
