00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.000
Now we get to the final part of the lesson.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.810
And in this part I want to talk about well known,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.230
ineffective development practices. These practices, when followed, tend to lead

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.245
to predictably bad results. So let's look at some examples of

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:17.130
these classic mistakes. And we're going to start with mistakes

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.660
involving people. And notice that there is a long list. So

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.100
I'm going to discuss just a few of those mistakes.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.215
And I'm going to point you to more information on this

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.550
topic in the class notes. And some of these mistakes are

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.020
actually kind of entertaining. So I'll recommend that you look at

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.210
the class notes and go in more depth in this list.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.550
So the first people mistake I want to mention is the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.945
one that I define, heroics. And this refers to too much

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:43.480
emphasis on can do attitudes, so this idea that one person

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.330
by himself or by herself can do everything and can make

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.422
the difference in the whole project. And unfortunately, this encourages extreme

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:53.950
risk taking and discourages cooperation, which is plain bad for

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.610
the project. For example, it might force people not to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.600
report schedule slips. It might force people to take on

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.210
on too much responsibility. And normally, and I saw it

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.600
happen many times, the final result is a failure. So

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.410
what you want when you're developing a larger project, is

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.710
actually to apply soft engineering principles. Have teams, have team

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.580
work, and have cooperation among the different team members, without pointing

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.830
too much on single individuals. Another classic mistake

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.140
is to not create the right working environment. We

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.900
all like to work in nice environments. And there

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.790
is strong evidence that the working environments can play

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.670
a big role in productivity. There is evidence

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.280
that productivity increases when the workplace is nice, quiet,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.950
warm, and welcoming. Finally, some of the most important

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.480
people relating mistakes are due to poor people management.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.540
For example, lack of leaderships, or leadership that is

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.920
exercised using the wrong means in the wrong way, which

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.280
can lead to very unhappy personnel and therefore, low

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.190
productivity, or even people leaving teams. Another classic example of

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.370
poor management is adding people to a project that

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.600
is behind schedule, which never works. Why it doesn't work?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.440
Because these new people need to be brought up to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.520
speed, and that causes further delays rather than improving the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.280
situation with the project schedule.
