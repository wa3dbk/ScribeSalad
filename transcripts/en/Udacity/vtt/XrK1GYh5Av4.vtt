00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.504
To start solving this inequality, let's clear our groupings by distributing. I

00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:08.363
want to distribute this negative 2 and this positive 2. I'm showing my

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:12.768
distribution in this step here, being really careful with my negative 3. It's

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.074
negative 3 times negative 1. I'm going to combine like terms on each side of the

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:22.269
inequality. I have 5 plus 3, which gives me 8, and 6 plus 1, which gives me 7. I

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:27.475
bring down the negative 3m, and the 2m. I add 3m to both sides to keep my

00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:33.345
variable positive. A positive 5m and no more M's on the left. Next, I subtract 7

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:39.240
from both sides to isolate the 5m. Finally, I divide by 5 on both sides to get 1

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:44.903
5th is less than or equal to M. That's the same thing as M being greater than or

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:49.893
equal to 1 5th M is greater than or equal to 1 5th, so that must be answer

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:50.524
choice A.
