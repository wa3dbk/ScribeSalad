00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.830
Here's our last practice problem on completing the square. Notice that here we

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.650
don't have an a value of 1. We have an a value of 3. So, what do you think you

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.352
could do to solve here? Try taking an additional step here first and then try

00:00:12.352 --> 00:00:17.260
completing the square. When you think you have it, write your answer here.
