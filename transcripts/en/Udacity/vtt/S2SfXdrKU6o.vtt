00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
We're going to assume that we have

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
what we know is a random oracle,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which is an ideal cryptographic hash function.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And this random oracle assumption means that we can have

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
an ideal cryptographic hash function

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that match any input to H with a uniform distribution.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And, an attacker trying to find collisions

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
can do no better than a brute force search on the size of H.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, that's what we will assume we have.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Before we go forward with that assumption,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want to ask a quiz--whether random oracles actually exist.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The answers are: Yes, they do, and we know of one;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
maybe they exist but we don't know of one yet;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or, no, it's impossible to actually build a random log.
