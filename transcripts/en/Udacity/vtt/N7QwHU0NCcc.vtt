00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.904
Let's start thinking back to the different ways that we transformed parabolas

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.498
before. And then maybe we'll be able to generalize this to work with other

00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:11.618
functions. As we've seen so many times before, here's the graph of f of x

00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:15.844
equals x squared. What would happen to our graph though, if we changed the

00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:20.522
equation? For example, let's say I want to change it to f of x equals x squared

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:25.408
minus 2. What direction would the graph shift in? Up, down, left, or right, and

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.170
by how many units?
