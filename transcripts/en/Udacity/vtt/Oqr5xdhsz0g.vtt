00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.980
So, while adding these two buttons, some students had trouble while playing and

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.270
stopping audio.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.500
I want to address those concerns in this video.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.740
Now, here in my Play Sounds View Controller, I have actions for

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.379
play slow audio, play fast audio, and stop audio.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.280
I'm going to run this project and see if it works.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.740
Here, I will play the move quote slowly, and then fast, and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.280
then I will stop all audio.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.762
Take a listen [SOUND].

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:36.485
Now you may have noticed that when I press any one of these two buttons while

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:40.389
the audio is already playing, the playback starts not from the beginning but

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:43.750
from when I actually pressed any one of these two buttons.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.930
You can keep that functionality, if you'd like.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.540
Although, if you want to start the audio from the beginning.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.050
You can use this property called currentTime and set it to 0.0.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.530
Let me do that in both slow and fast.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.490
Okay, let me run this project one more time.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Now, this time the audio will start from the beginning.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.480
&gt;&gt; My mom always said.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.010
My momma always said, life was like a box of chocolates.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.900
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.910
Now one final thing to notice here is that the code for

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.250
both the slow and the fast actions is looking really similar to each other.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.730
Here is an opportunity for you to put the common code in a new function.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.620
And then call that new function from both the Play Slow Audio and

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.530
the Play Fast Audio actions.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.530
All right, if you have any more questions about how to make these two

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.320
buttons work, ask those questions in the discussion forum, we are here to help
