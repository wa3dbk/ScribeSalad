00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Big O notation is very useful because we can use it to concentrate

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.720
just on the fastest growing part of the function and even without all the involved constants.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.150
I now want to show you a few examples to make this more concrete.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.640
So 3n+1 for example would be contained in O(n) because we do not care about the +1

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.190
and 3n grows at the same rate.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.670
It does grow at least as fast as n.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:36.669
The function 18n²-50 would be contained in O(n²) because again n² here is the fastest growing term.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:39.320
We do not care the minus 50 and we don't care about the constants.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:50.710
Now very similarly here, if you have 2ⁿ+30n⁶+123 that would be in O(2ⁿ).

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.709
We do not care about the constant and those two terms here, they both depend on n but

00:00:55.709 --> 00:01:06.910
2ⁿ outgrows the 30n⁶ and since we add those two terms here, 2ⁿ is really just the fastest growing part.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:15.600
Now if we don't add those two parts here but for example we multiply 2ⁿ&lt;i&gt;n²,&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.600
we need to include that into the O notation because just having 2ⁿ

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.670
that grows slower than 2ⁿ&lt;i&gt;n².&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:36.820
We just have 2ⁿ here. That statement would not be true because 2ⁿ grows slower than 2ⁿ &lt;i&gt;n² .&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:47.770
So what about a statement like 3n+1 is contained in O of n² because n² really grows at least as fast as n.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.660
This one must also be true and it is true the only thing it would unusual to write this

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.700
because usually we're trying to state this bound here as tight as possible.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Similar down here, you could also say that 18n² -50 is contained in O of to the n³

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.560
but again this would be unusual to write because if we have a tighter bound that we can state,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.690
we would state this part over here.

00:02:16.690 --> 99:59:59.000
Enough with the examples, I'm going to let you figure out the rest as our next quiz.
