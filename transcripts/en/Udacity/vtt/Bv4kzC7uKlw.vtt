00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.172
Now that Grant's has such great ideas from the glasses expo about how to run his

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.268
business, and how to make all of his different products better, he's ready to

00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:12.532
get his glasses wipers, and nozzles onto the market. That means that it's time

00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:16.721
to talk about profit again. A while ago, Grant picked out some prices for his

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:21.143
wipers and his nozzles, but he wants to use the algebra skills we've taught him,

00:00:21.143 --> 00:00:25.526
to check out if these really are the best choices he can make. So let's revisit

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:29.877
the idea of profit for a moment. If profit, which we'll call p, is equal to the

00:00:29.877 --> 00:00:34.093
money that Grant earns, minus the money that he spends, and if we call money

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:38.649
spent m, then can you write an equation for profit, involving just single letter

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.138
variables? Assume that the money that they earned is only coming from wipers,

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:47.347
and that the number of wiper sets sold is equal to n, and the price per wiper

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.385
set is equal to c.
