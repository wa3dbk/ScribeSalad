One last thing before we get started. I want to strongly caution you against

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:08.727
diagnosing yourself or others with a mental disorder. It's very common to see

00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:13.040
portions of yourself when learning this material. And people become more

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.786

strongly urge you to seek a licensed health care professional if you are

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:24.120
concerned. We've actually provided a document for you to help you pick a

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.590
