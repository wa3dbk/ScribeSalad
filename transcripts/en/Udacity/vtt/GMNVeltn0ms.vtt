00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is no.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's look at our browser.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
When I click submit here, the URL updates just like it did before,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with--this time the q parameter equals computer in our URL.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, what's happening here when we hit enter and press submit

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is that we're actually submitting the form.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And by default, the form submits to itself,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which--while is neat for playing around in our browser--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and--you know--editing the URL--isn't so handy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So--let's talk about how we can make this form submit to someplace else.
