00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can see a program as a succession of program states.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Each program states consists of several variables with values.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
As a program executes, it processes these states and transforms them into a new states.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For instance, by reading variables and writing variables. This is the normal mode of operation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, however, since in the beginning, we have a normal input and in the end we have a failure,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
there must be a defect somewhere in our program that actually causes the problem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So let me assume that this statement we're executing here actually has a defect.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What happens is that now, when executed, it introduces

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
an error in the program state which we call an infection.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This infection is now being propagated possibly to other state

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and eventually becomes visible as a failure towards the user.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What we get in here is actually an entire cause-effect chain.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You see, these failures, which is an infection, is caused by earlier infections

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and if we are at a state where the infection has no further origin, that is, the input state is the same,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and the output is infected, and we know the statement that was executed at this precise moment

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which caused this transition from the same state to infected state,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
this is the statement which caused the infection, this is the statement which has the defect.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
When we're debugging now, we need to identify this cause-effect chain

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
not only do we need to identify but we also need to break the cause-effect chain.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If we can break this cause-effect chain from defect to failure, then we're done with debugging.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So all of this looks very simple, however, in real life, it's much more complicated than that.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
To start with, not every defect automatically causes a failure.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It may well be that the defect causes an infection which later simply is not

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
propagated as a real life infection just as well.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So the infection is not propagated and never ever becomes visible to the user.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It may not even cause a failure at all or the statement with the defect may not even be executed

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
or only under very specific circumstances may actually cause an infection and later a failure.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is the problem of testing. You can execute a program again and again,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
never have a failure and still have a defect in there, however, if a program fails,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that is if we actually see a failure, then we can always trace it back to the defect that causes it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So if there's a failure, we can always fix it by following back the cause-effect chain.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But then the next problem is: these states are huge.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So over here we have 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 12 variables. Cute.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
In reality, we have 10,000 of such variables and not only do we have 10,000 of such variables,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we also have 10,000 of steps between defect and failure.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So tracing back the cause-effect chain can be much,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
much more complicated that it is in this simple picture.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The longer the cause-effect chain, that is the longer the time we have to cover,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the more states we have to cover, the harder is to debug it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And also, the larger the state, the more we have to search for an infection.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Again, this makes debugging harder and harder.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's like finding a needle in a haystack except that the haystack

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
sometimes is larger than any haystack you'll ever find on earth.
