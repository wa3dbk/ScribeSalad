00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.844
Since we're looking for roots, once again we set y equal to zero. Which is just

00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:07.621
going to leave a 10, on the left side of the equation, and change nothing about

00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:11.433
the right side. Now we need to move toward getting x by itself. You can notice

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.118
that I actually didn't use the quadratic formula, in solving this equation.

00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:19.588
Instead, I just undid all the operations that had been performed on x on the

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:24.184
right side of the equation. Eventually this led me to the answer of x equals 3

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:28.714
plus or minus i times the square root of 5. Now one thing to note about the way

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:33.420
that I've written this answer. You'll see that I wrote i in front of the radical

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.596
sign, whereas we'd normally write in the form a plus bi, where the real

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:42.537
coefficient of the imaginary portion comes in front of the number i. However, to

00:00:42.537 --> 00:00:47.217
avoid confusion as to whether or not the i belongs under the radical sign, it's

00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:51.988
often written in front of the square root sign instead. This is similar to if we

00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:56.502
had something like 3 times the root of five, writing the number this way is

00:00:56.502 --> 00:01:01.282
usually the convention. Rather than this way, just to make perfectly clear what

00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:05.396
doesn't belong under the radical sign. Either way though, with the i as the

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:09.488
first factor, or the i coming after the square root of 5, is mathematically

00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:10.085
correct.
