00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.654
The two other points on this parabola are negative 1 and negative 5 and

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:10.420
positive 1 comma 5. Good thinking if you checked those 2. What's so different

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.470
now is that our graph is going to open downward since we have a negative value

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.662
in front of the x squared. To find our basic shape, we'll start at 0, 0, the

00:00:19.662 --> 00:00:26.502
vertex. Next we'll move one unit left and five units down. This gives us our

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:31.666
first point of negative 1, negative 5. Remember, the a value will always tell

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:36.740
us how many units to move up or down when our parabola is in the form y equals.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.402
And since our parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, we can also go one unit

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:47.414
to the right, and five units down. This gives us our other point of 1 comma

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:52.156
negative 5. One of the key takeaways from this exercise is that a parabola in

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:58.164
the form y equals will always open upward, or it will open downward. If the a

00:00:58.164 --> 00:01:02.617
value is positive, like in these three, we know the parabola opens upward. But

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:06.713
if the a value is negative, like in these two graphs, we know the parabola will

00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:08.770
open downward.
