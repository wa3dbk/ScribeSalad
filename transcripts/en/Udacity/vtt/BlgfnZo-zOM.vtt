00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.176
It's easiest to complete the square when solving a quadratic equation, if this

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:09.532
quadratic is not factorable and if a is equal to 1 and b is even. We want b to

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:13.128
be even because eventually we're going to add b over 2 squared to both sides of

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:17.954
the equation. If b is even, then we know that this b over 2 squared ends up

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:23.499
being an integer rather than a fraction. So, once we know a equals 1 and b is

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.026
even. We can move this constant term to the other side of the equation. This

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:32.828
will put the equation in this form. Next, we add b over 2 squared to both sides

00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:37.400
of our equation. This allows us to rewrite the left side as a perfect square.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.308
And then we can continue solving using our square root method. When solving the

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.380
problems throughout this lesson. Use these steps as a guide to help you

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.630
complete the square. Try solving this first practice problem. Move this

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.466
negative 6 to the other side, and then complete the square and solve for x. Be

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:57.710
sure you enter your answer using the plus or minus symbol. Good luck.
