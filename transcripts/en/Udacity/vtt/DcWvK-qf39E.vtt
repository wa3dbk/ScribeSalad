00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.040
Now it's time for
you to update your weather app.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Using the cache then network strategy,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.430
I want you first to modify the get
forecast method in your app.js file

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.360
to get data from the cache and
kick off a request to the weather API.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.610
Then, update the service worker to
check the URL being requested, and

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.080
if it's a request to the weather API,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.840
cache the response in the data
cache before returning it.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.160
Make sure you use
progressive techniques here.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.120
Using feature detection to
determine if the cache's object

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.810
is available in the global scope.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.460
And makes sure that if the network
returns before the cache,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.210
the cache doesn't clobber
the network data.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.990
When you've completed this step,
your app should now work offline.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.040
Try loading the app then
turn off your network and

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.460
your web server to see if it does.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.690
You can compare your app to the link
in the instructor notes below

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.420
to make sure it works exactly the same.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.190
And don't forget to try your
app in multiple browsers.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.870
How does it work in Firefox?

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.520
Safari?

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.940
Etc.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.780
If you try and load this in a browser
that doesn't support service workers,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.970
it may not work offline, but
it should work just fine when online.
