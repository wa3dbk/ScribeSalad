00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.850
The final structural type of UML diagram that I'd

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.380
like to mention is the Profile Diagram. But this requires taking a step back.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.560
UML itself is a language, that has various pieces to it,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.900
such as classes and associations and so on. Those pieces.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.592
Essentially provide a, describe a system and

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:30.780
therefore you could have a UML description of UML.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.940
That UML description or UML is called the UML meta model and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.440
in fact you can have, a UML class model diagram of a UML meta model.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.900
Even, more abstract is the fact that you,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.110
as a user, a designer, can extend the UML middle model.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.708
You can add new kinds of icons. You can give, special labels.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:04.340
To particular elements in the model. You do that extension in what's called

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.230
a UML profile. And there's a UML Profile Diagram in which you can convey it
