00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.390
In this lesson we're
going to look at optimizers.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.160
Optimizers sound scary, but
they're really cool and really fun.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.500
I'm going to show you all kinds of neat
things you can do with optimizers.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.950
What is an optimizer?

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.610
An optimizer is an algorithm that
can do the following things.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.340
Optimizers can be used to find
minimum values for functions.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.932
So say you have a function
like f(x)=x2+x3+5 or

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:38.450
something like that,
an optimizer can find.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.530
For what value of x is this
overall function minimized?

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.410
Another thing that optimizers can
do is find the parameters for

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.700
parameterized models from data.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.900
So we might have some data
from some experiment, and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.060
we can use optimizers to find
a polynomial fit to that data.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.400
And that is actually one thing we
are going to learn in this lesson.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.660
Finally, we can use an optimizer

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.540
to refine allocations to
stocks in portfolios.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.570
What does that mean?

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.530
Well, that means for instance,
you can decide what percentage of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.320
funds should be allocated to
each stock using an optimizer.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.060
How do we use an optimizer?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.950
It's really just as simple
as three key steps.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.410
First thing you need to do is define
a function that you want to minimize.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.780
As an example you might
use something like f of x

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.510
is equal to x square plus point five.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.930
You define that in Python and then the
minimizer will call this function many,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.310
many times as it tries to
find the minimum values for

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.120
x that causes this function
overall to be smallest.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.580
You also need to start
with an initial guess for

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.670
x that you think might be close
to the solution to the problem.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.560
If you don't really know,
then you can choose a random value or

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.400
just some standard value.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.750
But then the optimizer starts
with that guess and it repeatedly

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.650
calls a function, tests different
values, and narrows in on the solution.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.084
Finally, you call the optimizer
with these parameters and

00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:29.496
stand back while it searches for
the minimum.
