00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.091
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A few minutes ago, I showed you the graph of y equals negative 1 8th times x

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.355
minus 4 times x minus 24. Now this time I've graphed a graph that looks pretty

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.544
similar to that. I just changed this to a 28 instead. Anyway I'd like you to

00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:17.003
inspect this graph that we have now. Now while your'e looking at this graph, I'd

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:21.140
like you to think back to the first parabola we dealt with in this lesson. Y

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.312
equals negative x squared over 8, plus 4 x, X minus 14. Remember, this was the

00:00:25.312 --> 00:00:29.407
curve that we were using to describe how the ball would fly out of the slingshot

00:00:29.407 --> 00:00:33.565
and go through the hoop at Grant's display booth. For this quadratic equation,

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:37.719
we found it's y-intercept, it's x-intercepts and it's maximum, as these points

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.851
right here. Take a second and compare these points to this graph, and then think

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:46.182
about how these equations might be connected. Here are a few different options

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:50.163
for how these two equations might be connected to one another. And I'd like you

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:54.136
to pick all of the ones that apply. Is there no connection between them at all?

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:58.011
Do their graphs share a few points? Do their graphs go through all of the same

00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.827
point? Do they graph the same curve? Or are the equations equivalent to one

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:02.320
another?
