00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
The first one, 4n²-300n+12 € O(n²) because n² is the fastest growing term.  So it's correct.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.830
And it's also the best possible bound because we have n² here as the fastest growing term,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.630
which is exactly the same that we wrote here.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.790
The second one is also correct because n³ grows faster than n², but it's not the best possible bound

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.380
we can give because we already found out that n² is the best possible bound that we can give.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:38.790
Now down here 3ⁿ+5n²-3ⁿ grows much faster than n² so this is not true and of course it cannot be the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.350
best possible bound if it's not a correct bound at all.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.540
In the next one, 3ⁿ is the fastest growing term and this is exactly what we're setting on the right here

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.370
so it's correct and it's also the best possible bound that we can give.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.920
The next one, again, the bound is correct.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.000
This is similar to here when we compared n³ to n²

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.430
so 4ⁿ grows much faster than 3ⁿ, but again, it's not the best possible bound

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.740
because we already know that 3ⁿ is the best possible bound that we can give.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.830
This one down here is similar to one of the examples that I just showed you,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.590
so we can ignore the constant here and 2ⁿ(n²) grows faster than 2ⁿ so this is not correct.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.300
And since it's not correct, it cannot be the best possible bound.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:30.990
Now, this one down here is probably a little bit tricky because 2.1ⁿ indeed grows faster than

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.750
2ⁿ(n²) so if you plot those two functions

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:43.910
you can see that 2.1ⁿ will outgrow this part here, 2ⁿ(n²), so it is a correct bound

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.990
but it is not the best possible one

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.550
because the best possible one would be 2ⁿ(n²) and not 2.1ⁿ, which grows much faster.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.980
So, as you can see, O notation is simply about looking at which part of the function grows

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.960
the fastest and then it's a very convenient way of actually describing the growth of that function while

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.770
ignoring details that are a bit distracting and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.480
not necessary for the analysis that we are going to do in this course.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, there's one final note I should make.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.970
Some people instead of writing f(n) € O(g(n)) also write f(n) = O(g(n)) and sometimes but this is

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.500
not very common people will also write it as if it were a subset.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.400
So they would use the symbol here and say subset contained in O(g(n)).

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.700
This here is probably the most correct way to state it because O(g(n)) is actually

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.350
a set of functions if you were to consider it mathematically.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.400
But this one appear = O(g(n)) is also a very common one that you can also find in many

00:02:53.400 --> 99:59:59.000
scientific papers and even teaching books.
