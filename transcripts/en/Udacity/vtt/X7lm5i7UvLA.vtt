00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.870
Now that we have seen how the ROB based processor is supposed to work,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.060
let's do a ROB quiz. This is actually going to be a series of quizzes.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.790
We will have this state of the processor, with these instructions.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.490
Note that the add now takes 1 cycle, multiplication 3 cycles, and

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.510
divide takes 10 cycles and the assumptions about dispatching and execution and

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.730
so on are the same as before. So, basically, even instruction captures results

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.700
in one cycle, then it can dispatch in that cycle and begin executing in

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.840
the next cycle, or if the instruction is issued in one cycle and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.670
it has operands ready to go. Then it can dispatch in that same cycle so

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.210
that it begins executing in the very next cycle.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.410
But the last cycle of execution will complete before we broadcast the results.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.240
So, if an add begins executing in some cycle X, because it takes one cycle to

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.560
do that, it's going to be able to broadcast the result in cycle X plus 1.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.370
The initial value of the registers are these. The cycle is one.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.540
Obviously, nothing will happen except for an issuing of an instruction. So

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.200
the first question for you is, we will try to issue this instruction, What is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.670
going to be the content of the RAT entry for R2? So put the value here.
