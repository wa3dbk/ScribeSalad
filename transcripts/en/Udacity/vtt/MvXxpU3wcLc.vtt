[Norvig] And before I do generator expressions, we're going to do list comprehensions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You've seen them before.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We saw in Unit 1 we said that we could get the list of suits by saying

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
[s for r, s in cards].

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so the format here is we have the individual term of the list comprehension

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and here we have a for clause.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And in general, we're going to have 1 for clause at least

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and then, optionally, we could have more here, either for or if clauses.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And that's what a list comprehension looks like in general.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, what does the list comprehension mean?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This expression is similar to saying we're going to write out a loop where we say

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the result starts as the empty list,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
then we take the for part and then we take the term and append that into the result.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And then when we're all done, result will hold the value of this expression.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now I'm going to show you a more complex list comprehension.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Say we wanted the list of suits for all our face cards.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Then we could say s for r, s in cards if the rank of the cards is, say,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in jack, queen, king.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I don't know why you'd want that, but there's a possibility.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So I've got the term I'm building up, I've got 1 for loop controlling it,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and now I've got an if statement, and that's as if we had written this code

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
if we had inserted inside the for loop an if statement

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and then only done the appending of the term s if the if statement is true.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And in general, we can have any number of for statements, if statements,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
more for statements, more if statements.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We can keep on adding those for clauses and if clauses

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and intermingling them in any order we want,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as long as the for clause comes first.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And we can have that 1 big list comprehension, and that corresponds to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
putting in more fors and ifs here in this loop.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The whole thing is read left to right except for the term.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So the way to read a list comprehension is to say

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm going to ignore the first part for now,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and then I think of it as saying it's a bunch of nested statements--

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
for statements, if statements, for statements.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
They all get nested deeper and deeper.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Then when I get to the end, the very last clause, now I'm appending together the term,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
so now read the term.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And that's why it's okay that term here looks like it's referencing a variable s

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that hasn't been defined yet.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That's okay because s has been defined here.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And it looks like it's used before it's defined, but that's not the case,

00:02:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because when it's actually used is right down here at the end.
