00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
One argument you might make against undecidability and the importance of saying

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.330
whether a problem is undecidable, is that every computer is actually finite.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.330
It has a finite amount of state.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.930
It can run for a finite length of time.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.740
Therefore we can determine whether a program halts or not simply by letting it run

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.260
either until it terminates or it arrives at a state where it has already been.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.650
By state I mean the memory in the computer is exactly the same,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.470
and we are executing the same line of code as we were the previous time around.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.800
Because if both of those things are true we are going to loop back around again

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.820
and have the same memory and line of code executing,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.960
and again, and again.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260
Then we'll know if it will terminate or not.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.850
One of the problems with this is that today's computers have a whole lot of memory.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.390
So why don't we try it with something a little bit smaller?

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.490
Let's try it with a smaller computer.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.360
A computer that only has a single kilobyte of total memory.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.230
This is a ridiculously small amount of memory for this day and age.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.460
It's really kind of a joke. You can't even fit the Udacity logo in this amount of memory.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.010
Now remember, a kilobyte is a 1,000 bytes, and a byte has 8 bits in it,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.580
which can each be set to either 0 or 1.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.130
Let's say that this computer can take 10 billion steps in a single second.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.750
What I'd like to know is if we did this, and we wanted to know if a program that we were

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.630
running on this computer would terminate, how many years could it potentially take us

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.420
to decide if our given program terminates?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.760
I'd like your answer in the exponent for 10 to the---however many numbers of years.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:44.000
If you'd like a little bit of a hint, the age of the universe is estimated at about 14 billion

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.740
or 10 to the 10th years.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.510
Your answer should be substantially larger than that.

00:01:50.510 --> 99:59:59.000
Go ahead and enter the exponent in here.
