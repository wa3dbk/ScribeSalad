00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.669
This expression is equal to the log of base b of 5. Great thinking if you got

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.176
this answer. Now, to start, I think it's best to think about this as two

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:15.996
logarithms of base b of 5. If I write this line all out. I see I have log base

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:22.961
b of 2 plus log base b of 5. Plus log base b of 5, minus log base b of 10. And

00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:27.299
notice that there are two log base b's of 5 here. Now I'm ready to apply my

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:31.260
properties of logarithms. I know when I add two logarithms together that have

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.913
the same base, I can really just multiply these numbers together. So have log

00:00:36.913 --> 00:00:41.850
base b of two times five. I'm going to do this one more time. I have one more

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.474
addition here, so I can multiply these number times these numbers. So we have

00:00:47.474 --> 00:00:54.027
log base b of 2 times 5 times 5, minus log base b of 10. Now when we subtract

00:00:54.027 --> 00:00:59.484
logarithms, we take this number and divide it by this number. So we'll have log

00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:05.465
base b of 2 times 5 times 5 divided by 10. Now, you might be wondering why I

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:09.265
didn't go ahead and multiply these numbers. And it's because I knew that I

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:13.352
would have to simplify in the end. So I can see that 2 times 5 times equals 10,

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:18.640
and that reduces with another ten in the denominator. These simplify to one.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.623
And this is how we get our final result of log base b of 5.
