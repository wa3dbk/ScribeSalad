00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.060
In your first programming class, computer memory may have been

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.040
explained to you with a picture that looks something like this.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.330
We have the CPU, where your instructions get executed, and these

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.480
instructions may read or write to either main Memory, or to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.300
Disk. Main memory is Fast, and you can access any element

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.680
in the same amount of time. That's what we mean by

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.330
Random Access. And it is Temporary in the sense that when

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.840
the program exits or if power is lost, all the information

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.240
stored in it disappears. The hard disk, by contrast, is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.770
slow. It uses Sequential Access since you have to actually

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.210
spin the disk to the right place. And what you

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.060
write to the disk is permanent. It will still be there

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.020
when the program exits or if power is lost. In

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.520
this lecture, we're going to refine this picture in two ways. First,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.330
we'll look at Cache Systems, which allow the CPU to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.150
access the same information that is in main memory, only faster.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.940
Understanding how cache systems work will help you optimize your

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.850
code when you need to. Second, we will explain the Virtual

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.278
Memory system. As you write your application and compiler compiles it

00:01:00.278 --> 00:01:03.140
to generate addresses for all your variables and your code, you

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.684
don't have to worry about other programs and what memory

00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:09.235
addresses they might be using. In fact there's often an illusion

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.754
that having even more main memory then exists in the system,

00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:16.284
and that your application has them all to yourself. W'll see

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.579
how the operating system maintains this abstraction

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.940
to the virtual memory system. The details are

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.210
essential to understanding operating systems optimizations. And how

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.980
the need to share resources affects program performance.
