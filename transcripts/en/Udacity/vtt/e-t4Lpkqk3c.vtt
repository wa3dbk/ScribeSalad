00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.140
Some of these are shown in this
small example of an HL7 RIM example.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.590
As you can see, each of these is
further specified in great detail, but

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.848
finding the explanations can be tedious.

00:00:12.848 --> 00:00:18.500
The FHIR, F-H-I-R,
Resources site is the best

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.550
source of explanations I'm aware of,
but it is intentionally not complete.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.880
To get a feel for this,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.100
let's focus on the special arrangements
code in the patient encounter box.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.830
We see here that this is
a leaf of the act box.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.970
Meaning, it's a particular example or
instance.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.650
I picked it because most of
the detailed names are self evident so

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.708
you can easily see the level
of detail that is specified.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:50.280
D set, indicates this is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.470
a discreet set of possible values and in
fact, although they're not shown here.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.950
These are wheel for wheelchair.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.400
S-T-R-E-T for stretcher.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.180
I-N-T for interpreter.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.680
A-T-T for attendant and
D-O-G for guide dog.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.230
All examples of things that
would be specially arranged for

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.770
were a patient to arrive at a hospital.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.860
Here's another detailed example where
SBADM means substance administration.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.190
And RQO means request.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.380
Typically part of a medication
order by a physician.
