00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.240
The last thing I'm going to
talk about is custom operators.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.939
Custom operators allow us to define
completely new operators that we can use

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:07.470
in our code.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.170
To create a new operator,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.300
you need to specify what kind
of operator it is first.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.610
Is it a prefix operator, an infix
operator, or a postfix operator?

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.628
So you specify the type of operator,
operator, and

00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:24.170
then the symbol you want to use for
the operator.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.930
So, we'll use the bank
symbol in this case.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.120
So now that we know what the symbol is
for this operator, we need to define

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.660
a function that tells the compiler
what kind of operand it accepts, and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.250
what it returns.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.810
The reason I'm using the word
operand instead of parameter is,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.500
that's just conventional when
we're talking about operators.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.560
The arguments that they accept
are referred to as operands.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.720
This one keeps things simple, and
it takes a string operand, and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.360
it returns a string.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.220
Then what the operator actually does,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.450
is add the dis prefix to
whatever the word operand was.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.220
And now we can use this
operator right in our code,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.709
and we can see that we get disassociate,
and disconnect, and disappear.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.030
Now let's look at an infix operator.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.440
For an infix operator we need to define
its associativity and precedence, and so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.440
it's a little bit different
than the prefix operator.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.291
Here we've assigned this to left
associative and it's precedence to 155.

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:24.902
And then the rest of the operator
definition continues like we saw.

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:29.340
For this operator, we're going to take
two operands, which are integers, and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.828
then return another Int.

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:34.108
I'm going to give you a second to see if
you can figure out what this operator is

00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:35.370
actually doing.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.479
So go ahead, take a second and
see if you can figure it out.

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:47.470
If you guessed exponentiation, or
the exponent, then you got it right.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.890
So, for this first example we have here,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.910
we're raising 5 to the second power and
this gives us a result of 25.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.194
And then we take and chain it together,
so this is actually computing 25.

00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:02.510
I could just write 25.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.228
And then it's raising that to
the second power and giving us 625.

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:10.919
Now I'll skip on down to the bottom for
our postfix example.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.810
This definition's similar to the prefix
example and it takes one operand and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.350
returns a result.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.710
In this case, we're taking an Int and
we're returning a Double.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.374
So you'll notice that it doesn't have
to be the case that the types of

00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:25.346
the operands match the return type.

00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:27.250
And this operator's pretty slick.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.030
It converts an integer
followed by a percent sign

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.500
into its decimal representation.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.290
Now that's pretty cool.
