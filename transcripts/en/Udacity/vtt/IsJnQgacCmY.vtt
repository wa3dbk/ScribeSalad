00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.560
Now that we understand the distributed object model

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.160
of Java and how to build services using

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.940
the distributed Java object model and publish it

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.340
and make it accessible to the clients. let's look

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.880
at how the RMI is actually implemented? At

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.770
the core of the RMI implementation is this layer

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.820
called Remote Reference Layer, RRL. And that's the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.470
place where a lot of magic happens. The client

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.940
site stub, is going to initiate a

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.490
remote method invocation call using this Remote

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.070
Reference Layer, and all of the magic

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.330
with respect to marshaling the arguments. In

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.330
order to send it over the network and so on is handled entirely by

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.370
this Remote Reference Layer. And similarly when

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.960
the result comes back unmarshaling the results

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.700
into the data structures, that the client understands is once

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.060
again accomplished using this RRL layer. On the server side. The

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.310
skeleton that exists is therefore unmarshaling the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.380
arguments that comes from the client. And

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.190
in order to unmarshal the argument, the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.080
skeleton uses a Remote Reference Layer, because

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.300
a Remote Reference Layer knows how to unmarshal

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.040
the arguments that are coming in. And the the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.200
skeleton then makes the call up to the server

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.180
that is implementing the remote object. Once the server

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.959
is done with the service, the skeleton marshals the

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.690
result, and once again goes through the Remote Reference

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.240
Layer to send it over to the client. And

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.180
when it comes back, the Remote Reference Layer and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.850
the stub work together to deliver the results in

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.030
a digestible format to the client. So, marshaling and unmarshaling,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.830
they're also called serializing and deserialization in the Java world.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.660
Marshaling and unmarshaling are also called. Serializing and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.810
deserializing Java objects, and all of that is being

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.880
done by the RRL layer. So basically, the objects that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.860
are being passed this arguments, they are

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.310
serialized by the RRL, and deserialized. On the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.850
server end, and given to the server. And similarly, the result, which is also an

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.440
object, is serialized using the Remote Reference

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.190
Layer. And when it arrives on the client

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.130
side, it is deserialized, and delivered as

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.140
a result object back up to the client.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.360
Now where are the clients and the servers? Are

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.260
they on the same machine, on a different machine?

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.550
Of course we're talking about networked services, and, so

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.980
the server's going to be remote. But the server could

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.500
have several instances. There could be a single instance

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.950
of a server, or there could be multiple instances

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.211
of the server and the server may have ability

00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:59.148
for doing persistence and so on. Where is all that

00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:03.130
magic happening? Well, similar to the subcontract layer

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.800
that we discussed in the spring system, the Remote

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.210
Reference Layer is doing all the magic with

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.760
respect to. Where the server is? How the server

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.410
is handling request? Is it replicated? Is it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.320
a singleton server? All of these things are being

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.660
handled through the Remote Reference Layer. So what

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.690
that means is it allows for various invocation protocols

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.590
between the client and the servers. And all of those things are buried in the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.680
Remote Reference Layer. And the actual clients and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.660
the servers can be impervious to those details.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.050
So, the Java run time stack, the RRL layer is a very crucial layer. And it

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.520
has functionalities very similar to the subcontract mechanism

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.140
and the spring system. And as I mentioned

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.406
earlier Java RMI derives a lot from the subcontract mechanism.

00:03:56.406 --> 00:03:59.160
And, so there is not much surprise that there are

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.840
similarities between the RRL layer and the subcontract mechanism. Having

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.460
discussed RRL, let's go and talk about, the transport layer.
