00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.882
We would need to make sure that each element of the domain is paired with

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:08.392
exactly one element of the range of the function. One way to do this

00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:11.837
graphically would be to draw the curve, and then, to use the vertical line test

00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:17.865
to see how many places this curve touches any given vertical line. If it never

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:23.500
touches any vertical line more than once, then it is a function. And it looks

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.740
like the answer in this case is, yes, this is a function.
