00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One way to solve this problem is to add a count to the modular exponentiation routine given in class,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but I'd like to discuss another way of counting the number of multiplications.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First, I want to observer that when a number is represented in binary,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it's easy to tell if it's odd or even.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
All you have to do is look at the last digit.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For example, 10 is 1010, a 11 is 1011.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Dividing by 2 is a shift right.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For example, 20 to 10 to 5 is shift and then another shift.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In our modular exponentiation routine, if our exponent is even, we divide by 2.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It costs 1 multiplication.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If our exponent is odd, we subtract 1 from it,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which will make it even, and then we divide by 2.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If our exponent is odd, it costs 2 multiplications.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
From this, we can easily see that for every 1 in the exponent when written in binary,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we do two multiplications, and for every 0 we do only do one multiplication.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Writing our four exponents in binary, where 1023 is--that should hopefully be ten 1s--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
gives us a cost of 20; 1015 has a cost of 13; 4096--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which should be 1 followed by hopefully 12 zeros--gives a cost of 14;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and 4097 gives a cost of 15.

00:01:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So 1023 is out most expensive operation, and that is our correct answer.
