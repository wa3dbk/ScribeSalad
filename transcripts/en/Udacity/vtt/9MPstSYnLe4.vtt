To scale something is to make it larger or smaller. This operation is somewhat

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:09.040
different than translation and rotation. When we translate or rotate an object,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.893
we don't change it's shape or it's volume. These two operations are what is

00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:18.535
called, rigid body transforms. The name rigid body is just what it says. If you

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:22.069
have an object and apply any number of rotations and translations to it you

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:26.045
won't change its shape. It's as if the object is made out of something, well,

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:30.784
rigid and will keep it's form. Scaling does change an object's overall size, so

00:00:30.784 --> 00:00:35.626
it's not a rigid body transform. Scaling in 3 JS is simple enough. Just as

00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:39.713
there's a translation or rotation parameter on the object, there is also a scale

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:43.474
parameter. Here's the code to make a balloon object 3 times as large as it was

00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:48.272
before. Note that unlike real life. This makes the balloon 3 times larger in all

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:53.234
ways. The thickness of the skin, the part where you seal it off, and so on. Like

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:57.296
rotation, scaling is done with respect to an origin. Since the valve of the

00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:01.326
balloon is at the origin, the valve will stay still and the balloon will expand

00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:05.658
upwards. In fact, you can scale an object differently along each of the three

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:10.116
axes, x, y, and z. This code is scaling the object along the y axis, but not the

00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:14.164
other two. A number less than 1 means you're making the object smaller. The

00:01:14.164 --> 00:01:18.915
scale shown here has the effect of compressing it along the y axis. When you

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:22.490
scale a object the same amount in all directions, like we did with the balloon,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.125
this is called uniform scaling. If the scale varies it's called non-uniform

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:32.648
scaling. Uniform scaling does not change any angles within the model itself. Non

00:01:32.648 --> 00:01:37.203
uniform scaling can modify angles. In other words, the shape of the model itself

00:01:37.203 --> 00:01:37.903
is changed.
