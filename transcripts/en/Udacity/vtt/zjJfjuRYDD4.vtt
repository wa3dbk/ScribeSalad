00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.560
In the last lesson, we talked about design, and we saw how difficult it can

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.010
be to come up with a good and effective design for a given software system. To

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.620
help address these difficulties, we will discuss

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.560
design patterns, which can support design activities by

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.710
providing general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring design

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.410
problems. Similar to architectural styles, design patterns can

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.400
help developers build better designed systems by reusing design solutions that

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.730
worked well in the past and by building on those solutions.
