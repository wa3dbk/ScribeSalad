00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.204
1 divided by negative 1 gives us negative 1. And 2 divided by negative 1 gives

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:08.477
us negative 2. Now let's look at our number line again. Of course what's shown

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:12.755
right now is the original inequality. We're just going to use the number ticks

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:16.722
for a second. Negative 1 is to the right of negative 2. It's greater than

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:20.145
negative 2. So no, this definitely does not make sense at all.
