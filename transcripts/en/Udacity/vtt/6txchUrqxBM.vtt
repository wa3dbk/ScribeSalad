inexpensive measurement devices,
and mobile computing devices,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.420
are empowering patients to become

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.970
However, for the most part, we've had a

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.950
How can physicians manage their entire
patient population effectively and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.480
efficiently?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.424
That's the topic of Lesson 8.
