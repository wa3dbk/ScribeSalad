00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's take a look. Here is one possible reading.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to take 1 and subtract 2 so I have negative 1 plus 3,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and that's going to give me 2, so 2 is definitely an answer.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If I do 1 - 2 first, I'll have -1 plus 3.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
However, what if I want to do this 2 + 3 first?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'll have 1 minus 2 plus 3 or 1 minus 5.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's going to give me -4.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Zero and 4 aren't really reachable using this expression,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but depending on whether you do the subtraction first or the addition first,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
you could either get 2 or -4. This sentence is ambiguous.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're not sure what it means or it has multiple meanings

00:00:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
just like the Jane Austen binoculars example from before.
