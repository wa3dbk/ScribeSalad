00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.719
Now that we've heard from Mora about the benefits of alternate

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.240
bandwidth, let's try it for ourselves. Looking at the histogram we created

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.360
earlier, we can see that it's skewed. We've just zoomed in

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.200
on the left side of the graph from the histogram from before.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.750
Working from his new histogram, let's add some better labels and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.190
some binning. To adjust the binwidth, I can pass the binwidth parameter

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.440
to QPLY. And for this data, I'm going to choose a value of

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.140
25. That seems pretty reasonable since we're going from zero to 1000.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.290
The other thing that I want to do is break up this x

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.770
axis every saved 50 units. To do that, I'm going to pass the

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.380
breaks parameter to our scale to x scale continuous layer. Breaks is

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.740
going to take a sequence that has a starting point, an ending point,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.310
and a step or the interval space we want on our axis.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.770
So in this case, I'm going from zero to a 1000, and

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.320
I want to step every 50 units. You can learn more about

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.370
how to manipulate the scale and the breaks on the x or y

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.380
axis by reading the link in the instructor note. When

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.240
I run the code I can see that I get

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.320
a completely different histogram. Taking a closer look, it's easy

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.360
to see that many users have less than 25 friends.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.140
These users are probably new. Now let's ask a more

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.280
interesting question. Which gender group on average has more friends

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.150
men, or women? To answer this question we need to

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.840
split this histogram into two parts for males and females.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.870
Let's see if you can do that.
