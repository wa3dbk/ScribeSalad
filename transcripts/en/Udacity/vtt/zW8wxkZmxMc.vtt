00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.885
Okay, so we want someone with the closest answer to the number of candies in the

00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:11.627
jar. So I could do the number of candies in the jar minus the number of candies

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.478
guessed. So for Katie, there were 734 candies in the jar, minus 743, her guess.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:24.173
I have positive 734, and negative 743. I know that this number is more negative.

00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:31.112
It's nine more negative. So I have negative 9. For Kogure I had 734 candies in

00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:37.444
the jar minus 728, her guess. And I got 6. For Andy, he was off by 20. And

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:42.912
Kathleen negative 12. There's one problem with these results. We want to know

00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:47.999
who was the closest to the number of candies in the jar. Katie's guess was off

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:53.137
by 9. She guessed 743. And she was actually over by 9. She went too high. So in

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.224
this case, a negative sign means we were over our guess. Kogure was 6 candies

00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:03.235
off. She was under. She guessed 728. 728 is less than 734. So in this case, a

00:01:03.247 --> 00:01:08.135
positive 6 would mean that she was under. Andy guessed 714 and that was 20

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:13.360
candies away from the answer. Kathleen was also over. She guessed 746, so she

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:18.585
was 12 units above. The positive and negatives mean something in this context.

00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:23.808
The negatives mean that we were above the guess like Katie and Kathleen. For

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.112
Kogure and Andy, however, they guessed below the number of candies in the jar,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.222
so they wound up with a positive answer, based on our model. Remember, I

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:36.684
shouldn't really care about the negative and positives here. I just want to know

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:41.074
who was the closest to the number of candies in the jar. I'm only concerned with

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:45.134
how far away everyone's guess was from 734. I don't care if the result was

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:49.913
negative or positive. If I want to know the absolute difference, I should use

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:54.633
absolute value. This is the symbol that we saw at the start of this lesson.

00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:59.763
Absolute value is the distance from zero. It just says how far away we are from

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:04.771
zero. So Katie's guess was really 9 candies off. Kogure's guess was 6 candies

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:09.491
off. Andy's guess was 20 units off, and Kathleen's guess was 12 units off.

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:13.887
Notice that the absolute value took the positive res ult of all the numbers.

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:16.039
Let's look at this in another example.
