00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's take a break and talk a bit about computer security--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a topic we really haven't touched on much in this unit so far.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Security can sometimes be defined as computing in the presence of an adversary--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
someone else using a computer or a network or resources

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
who means you hard or hopes to exploit or take advantage of resources

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
resources that you've put out there.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It just so happens--you'll be surprised to discover I am breaking this news--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that the internet is not secure.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Malicious agents or adversaries can write malicious webpages or JavaScript fragments.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The simplest way to do this would be to write a JavaScript fragment that loops forever--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
some sort of version of Fibonacci that has no stopping condition

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that just keeps going and going and going.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then as soon as you've directed your browser to that page, it would stall,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and you'd be denied some server. You wouldn't be able to use your computer.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In practice, browsers often put some sort of timeout on script execution.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll run your script for 3 or 4 seconds, and after that if it hasn't finished, I'd better stop.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that's one of the reasons why optimization is so important, but it also has this security angle.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If we make any mistakes when we're designing our web browser,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
then outside agents might break in to our computers and gain access

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to sensitive documents--our tax returns, our personal email, or whatnot.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We want to make sure that that doesn't happen.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Let's listen to someone who knows quite a bit more about security than I do

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
talk about how this plays out in the real world with web browsers.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The web can be a great place but it can also be a dangerous place.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Nothing stops users from posting malicious code or websites

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or writing scripts that will trying to take advantage of your computer or your browser.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There might be security holes or exploits, they're sometimes called, that allow this.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I was wondering if you might talk a bit about security at the language or implementation level

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
from the perspective of Mozilla.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Absolutely. Security is a prevalent concern at Mozilla.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
When I was growing up, the idea of getting a piece of software was that you actually

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
drove to a store and you looked at a shelf and you pulled a box off the shelf

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and you paid somebody and you took it home and that piece of software was sold to you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
by a company that you trusted, by a third party that you trusted,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
so you had some sense of this piece of software that I'm about to put on my computer

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is something that I can believe is going to do something on behalf,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
not something against me.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The web doesn't work like that way at all.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The way web applications work is you can go to any website anywhere in the world,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and somebody you've never met and never seen and that nobody can vouch for you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
is going to run some of their code that they wrote on your computer.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So that changes the game.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
That means that in order to build a serious platform where programs can do important things

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
on your behalf, we need to make sure that they can't also do important things against you.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The more people put valuable parts of their lives onto the web like their bank account,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
for example, the more we have important assets to defend.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
One of the concepts people talk about a lot in security is the notion of the trust computing base.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
When you download some code from some third party that you don't know,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
if we're being kind of maximally pessimistic we say, well, I don't trust this code completely.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I'd like it to do something for me but I don't know for sure that it's not malicious.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
However, that code is running inside of a web browser like Firefox,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and I do trust the code that was written by Mozilla. I do trust Firefox.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
In order to be able to say as much as we can about the security of a system,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
we'd like for the parts of the system that we need to trust the most

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to be as small as possible, so we talk about shrinking the trusted computing base,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
as being a goal of having the smallest possible amount of software where if it goes wrong

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
disaster can ensue--like somebody can steal or credit card information or your bank account.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
All modern web browsers are implemented in C++.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, C++ is a very powerful language. There are a lot of things that you can do with it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
But it's also not a particularly safe language.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's a language where if you make one wrong move, if you make one little programming mistake,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
you can actually leave parts of your system open to malicious programs.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
For example, if you write a program in C++ and you have an array of data

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and you forget to make sure that the program doesn't go beyond the end of that array,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
in most programming languages you'll get a runtime error that says,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
"Oops. You tried to access beyond the end of the array."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
C++ doesn't give you that protection.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What C++ does is it just keeps reading what ever happens to be in memory

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
at the end of that array.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Well, whatever happens to be in memory could actually be some part of the browser

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that has internal information like a password.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It could also be some other program running on the system,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and there are a lot of people out there who work on finding ways to exploit

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
these kinds of bugs to use them to take control of your computer or to get access to your private data.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The project of building a web browser that people can trust

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and building a web browser that operates on user's behalf

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is also one of building software that they can trust.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
In order to build software that they can trust,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
it needs to be built on top of programming technologies

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that we know we can work with effectively to build software that's not unsafe.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We've been discussing malicious code like JavaScript written by evildoers

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that we would run in our interpreter. Running evil code seems really bad.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Can't I just look at the source code and tell if it's bad before I run it

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and then not run the bad code? Why doesn't Mozilla do something like that.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Unfortunately, it turns out that there's a lot of good theoretical computer science

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that shows us that that is a provably impossible problem.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I don't know if you've discussed the halting program. &gt;&gt;We may have.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It turns out that if I were able to prove that any particular piece of code was not malicious

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I would also be able to solve the halting problem,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and we already know that that's an unsolvable problem in computer science.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Looking at this maybe from a more positive side,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that means that I'll always have a job.

00:06:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The law of compiler writer employability. &gt;&gt;Exactly.
