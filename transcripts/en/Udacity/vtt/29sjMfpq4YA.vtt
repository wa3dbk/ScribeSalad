00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
We've presented at a high level what the programming model looks like.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.282
Now what you need to know is what is the GPU good at?

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:09.513
How is it going to be good at running programs I write in this programming model?

00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:11.052
So what is the GPU good at?

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.316
For now, let me just tell you two things.

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:15.556
Keep these in mind as you're planning your program.

00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:21.157
Thing number one: it is really good at efficiently launching lots of threads.

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:26.126
You may be used to other programming environments where launching threads is an expensive process.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.665
That is not the case here.

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:33.677
In fact, as we'll discuss later, if you're not launching lots of threads, you're not using the GPU effectively.

00:00:33.677 --> 00:00:37.005
Dave, my co-instructor, likes to say that the GPU doesn't even

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.108
get out of bed in the morning for fewer than a 1000 threads.

00:00:40.108 --> 00:00:42.842
The second thing that a GPU is good at is actually running

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:46.284
lots of those threads in parallel all at the same time.

00:00:46.284 --> 00:00:49.149
Now we're going to consider a simple example.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.856
We're going to take an input array of 64 floating point numbers, numbered 0 to 63,

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:57.660
and we're going to square each number in the array.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.709
So the output will be 0, 1, 4, 9, and so on.

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:03.367
We're going to do this in three steps.

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:06.432
We're going to start by looking at how we'd run this code on the CPU.

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:10.036
Then we'll talk about how we'd run this on the GPU without looking at code,

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.207
instead just discussing what our code would do.

00:01:12.207 --> 00:01:14.611
Then we'll dive into what the code actually looks like.
