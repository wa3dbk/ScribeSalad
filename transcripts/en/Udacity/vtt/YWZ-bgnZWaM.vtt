00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.280
Here's something that kind of surprises
many people when they learn SQL.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.280
So far whenever you've done a select.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.400
You've selected from either a table or
a few joined tables.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.005
There's another thing you
can select from as well.

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.650
Namely the results of a select query.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.150
This is one form of something called
a subquery or sometimes a subselect.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.900
Remember back in lesson one when I
mentioned that the result of a query

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.410
is always a table?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.710
This is why.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.570
Since the result of a query is a table
you can select from it, join it,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.470
aggregate it, and so on.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.460
Here's a table that lists mooseball
players and what team they're on and

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.240
the number of points they
scored in the last season.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.190
And here's a query that will find
the highest scoring player's score for

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.470
each team.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.930
This uses the max aggregation, grouping
by team, to find the highest score.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.585
But suppose that we want to know
what the average score of a highest

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:54.990
scorer is.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.540
To do this we can take this whole query
and stick it inside of another query.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.760
The outside query, gives the average
of the inside query's results.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.680
The syntax of SQL requires that we give
the subquery result table a name, maxes

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.000
here, even though we don't actually
use that word anyplace in the query.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.750
It's just required.
