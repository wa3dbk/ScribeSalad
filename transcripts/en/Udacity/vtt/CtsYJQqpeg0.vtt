Assuming nothing has changed about this parabola, compared to y equals x squared,

00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:08.913
aside from the entire thing shifting. We know that the whole thing needs to

00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:13.265
shift by h coordinates in the horizontal direction, and k coordinates in the

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:17.926
vertical direction. So the vertex will move to (h,k). If we replace x, with the

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:22.306
quantity x minus h, and y with the quantity y minus k, this gives us a final

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:26.956
equation of y minus k equals the quantity x minus h squared. So anytime we see

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:31.855
an equation written in this form, we can automatically tell where its vertex is.

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:36.314
This is going to be super useful as you move forward, doing more and more with

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:37.056
parabolas.
