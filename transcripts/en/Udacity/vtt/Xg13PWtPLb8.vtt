00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It looks like Crazy definitely has the most power here. Crazy publishes the final votes.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Crazy could decide not to include votes that aren't for the rate selection.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Crazy could tamper with the votes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The one validation we have is the voters can check that their vote is in that list.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So Crazy can't add extra votes if the number of votes in the beginning is known.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Crazy could replace some votes and change those votes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And there's no way with this scheme yet for a voter to prove that Crazy cheated.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If the voter can prove that Crazy cheated, well then maybe it's not such an advantage to be Crazy.

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So is there a way for the voter to prove that their vote was not included?
