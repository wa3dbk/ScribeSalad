00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.942
Here are the equations for each of the pieces of our line over here. The first

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:08.164
one was pretty easy to figure out, it's just y equals 0. Since this is just a

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:12.800
horizontal line at well, y equals 0. For each of these other three equations, I

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.440
started out using point-slope form and then transformed to have equations in

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.678
slope-intercept form. Over here on the graph, I wrote the tax rates

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:24.123
corresponding to each of the brackets to make reminding myself of the slope of

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:28.803
each line really easy. Then I just picked a point for each line that was easy

00:00:28.803 --> 00:00:33.414
to identify. Plugging in all of that information gave us these equations. For

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:39.259
the lowest bracket, we have y equals 0.1x minus 500. For the middle one we have

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:44.535
y equals 0.2x minus 2000. And for the highest bracket, or at least the highest

00:00:44.535 --> 00:00:48.383
one shown here, we have y equals 0.3x minus 5500.
