00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.176
Even though composition of functions 
probably felt quite new at the beginning

00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:06.074
of this lesson, you've actually been 
doing it since the very first lesson of

00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:09.400
this course. 
There, we came up with an equation for

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.780
the amount of money that Grant has left 
at any given time.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.376
Initially, we said that the money Grant 
has left Is equal to the money he got

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:22.200
from his venture capital funders, minus 
the total amount of money he spent so far.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.280
Here, we're using dollar amounts for all 
these different quantities.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.320
Then, however, we found out that money 
spent changed as time passed.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.712
Then we got a second equation, showing 
that the total amount of money spent is

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:38.104
equal to the money Grant spends per month 
times the number of months that have

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:42.720
passed, or the number of months he's been 
in business.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.280
Let's get some variables and numbers back 
in here, to make everything look a bit cleaner.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.062
Let's say that the money Grant has left 
is called M.

00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:57.340
And as we knew before, he started out 
with $3 million from his venture capitalists.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.030
Let's also give total money spent a new 
name, like S.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.176
Well that looks way nicer. 
We can see M is actually a function of S.

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:08.062
It depends on S. 
So I'm going to change this left side of

00:01:08.062 --> 00:01:12.620
the equation to read M of S. 
But, S itself is a function of the number

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.182
of months that have passed. 
Since Grant spends a set amount iof money

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:20.798
per month, that monthly spending number 
was $100,000.

00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:25.500
So if we say that number of months is 
just equal to n, then we have another function.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.014
S equals 100,000 n. 
And actually, since S is a function of n,

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:32.756
we should rewrite this side over here. 
This should say S of n.

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:37.440
Making it abundantly clear that as n 
changes, S is going to change as well.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.829
Taking all this into account, what do we 
get for M of S of n?
