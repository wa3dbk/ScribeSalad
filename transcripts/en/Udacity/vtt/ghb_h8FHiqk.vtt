We want to measure the effect of caffeine on reaction time in Udacity

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.960
employees. There are many ways we can do this. But which of the following do

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.780
you think is best? Should we find employees who've already had a varying amount

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.450
of caffeine and measure their reaction time and see if it changes between them?

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.860
Should we give caffeine in varying amounts to different groups of employees and

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.670
then measure their reaction times. Should we ask people who have already had

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.120
caffeine how they feel their reaction times have been affected? Pick which one

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.610
you think is best. Don't worry if you don't know the answer just yet, but take

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.200
a second and try to think about it.
