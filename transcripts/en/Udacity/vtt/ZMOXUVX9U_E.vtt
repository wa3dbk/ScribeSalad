00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.830
What are the strikes against a microkernel based

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.160
design? The first strike is the border crossing

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.050
cost going between kernel and the user and vice versa. And this you have to do

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.990
every time a user-level process makes a system

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.440
call. You have to go through the kernel.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.330
That's the border crossing cost. So that is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.500
the first explicit cost that can be a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.500
strike against microkernel if this were to happen too often. The second

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.500
strike against a microkernel based design is address space

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.640
switches. With the assumption that each system service is living in

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.858
its own hardware address space, whenever an application needs

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:50.630
any system service, that may involve the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.200
servers living above the microkernel having to talk

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.060
to one another in order to provide that

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.220
particular service that was requested by the application.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.900
And I mentioned that protected procedure call is

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.160
the basis for cross protection domain calls. So

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.830
here's the protection domain, a file system. Here

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.320
is another protection domain, the storage module. And,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.120
if the file system has to get some service

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.310
out of the storage module in order to serve the original request from the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.587
application process, that communication is implemented as a protected

00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:31.060
procedure call. And going across hardware address spaces minimally

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.210
involves flushing the TLB of the processor in

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.480
order to make room for the TLB entries of the domain

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.450
that we're entering. And we'll talk about that in a little bit more detail

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.540
shortly. But the key point is, there's an explicit cost involved in going from

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.830
one address space to another address space, and that is the second strike

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.895
against a microkernel based design. The third strike against

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:06.670
microkernel-based design is the cost for doing

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.840
thread switches. These thread switches have to be mediated by the kernel. If the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.100
file system needs to make a protected

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.280
procedure call to the storage module, in order

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.670
to complete an application level request for

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.480
an operating system service, that involves the file

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.095
system having to be mediated through the

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:31.940
microkernel in order to go and execute some

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.000
functionality in the storage module. So that

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.080
involves a thread switch, and IPC, in order

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.280
to do that. So in other words, the basis for protected procedure call is thread

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.120
switches and interprocess communication, which has to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.314
be mediated through the kernel. And this kernel

00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:53.322
mediation can be expensive, that is, thread switches

00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:57.207
and interprocess communication can be expensive. That's the

00:02:57.207 --> 00:03:03.250
third strike against a microkernel. So all of these three strikes that I

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.210
mentioned are explicit costs associated with

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.245
providing an application level service in a

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:14.300
microkernel based operating system, because the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.890
application has to first make a request

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.350
to the micro kernel. Microkernel may have to pass that request on to server

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.890
processes that are living above the microkernel, and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.720
the server processes may have to talk to

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.290
one another. And this protected procedure call itself

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.710
has to be mediated by the microkernel via

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.710
thread switching and interprocess communication. And in addition

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.900
to all of these explicit costs, there could

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.700
be a fourth cost, which is the implicit cost. And this is due to the memory

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.450
subsystem and the loss of locality that

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.780
can happen when we are going across address

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.800
spaces. And when the file system makes

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.550
a protected procedure call into the storage module,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.260
at that point, we are changing locality

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.960
from the address space of the file system

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.600
to the address space of the storage module.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.900
And therefore, the thread that starts executing inside

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.060
the storage module may not find the cache warm, meaning, the contents of the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.400
cache may not be reflecting the working set of the storage module that needs to

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.460
get executed right now in order to satisfy the request coming from the file

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.310
server. And this loss of locality can

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.210
be both for address translation in the TLB,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.420
for this new address space that we are

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.950
in, as well as for data and instructions that

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.690
are contained in the cache. Both of those may

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.270
take a hit because of the fact that we're

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.040
going from one address space to another address

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.060
space. That's the implicit cost of the locality loss

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.630
that would be the fourth strike against a microkernel-based

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.990
design. All of these strikes against a microkernel-based design,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.230
seems pretty solid. Now how does L3 go about

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.730
debunking, the myths about microkernel-based

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.180
design. Let's see that, systematically.
