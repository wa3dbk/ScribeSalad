00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.547
So clearly order mattres a lot. 
go f of x and f of g of x, using these

00:00:04.547 --> 00:00:08.695
two equations give us completely 
different expressions.

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:12.111
We need to be super careful which 
function we're using as the input for the

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:15.943
other one. 
What if our functions were f of x equals

00:00:15.943 --> 00:00:20.414
x squared minus four? 
And g of x equals the square root of 4

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:24.537
minus x squared. 
Then what will we get for f of g of x or

00:00:24.537 --> 00:00:26.619
f composed of g?
