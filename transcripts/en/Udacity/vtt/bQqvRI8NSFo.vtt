00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.059
So we observed that the latency between where I am now, which is Palo Alto,

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.370
California, and Cambridge, Massachusetts is 100 milliseconds,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.740
and that's what we measured using traceroute. And

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.256
the distance between those two locations is

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:18.990
4,300 kilometers. So the question is, at what

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.352
fraction of the speed of light which is

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:25.770
300,000 kilometres per second, did my data travel

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.730
between Palo Alto and Cambridge.
