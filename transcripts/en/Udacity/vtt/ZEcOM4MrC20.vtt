00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.370
We set our goals in the beginning
because they will effect the rest of

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.880
the decisions we make.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.610
For example, if our goal is related
to brand awareness, we may choose to

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.790
advertise on bill boards and the online
equivalent of bill boards, display ads.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.690
If you goal is driving more traffic
to your website, you'll probably

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.290
focus your advertising with online
ads with clear call to action.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.420

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.590
If your goals are very specific
to one segment or audience or

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.680
location, then you may choose some
local channels to advertise on.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.159
It might hanging posters
in the local dog park.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.900
Or having your online ad on
the homepage of a local popular

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.530
business in your town.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.255
For us one of the goals we have set for

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:43.368
Abarkment is to increase traffic of
dogs owners to our website 5% monthly.

00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:45.920
That means that we're going to
focus our marketing plan on

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.960
online ads that target
our niche audience.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.860
We might also produce a funny video,
fancy dogs, and a call to action at

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.910
the end that says, receive our
promotional offer or a launch special.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180
And then we're just going to
hope the video goes viral and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.070
we get even more customers.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.570
Now, for our goal or brand awareness,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.170
we'd probably prefer to use display
ads on dog related websites.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.910
Or run a Facebook, Pinterest, or

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.550
a Google+ campaign inside
dog owner communities.
