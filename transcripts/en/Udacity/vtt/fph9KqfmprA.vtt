00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.222
Here's a test of your knowledge of shading and illumination models. We have

00:00:03.222 --> 00:00:08.154
Phong compared to Gouraud and we have Blinn-Phong compared to Lambertian. Say we

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.759
have a scene and try out each of these four combinations. Assume that shading

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.170
costs in execution time far outweigh the illumination costs. In other words, if

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.082
a fragment shader is used to evaluate illumination. It'll be considerably more

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:25.174
expensive than any vertex spaced shading approach. Assign each combination a

00:00:25.174 --> 00:00:29.688
number, rating them from least to most expensive in cost. In other words, 1

00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:33.473
means the smallest amount of time needed, 4 means the largest.
