00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.543
To solve this one, we plug these values into this equation as shown. When I do

00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:09.393
vector math, I don't not like double negatives. So I usually fold this minus

00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:14.747
into the coordinates themselves. Adding up these coordinates, the final answer

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.460
is negative 6, 9, and 42.
