Great job! This is really tough stuff and as long as you understand the

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:08.297
properties of the normal distribution and you understand what we're doing rather

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:12.361
than memorizing it you'll be fine. Below I'll provide a link to an app the

00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:17.111
allows you to visualize the area under the curve less than any Z score. So check

00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:22.057
it out if you want, and that might help better understand this whole process.

00:00:22.057 --> 00:00:26.903
But you'll get better and better at it as we go through this class. Good job!
