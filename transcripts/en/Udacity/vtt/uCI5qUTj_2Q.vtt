00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.780
Let's start our decision of design patterns by looking

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.280
at the history of patterns. As you know, I like

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.810
to give this sort of historical perspective on how and

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.600
when concepts were defined. In this case, we have to

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.830
go back to 1977, when Christopher Alexander, an American professor

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.300
of architecture at UC Berkeley, introduces the idea of patterns,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.700
successful solutions to problems, in his book called a Pattern

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.640
Language. The book contains about 250 patterns. And the idea

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.700
is that occupants of a building should be able

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.110
to design it. And the patterns in the book provide

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.368
a way to do that. And this idea of design

00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:35.964
patterns, so, a formal way of documenting successful solutions to

00:00:35.964 --> 00:00:41.200
problems, inspired several other disciplines. In particular, in 1987,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.810
Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck leveraged this idea of Alexander's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.360
patterns in the context of an object oriented language.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840
And in this specific the language was Smalltalk.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.666
Some of you might know the language. So what Cunningham

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:56.320
and Beck did, was to create a 5 pattern

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.880
language for guiding novice Smalltalk programmers. So they did

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.090
an experiment and had several developers using their patterns, and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.330
the experiment was extremely successful. The users were able to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.940
create elegant designs using the provided patterns. And in case

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.210
you are interested in reading about it, Cunningham and Beck

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.660
reported the results in the article, Using Pattern Languages for

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.940
Object Oriented Programs, which was published at the

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.854
International Conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:25.390
Applications, also called OOPSLA, in 1987. At the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.480
same time, Eric Gamma was working on his dissertation,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.030
whose topic was the importance of patterns and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.430
how to capture them. Between 1987 and 1992, there

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.520
were several workshops related to design patterns. And

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.740
in 1992, Jim Coplien compiled a catalog of C++

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.140
items, which are some sort of patterns, and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.130
he listed this catalog of patterns in his

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.720
book, which was titled Advanced C++ Programming Styles

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.952
and Idioms. Finally, in 1993 and 1994, there were

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:56.160
several additional workshops focused on patterns. And this

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.625
workshop brought together many patterns folks, including these

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.040
4 guys, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040
and John Vlissides. These guys are also known as

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.970
the gang of 4. And the result of this collaboration was the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.840
famous book Design Patterns: Elements of

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.320
Reusable Object Oriented Software. So this

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.640
is basically The Book on design patterns. If you want to buy

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.780
a book on design pattern, this is the one you should get.
