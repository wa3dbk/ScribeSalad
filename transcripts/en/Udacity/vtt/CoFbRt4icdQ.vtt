00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:08.015
Remember that the whole area under the curve in terms of proportions is 1. And

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:15.132
therefore, if 95% or 0.95 is between negative 2 and 2. Remember, these are the z

00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:20.216
scores. And same with this skinny normal distribution. 95% is between two

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:25.875
standard deviations below, and two standard deviations above the mean. So, that

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:31.925
must mean that the remaining proportions here, are 1 minus .95, which is 0.05.

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:38.203
So, a proportion of 0.05, or 5%, is either below 2 or above 2 standard

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:45.651
deviations. That means then that since this data is symmetrical, 2.5% is on this

00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:52.292
tail and 2.5% is on this tail, same here. You don't have to memorize this. If

00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:58.820
you know that 68% is within one standard deviation, and 95% is within two, you

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.348
can always know the percentage, or the proportion in between any two integer

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:10.945
standard deviations for the mean. We're going to practice that now.
