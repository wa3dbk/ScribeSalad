The first sleep disorder we're going to talk about is Sleep Apnea. This is a

00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:07.206
condition that results in a person having pauses in breathing while they're

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:13.260
sleeping, or shallow breathing. The pauses can last a few seconds or minutes.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.114
This can happen up to 30 times or more an hour. In most cases, a person starts

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:22.466
breathing normally again, however this interruption in sleep causes the person

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:28.106
to go from deep sleep to light sleep. So this in turn results in a poor quality

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:33.372
of sleep. It makes the person tired the next day. This is one of the leading

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:36.635
causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.
