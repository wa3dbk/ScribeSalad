00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.393
Now that you know how to implement methods, let's move on to constructors. You

00:00:03.393 --> 00:00:08.100
want to be able to create variations of objects. For example, a car that's very

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.100
fuel efficient or a car that is less so. In Java you use constructors to

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.805
initialize objects, here is an example. In the body of the constructor we

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:21.748
simply initialize the instance variables. The first two here are set to a

00:00:21.748 --> 00:00:25.974
constant value. When a car is first created, it has not driven any miles and

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:30.685
its tank is empty. This instance variable is set to a parameter, and that

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:36.355
allows you to construct cars with different properties. Here, we construct a

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:41.988
car with 60 miles per gallon. The value 60 is passed into the parameter

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:47.890
variable. And is then set the instance variable here. Over here we construct a

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.784
car with 5 miles per gallon and again, the 5 is passed into the parameter

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:57.636
variable. And then used to initialize this instance variable. A couple of

00:00:57.636 --> 00:01:02.210
things to pay attention to, when you define the constructor, note the name.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.864
It's the same as the class name. The class is called car, the constructor is

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:11.114
called car. Also note that there's no return type at all not even void. The

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:15.060
constructor is not a method. It does not return any value. Instead the job of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.398
constructor is just to initialize the instance variables. You can have more

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:23.196
than one constructor and you'll get a change to write one right now. Here is

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:26.917
our constructor in BlueJ, you see the statements that we had just before,

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:32.328
together with a couple of statements that set's the car's picture. Now this

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:37.101
constructure always takes the same picture to construct the car. It would be

00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.759
much nicer if we could choose a different picture for every car, so let's do

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.334
that. I'd like you to write another constructure that takes two arguments, the

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:51.920
fuel efficiency and the picture file to be used. Go ahead and do that in the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.870
coding environment and submit your answer.
