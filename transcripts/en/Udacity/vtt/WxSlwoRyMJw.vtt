00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.772
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sometimes the equation isn't as easy to work with. Here this isn't in slope

00:00:03.772 --> 00:00:07.862
intercept form. I don't have y equals mx plus b. This one's actually in standard

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:11.654
form. So we want to change it into slope intercept form so we can more easily

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:15.618
graph it. If we don't want to create a table to graph this equation, then we can

00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:19.745
convert it to slope intercept form. If I subtract x from both sides I get

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:24.459
negative 2 y equals 4 minus x. Im going to rearrange these terms so the x term

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:29.151
comes first. So I have negative x first and then positive 4 right after it.

00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:33.966
Finally, to solve for y, we divide each term by negative 2, this isolates y.

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:38.996
Remember this is a negative 1 as the coefficient in front of x. When we simplify

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:43.154
this we have positive 1 half x minus 2, 4 divided by negative 2 makes negative

00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:49.202
2. Here's an equation we're familiar with. There's our y intercepts, our b, and

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:54.163
there's our slope, our m 1/2. We can just graph this like before.
