00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:01.902
So here's a simple graph.

00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:03.905
We're going to start here with node number 2,

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:06.182
and we're going to set the depth there equal to 0.

00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:10.290
And our goal is to find these depths for each of these vertices.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.152
Originally, none of these are set.

00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:14.655
We're just going to say that's the value for hasn't visited yet.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:19.321
And we're going to begin by setting vertex number 2 to the value 0.

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:23.227
So we note that the furthest vertex away from node 2 is two hops away.

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:27.802
So the maximum depth here is 2, and we should expect that we should iterate twice.

00:00:27.802 --> 00:00:31.537
So we're going to begin the algorithm by looking at all of these edges in parallel.

00:00:31.537 --> 00:00:33.336
And what we're looking for is a pattern

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:37.708
where one of the vertices of these edges is going to have a depth value set,

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:39.512
and the other one does not.

00:00:39.512 --> 00:00:42.480
And we're going to find that 3 edges have this particular quality.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.516
So one of them is going to be the edge between 1 and 2.

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:47.182
We'll check and see.

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:53.503
The depth at vertex 2 is 0 and vertex 1 has not been visited yet.

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:57.231
So we'll set it equal to 0 plus 1, which is 1.

00:00:57.231 --> 00:01:01.131
We'll do the same thing for this edge here between 2 and 3, okay?

00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:03.467
We visited 2; its value was 0.

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.066
We haven't visited 3, so we set its value to be 1.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.306
And this edge here, 2 and 6.

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:10.408
Now we complete the first iteration.

00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:12.409
We visited every single edge

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.956
and run 6 threads in parallel to make this particular determination.

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:18.961
Now we begin our second iteration.

00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:21.217
So now, again, what we're looking for is an edge

00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:24.367
where the vertex value of one end of the edge has been set

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.690
and the other one has not yet been visited.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.997
So we're going to find that's true for the other 3 edges.

00:01:28.997 --> 00:01:34.501
So the edge between 0 and 1, we find that the depth at vertex number 1 is 1.

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:37.540
We find that vertex 0 has not yet been visited.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.305
So we set its depth to 1 plus 1 equals 2.

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:44.625
And the same is going to be true for the edges between 3 and 4

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.208
and the edge between 5 and 6, okay?

00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:50.287
Now we filled in a value for all of our vertices here,

00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:52.000
and we're thus complete.
