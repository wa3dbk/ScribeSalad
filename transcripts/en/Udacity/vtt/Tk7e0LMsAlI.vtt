00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.790
And the DQ principle is also very useful for managing graceful

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.560
degradation of service. So DQ defines to

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.850
total system capacity. So if a server is saturated, meaning that

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.110
we have reached the limit of the server in terms of DQ. That's a constant.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.200
DQ's a constant. And so if you reach that limit, then we have a choice

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.570
of graceful degrading the service from the point

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.439
of view of the client. One possibility is

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.630
we keep the harvest the same meaning that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.070
every client request that comes in has complete fidelity

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.620
in terms of the answers returned by the

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.820
server. So D is fixed. Q comes down because

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.490
DQ is a constant. That's one option. The

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.860
other option, of course, is to keep the volume

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.950
of clients that are service, that is the yield Q to be a constant, but decrease

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.615
the harvest. So the fidelity of the results returned to the users is less than.

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:11.290
100%, but we keeping more of the user community happy by serving more of them.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.740
Because DQ is a constant, it allows us

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.460
to gracefully degrade the service being provided by

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.150
the server depending on the choice you want to make in terms of fidelity of the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.970
result or the yield that you want to provide the user community. In other words.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.240
The DQ principle gives us an explicit strategy

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.120
for managing saturation. So as a system administrator,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.400
when we make these decisions on which to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.560
sacrifice and which to keep constant, we know

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.010
how our decisions are going to affect the harvest,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.990
how it's going to affect the yield. How it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.590
is going to affect the up time and so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.820
on. So the choices that a system provider has

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.860
or strategies that a system provider can use

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.180
in structuring the servers, knowing that DQ is

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.210
a constant, is when the server is saturated.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.740
They can do cost based admission control. You pay

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.227
more, you get more. That may be one way to do it. Or priority or value based

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:15.830
admission control. That may be another way to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.320
deal with service saturation or reduce data freshness. That

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.860
is the harvest may be the same, but

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.280
you reduce the fidelity of the data. For instance,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.950
if I'm serving videos, and I can serve

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.830
the videos at different bit rates, if the server

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.400
is saturated, I might decide to serve the video to all the users, all the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.130
videos that they want, but at a lower bit rate. So that is reducing the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.810
fidelity. Of the data that is being harvested. So that's the idea behind the DQ

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.740
principle, how it might be used for graceful

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.590
degradation of service when the server is saturated.
