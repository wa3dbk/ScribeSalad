00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.240
Predication, is another way that we can

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.520
try to deal with control hazards, Unlike branch

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.554
prediction. when we are really trying to guess

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:12.181
which way, the if-then-else or a bloop or

00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:15.731
something branch will be going, predication, is another

00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:20.065
way for dealing with control dependencies. Brown friction,

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:23.032
Is about guessing, where the program is going.,

00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:25.654
Usually there is no penalty for being correct

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:29.242
in branch prediction, pretty much we just keep fetching, as

00:00:29.242 --> 00:00:32.369
if the branch wasn't even there. Even if the branch

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430
is actually taken, we can just keep fetching from the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.945
right place and thus avoid any penalty. But the problem with

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.260
branch prediction, Is that in modern processor, there is a

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.728
huge penalty if we are wrong in predicting. Keep in

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:47.924
mind that modern processors have a deep bite, with lots

00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:50.848
of stages, before the one in which we figure out the

00:00:50.848 --> 00:00:53.160
mass prediction, And in each stage, we

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.540
have a number of instructions that we have

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.155
been doing. So, in this prediction, results

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:02.207
in throwing away all of that work. Usually,

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:05.444
at least several tens, of instructions worth

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:08.017
of work, So the penalty is usually 0

00:01:08.017 --> 00:01:11.669
instructions here, and if we have something like,

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:15.985
maybe, a 12 stage pipeline,with four instructions, Per

00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:20.950
cycle. We're talking about something like 48 possible

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.610
instructions or so, so let's say about 50

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.970
instructions, worth of work wasted. Predication is about

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.895
doing work, of the both of the directions,so

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:35.770
we basically do the work of both the taken and not taken direction of a branch,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.730
that way the waste is up to 50% of the work that we have been doing.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.835
Because at the position where the branch was supposed

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:46.997
to be, about half of the stuff we've been fetching.

00:01:46.997 --> 00:01:49.307
could have been from one path, half of the

00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:51.749
stuff was from the other and only half of that

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.191
work will actually be used, the rest will be

00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:57.923
thrown away. And then we simply throw away the work

00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:01.650
from the wrong path, So, what is good about this?

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.913
It seems like here, if we're correct, We lose nothing,

00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:12.920
if we are wrong we lose a lot, but we can very accurate prediction. While here,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.661
either way, we lose quite a bit. Well, let's see how the branch prediction

00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.937
and something like predication,compare on different types

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:25.330
of condition branches we might want to predict.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.180
For a loop, usually we want to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.954
do branch prediction, Loop branches, the more iterations

00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:35.130
we have, the more they are predictable. Whereas,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.270
with predication, in each iteration of the loop, we

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.505
will be dividing our work into two. One is

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:44.060
do the next iteration, the other one is do

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.177
the work after the loop, So, if we

00:02:46.177 --> 00:02:49.754
have 1,000 iterations, very little of the work will

00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:53.337
end up being done correctly. Simply the branch is

00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:55.960
diverging too much, When we need to decide whether

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.290
to stay in the loop or not, we will be starting the work of both of these.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.470
One, path goes after the loop, the other one,goes

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.510
back into the loop and then here we have

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.310
a decision again to follow that path,or stay in

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.348
the loop that path, stay in the loop. So,

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:17.894
after awhile if we're still doing the work of

00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:21.177
all of these paths concurrently, a very small fraction,

00:03:21.177 --> 00:03:24.460
of the work we are doing ends up being the staying in the loop

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.872
work. And a lot of it has to do with various variants of exiting

00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:35.484
the loop, in each iteration, So for a loop, we want to predict function

00:03:35.484 --> 00:03:40.399
call returns, Same thing. Except, predication

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:46.040
really makes no sense, because calls and returns.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.080
Always go there, so somehow the direction of not going there makes no sense

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.926
to do so we want to predict. Let's say no we have a

00:03:55.926 --> 00:04:01.062
large if then else, so what happens we have a decision and

00:04:01.062 --> 00:04:05.877
based on it we do,this or we do this, Now the question

00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:11.110
is? Should we try to predict this decision or predicate so

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.098
that we are doing the work of both and eventually, they will merge and

00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:21.774
re-continue, and the answer here, is that if we predict, we waste up to 50

00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:26.480
instructions, More likely we wasted nothing. If

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.840
we predicate and these branches, have equal wave

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.960
then, let's say we have 100 instructions

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.480
here and 100 instructions here, We will execute

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.710
200 instructions, waste 100 of them either way.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.790
To somehow, the amount of waste with predication here,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.680
Is larger than even the penalty of branch

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.070
misprediction. Pretty much, if we predict, and we are

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.350
right, we lose nothing, If we predict, and

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.990
we are wrong, we lose 50 instructions, Here, we

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.140
lose 100 instructions. And we cannot be wrong or

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.772
right. But either iii way, we are losing 100

00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:05.036
inst,ructions, So for a large if-then-else it seems

00:05:05.036 --> 00:05:07.960
like we should be predicting, but let's see, how

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.160
things look like for a small if-then-else. Let's

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.635
say that we have a decision to make, and

00:05:13.635 --> 00:05:16.560
depending on the decision, we have the, Then

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.810
or the L spot, but let's say each is

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.335
something like five instructions long, now it becomes

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:26.768
interesting. If we do predication, we will be executing,

00:05:26.768 --> 00:05:29.963
ten instructions here followed by instructions that

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:31.809
we will do anyway, so the waste

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.740
is five instructions either way. Here we're

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.610
predicting, and if we're right we waste

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.879
nothing but if we're wrong we waste 50, instructions. So, our comparison is that

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.369
100% of the time, we waste five

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:51.938
instructions with predications, so we end up with

00:05:51.938 --> 00:05:58.992
five on average. For instance of this, whereas here,our branch prediction

00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:05.156
rate determines how often we waste this 50 so it's going to be,let's say 0 point

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:10.952
10 because it's 10%, probability of mis predicting in which case we

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:16.940
end up at five two. So if our accuracy of prediction is 90% or better,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.700
then in this case we are better off predicting

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.200
the branch. But if our accuracy is less than

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.410
90%, we are better off predicating. If, if then

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.740
else, is even smaller, then it biases more in

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.760
favor of predication, and less in favor of branch

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.204
prediction. So for really small, if then elses, We

00:06:36.204 --> 00:06:39.332
want to predicate unless we are reasonably sure, that

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:42.530
the branch prediction is going to be highly accurate.
