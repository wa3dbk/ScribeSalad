00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.207
In problem set number 4, you will be implementing a parallel algorithm

00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:09.728
for removing the red eye effect that commonly occurs in pictures of human faces.

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:14.208
Here is an example of the effect that we are talking about.

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:18.089
You will be implementing a simple algorithm for red eye removal

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.126
that factors nicely into 3 different parallel operations.

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:27.595
The first operation is a stencil computation over the image,

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:31.601
the second is a sort, and the third is map.

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:36.673
You have been exposed to map and stencil operations in the previous homework,

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:40.442
so in this homework, you will focus on sorting.

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:44.587
We start our red eye removal algorithm

00:00:44.587 --> 00:00:48.019
by computing a score for each pixel

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.655
that estimates the likelihood of that pixel belonging to a red eye,

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.259
and here's what the score looks like.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:00.398
This score is known as normalized cross-correlation,

00:01:00.398 --> 00:01:04.881
and it is expressed naturally as a stencil operation.

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:09.644
We have computed this normalized cross-correlation square for you,

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:17.254
but if you're interested we will provide extra details about normalized cross-correlation in the Instructor Comments.

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:21.567
Our next step is to sort all of the pixels in the image

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.920
according to their score.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.257
Note that the pixels with the highest scores

00:01:26.257 --> 00:01:32.060
are the pixels that most likely belong to a red eye, as you can see here.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.206
This sorting step is what you will be implementing in problem set number 4.

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:39.699
If you are interested,

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:46.602
we will discuss several different types of optimization strategies for sorting in the Instructor Comments.

00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:51.900
Our final step is to reduce the redness of the high scoring pixels.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.332
This computation is expressed naturally as a map operation.

00:01:57.332 --> 00:02:02.621
Once again we've performed the step for you so you can concentrate your efforts on sorting.

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:07.491
That is all, good luck and I hope you will enjoy problem set number 4,

00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:10.895
and like the previous problem sets I want to thank Eric and Mike

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:14.731
for writing the code and the script to this problem set,

00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:17.364
so thank you.
