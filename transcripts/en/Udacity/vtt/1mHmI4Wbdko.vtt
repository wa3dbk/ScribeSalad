00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's go through one way to do it together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I find it helpful to draw the finite state machine first.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So here's my start state. We'll call it 1.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And because "q * " accepts the empty string, it also has to be an accepting state,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but I can see any number of q's that I like and still accept,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so it looks like we've got 1 state, 1 edge, and our state is also an accepting state.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So just to show that this program really works, we're going to run it in the interpreter.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Over here, I have defined edges, just as we suggested.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In state 1 on a 'q', you loop back to state 1.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
State 1 is our start state, and it's also our accepting state.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's try out our simulation on a bunch of q's, the empty string, and a bunch of q's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
with an evil interloper.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We've got this 'A' hiding here. This should be true. True. False.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Oh, and it is.

00:00:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So our finite state machine simulator matches our intuition exactly.
