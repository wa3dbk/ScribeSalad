00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.920
A variety of machine learning algorithms
can be used for intrusion detection.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.530
These include Bayesian networks.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.960
Bayesian networks encode the conditional
probabilities among observed events.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.000
For example,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.880
how likely an email is sent by a user
if the current time is 2:00 AM.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.510
If a low probability activity
takes place it is an anomaly.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.200
Markov models, a Markov model

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.119
is a set of states that are connected
by transitional probabilities.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.720
For example, Markov models can be used
to model legitimate website names

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.840
because, the traditional probabilities
from one letter to the next

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.770
should be similar to that of
real dictionary words because,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.160
users need to type the website names.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.010
On the other hand, a randomly spelled
website name is anomalous and

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.780
may be used by botnets for C and C, or

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.170
command control, because bots don't
have to type the website names.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.700
Neural networks.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.500
A neural network simulates how human
brain perform reasoning and learning.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.930
They are one of the most powerful
machine learning approaches.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.400
Clustering and outlier detection.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.400
Clustering groups the observed data into
clusters based on some similarity or

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.050
distance measure.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.370
And then identify subsequently observed
data as either belonging to a cluster or

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.690
as an outlier.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.820
For example,
traffic from the internal network

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
to the company's internal web
server have common characteristics

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.260
that can be grouped into clusters
based on the webpages visited.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.800
On the other hand, an attack may
access data on the web server

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.070
that's rarely visited,
which makes it an outlier.
