00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.700
Acute limitation of Anomaly Detection
is that it only uses normal or

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.780
legitimate data in training.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.050
That is,
there's no intrusion data involved.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.020
As a result, when an Anomaly Detection
model detects an anomaly,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.820
it may not be limited to an intrusion.
