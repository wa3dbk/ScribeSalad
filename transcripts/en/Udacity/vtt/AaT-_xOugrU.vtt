When you declare a variable, it's important that you give it an initial value.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.610
Look at this variable. It's name is rocketSpeed. It's type is called double.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.888
And I'll talk about what double means in just a minute. What I want to show you

00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:23.562
first is over here, the last part of the variable declaration. And that's the

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:27.700
initial value. And it really is important that you always supply an initial

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.294
value when you declare a variable. Because if you forget, and later use the

00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:39.674
rocketSpeed variable, that would be an error. Every variable that you used must

00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:44.885
really have a value. The best time to set the value is right when you declare

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:50.443
it. Now, back to the curious type double. That means it's a number that can

00:00:50.443 --> 00:00:55.110
have a decimal point, such as here, 24,724.573. So, when you see the word

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.110
double, you should simply think a number with a decimal point. And ignore the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.441
curious name. Now, look at this variable declaration. The name is

00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:16.821
sallyRidesBirthday, the type is the Day class, and the initial value looks like

00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:24.933
this. You will see soon exactly what this syntax means, but when you look at

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:30.540
it, it seems intuitively clear, we make a new Day object with a date 1951, May

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.539
26.
