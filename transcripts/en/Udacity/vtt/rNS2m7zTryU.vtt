So, the first thing we need to know is, what is canvas? Canvas is a new HTML5

00:00:04.627 --> 00:00:09.892
element which exposes APIs allowing you to draw graphs, images, and text

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:14.410
to portions of the page. A canvas only has two attributes specific to it, width and

00:00:14.422 --> 00:00:19.413
height, which specify what size this drawing surface is on your page. Since

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:24.255
canvas is effectively a large memory blob of pixel data, or bitmap for you

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:27.808
Yankees, it closely resembles the memory layouts that game developers have been

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.837
using for years to generate 2D games.
