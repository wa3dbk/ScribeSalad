00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.480
Hypothesis testing about the true population correlation is a type of t test.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.720
It uses the t distribution, and therefore, the t table that we discussed

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.055
earlier. This is the formula, but you don't need to use it. And the degrees of

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:19.895
freedom are N minus 2. You can understand this intuitively because we have n

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:25.922
values, n for each variable, and we subtract 1 per group. We just wanted to

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:29.518
show you this so that you see what it is, but in real life you'll use software

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:34.239
to run this test. The important thing is that you're able to interpret it, and

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.167
since you already know all about t tests, you know when to reject or fail to

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:42.114
reject the null. For example, let's say we're measuring the relationship

00:00:42.114 --> 00:00:48.312
between two variables. And we have 25 participants. And let's say we do a

00:00:48.312 --> 00:00:54.962
non-directional test at alpha equals 0.05. Let's say we get a t statistic equal

00:00:54.962 --> 00:01:01.506
to 2.71. What do we conclude there is or there is not enough evidence to reject

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:09.650
the null because there is or is not a significant relationship between x and y.
