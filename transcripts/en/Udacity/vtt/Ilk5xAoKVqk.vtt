00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The modern corporation as we know it was first formed in 1602

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with the government chartered Dutch East India Company.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is kind of the first modern corporation with shareholders and organizations

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that kind of if you squinted looked like something closed to modern companies today.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
By the 1850s in the United States with railroads spanning the entire country,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
corporations needed more sophisticated organizations

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the fact the first org chart was drawn in 1856 to just manage corporations

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and by the beginning of the 20th century, educators started realizing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that there was a need for an educated management class to administer and execute these corporations

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because at least in the United States we were going from local economies to regional economies

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to a national economy, yet we did not have a trained management class

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and so in a brilliant insight, Harvard set up the first masters of business administration course

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
called the MBA and the first graduating class in 1910 was the first of a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
cadre of business administrators that made the 20th century the modern corporate century.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The MBA curriculum is designed to provide managers and administrators

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
with the tools they needed to run existing and growing companies.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Accounting, strategy, operations, leadership, organizational behavior,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
human resources management and these stack of tools were just incredibly important

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
for the growth of large companies but what's really interesting what that missed is that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
they were really no tools provided in this curriculum for starting new businesses.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
One of the things we did not understand for 100 years

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is that startups are not smaller versions of large companies.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Let me say it again--startups are not smaller versions of large companies

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and what falls out of that is all the traditional tools taught and learned in an MBA curriculum

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
are irrelevant in the first chaotic year or two of an early stage venture.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Eventually, you need that tool set but at first it really gets in the way.
