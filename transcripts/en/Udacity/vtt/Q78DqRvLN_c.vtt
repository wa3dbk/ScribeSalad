The importance of sleep is often overlooked. A lot of us think that we can get

00:00:03.385 --> 00:00:07.484
by on minimal sleep. However, we know that there are serious negative effects

00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:10.876
to our mental and physical health, as well as our overall quality of life, and

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:16.256
our safety. For example the National Center for Sleep Disorder Research noted

00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:21.356
that thousands of car accidents are caused by drowsy driving. They also note

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:25.992
that losing one to two hours of sleep per night can result in depression. Now,

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.310
these are important things that we need to consider the next time one of us

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.390
wants to pull an all nighter, right?
