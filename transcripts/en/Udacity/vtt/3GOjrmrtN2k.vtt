00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.335
My answers would be that
the advantage is that providers

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:07.510
are more likely to participate,
since it's at their site.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.040
And securing the data is
obviously simplified,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.130
since it doesn't leave their site.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.120
My disadvantage is the need to deal
with the specifics of each EHR.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.540
This is, essentially, the curly
braces problem, yet, once again.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.750
And the need to update the on site
software should that EHR design change,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.750
which often happens.
