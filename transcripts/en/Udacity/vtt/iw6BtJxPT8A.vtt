00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first reason, I think, is that it's because the developers of the commercial software systems

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
aren't doing it or at least not doing it enough and I think it's pretty clear that the kind of bugs found,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for example, in the fuzzing papers, or in Charlie Miler's talk would'nt have been there in the software

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
if the developers of Adobe Acrobat or the Unix utilities have

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
had a reasonably aggressive random testing program, and remember that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
some of those bugs Charlie Norris was talking about were secured liabilities.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
These are things that they really don't want in their software, and so what I'd argue--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Software development efforts that don't make proper use of random testing are flawed,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the reason that these efforts are flawed is because

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
modern software systems are so large and so complicated

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that test cases produced by nonrandom processes are simply unlikely to find

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the kind of bugs that are lurking in these software systems.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What that leaves us with is a question: what should they have done?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
How is random testing supposed to work? Let me give some ideas about that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What I'm going to do here is show sort of a rough software development timeline

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
with a releasing software over here and early development stages over here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What we've looked at mainly so far in this course is random unit testing.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We're developing these software units and what we're trying to do is make sure that they are robust enough.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then we start composing them together later, they'll be a solid foundation.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We looked at several cases of, for example, with a queue--bounded queue here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We looked at fuzzing the interfaces that it provides.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We also looked at an example of random fault injection and that was for the read_all function,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and if you remember, that was the function that was supposed

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to cope with the fact that the Unix read system call can display partial success.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
They were doing fault injections that were fuzzing the interface used

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
by the read_all call not the interface that it provides.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And so, like I said, what we want to do is ensure as we're developing the modules

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that we're creating robust pieces of software whose interfaces we understand

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and that are going to be solid foundation for future work,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
so I would start developing more elaborate software stacks.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It's going to be the case that some of our random testers become useless.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
For example, if we have a Q instantiated here that is used by some

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
more sophisticated piece of software, we no longer are interested in the ability to randomly test

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the interface provided by the Q because it's simply being used by the rest of the software.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
On the other hand, other kinds of random testers such as those that come in at the top level

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and those that perform system-level fault injection are absolutely still useful.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In fact, fault injection of things like erroneous responses to system calls

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
are really important things to test larger pieces of software with

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because typically, those kind of errors can result in failures propagating

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
all the way through our software stack and we'd really like to understand

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
how our system responds to that sort of thing.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
To be part of something that's more of a complete product

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
our focus should be on external interfaces provided, so this is going to be things like

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
file I/O and the graphical user interface, and so, if you recall those fuzzing papers,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we're fuzzing exactly these sorts of things.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Here, we're delivering random bits to the file interface and they were delivering

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
random gooey events to applications and knocking over

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
a pretty large proportion of applications that they tested.
