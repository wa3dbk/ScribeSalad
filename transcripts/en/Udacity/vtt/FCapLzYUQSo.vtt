00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.040
And one of the reasons why a bar chart like this is very good at

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.730
highlighting this missing data that's strict rigidity of the chart layout.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.170
Evenly spaced bars, with evenly spaces widths for each bar.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.990
The only variable we're working with in this case is the height of a bar.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.640
So if we had fairly regular and periodic data,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.580
it becomes very apparent to a reader when a single periodic event doesn't occur.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.840
But it would also say that this is one of the failings of

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.990
the bar chart for our data.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.780
One fundamental reason why the bar chart in our case doesn't work is that

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.310
the x axis is an intrinsically ordered variable.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.740
Year 1932 comes before 1933, comes before 1934, and so forth.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.010
A bar chart is typically best suited to represent categorical data where

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.440
these might be things like labels or groups, such as a state.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.920
For example in our case might be the country or

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.380
continent in which the World Cup was held in.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.100
And while years could be considered discreet values.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.470
1932 can be thought of as a category in some sense.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.120
There's a natural order to time, which makes a bar chart suboptimal.
