00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.236
&gt;&gt; Now that you've calculated the standard deviation by hand, we can finally do

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:08.365
it with spreadsheets. And that's what we're going to do from now on. Open the

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:12.728
spreadsheet called Sample Social Networkers Salary. The link should be at the

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:16.664
right. This has 100 data values and you're going to calculate the standard

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:21.302
deviation. You'll have to copy this into your own spreadsheet. To guide you,

00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:26.662
I've listed instructions, and they have numbers that signify the order in which

00:00:26.662 --> 00:00:32.048
you should do them. So first find the average of these values. Then you find the

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:37.234
deviation. Then you square each deviation. Then you find the average squared

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:42.422
deviation. And then finally, you take the square root. And this is the standard

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:47.075
deviation. Once you've calculated the standard deviation, enter it here.
