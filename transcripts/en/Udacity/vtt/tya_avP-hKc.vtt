Have you ever had the winter blues? Where you're just depressed during the

00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:08.698
winter? For some people, this is an actual recognized disorder called seasonal

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.016
affective disorder. This applies to any season. Throughout most of the year,

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:17.433
people with SAD have normal mental health, but experience depression during

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:22.624
certain seasons, even, Even spring or summer. Researchers tried to figure out

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:28.055
how to treat SAD. 95 people were randomly assigned to one of three conditions.

00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:33.777
Bright light therapy which is where participants were exposed to 10,000 lux for

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.166
30 minutes every morning From 6 o'clock until 6:30 a.m.

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:44.711
Lux is the international standard measurement of illuminance. The second group

00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:51.133
received dawn simulation, which was a dawn signal in which people were exposed

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:57.338
to lux that peaked at 250. And this lasted 1.5 hours, and the third was a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.901
placebo condition, which was just 1.5 hours of a dim red light at only .5 lux.

00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:07.376
This lasted from 4:30AM until 6:00AM.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.218
The number of people in each group was as follows, 33 in the bright light, 31 in

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.211
the dawn simulation, and 31 in the placebo. After six weeks, all the subjects

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:26.129
were blindly rated by a psychiatrist. So the psychiatrist did not know which

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:31.479
treatment each person was exposed to. The psychiatrist uses the structured

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:36.017
interview guide for the Hamilton Depression ration for seasonal affective

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:40.747
disorder. This measures a person's level of this type of depression on a scale

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.544
of 0 to 89, with higher numbers indicating greater severity of depression. The

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:50.216
researchers found that dawn simulation was associated with greater recovery.

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:54.405
That is compared to the placebo group and the bright light therapy group.
