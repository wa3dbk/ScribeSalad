00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.573
Here is another equation. 3 over x minus 1 over the quantity 5x is equal to 7.

00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:09.090
Again, we have choices about what to do first. I'm going to say that I'd like

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.482
our first step this time to be to combine the two fractions over here on the

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:18.009
left hand side. We can see that x is involved in both these fractions, so it

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.169
seems like a pretty logical first step to take to me. So if we decide to do

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.390
that, what should we make the denominator of the single fraction we'll have here

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.051
on the left side? Make sure that this is the least common denominator we could

00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:30.359
have.
