00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.868
Let's look at another simplification process involving negative exponents. I'm

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:07.348
going to show you two ways of doing this problem, and then you can pick which

00:00:07.348 --> 00:00:11.071
one you prefer. We learned before that a base with a negative exponent can be

00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:15.402
moved to the denominator. So we'll have 1 divided by 2 cubed times 2 squared, or

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:19.154
1 divided by 2 to the 5th. If this gives you some trouble, try applying your

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:23.495
exponent rules directly. We know when we divide bases, we subtract the

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:28.383
exponents. So we have 2 to the negative 2 minus 3, negative 2 minus 3 equals

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:33.497
negative 5. And finally we have a base with a negative exponent, so we move the

00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:38.879
base to the denominator with a positive exponent. Leaving us with 1 divided by 2

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.608
to the 5th. And that's exactly the same as we got before.
