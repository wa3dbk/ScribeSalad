00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What's the time of sunset tomorrow? For sure, we can answer that by simulation.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We already simulated the motion of the moon around the earth

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and in the similar way, we can simulate the motion of the earth around the sun

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the rotation of the earth.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Are dolphins more intelligent than elephants?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
To answer this question by simulation which we try our model of how intelligence develops

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and depends on biology, that is pretty hard to do and may be impossible.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Can neutrinos travel faster than light? That's something that physicists have to measure.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You could imagine the model that contains more fundamental objects than neutrinos

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
super strings for instance and the neutrinos could be simulated using super strings,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but that's again far from the current state of the art and may be impossible.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Who invented the telephone?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
To answer that question, you would have to model all of human history inside the computer

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That doesn't sound plausible.
