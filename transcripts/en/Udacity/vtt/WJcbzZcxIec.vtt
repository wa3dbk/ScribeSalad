00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Using the maximum-likelihood estimator MLE that we just discussed and here are my answers.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
1 was observed in 1 out of 10 experiments, gives us 0.1--1 divided 10.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
2 was observed twice 0.2, 3, 4 and 5 was observed once each,

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and 6 was observed four times, one, two, three and four, is a 0.4.
