00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:04.278
You probably already know that computers
represent numbers in binary, or

00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:05.516
base two internally.

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:10.031
The value of computer memory is
literally represented as a sequence of 1

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:10.851
and 0 bits.

00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:14.361
But when you're writing code in
a language like Python or JavaScript,

00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:16.183
you don't normally see the binary.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:19.383
Numeric values are normally
displayed in decimal, and

00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:22.989
other values such as strings or
Booleans hide the actual binary

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.200
representation away from
the programmer and the user.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.170
The letter a can be encoded as 01100001.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.958
But you don't need to know
that to print the word apple.

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.881
The binary representation is
available to you when you need it.

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:43.751
But IP addresses are one of those places
that the binary becomes a little bit

00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:44.764
more obvious.

00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:48.309
All of the information that's
transmitted over a network link travels

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.088
in the form of a long stream of bits.

00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:53.344
It's divided up into
messages called packets, and

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:57.118
each packet carries with it the IP
addresses of the sender and

00:00:57.118 --> 00:01:00.375
the recipient, and
these are each a binary number.

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:04.497
An IP address is a 32-bit value or
4 bytes.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:08.349
Networking people will often said that
it's four octets instead of bytes

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:11.402
because some old computers
use different sizes of bytes.

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:14.781
An octet is specifically eight bits.

00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:19.602
This binary or this hexadecimal
representation make up the same IP

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:24.350
address that in decimal
we write as 241.10.27.53.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.986
Writing the bytes or
octets separated with dots makes them

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:32.228
a lot easier to read, than if we
ran them together in plain decimal.

00:01:32.228 --> 00:01:36.631
Besides IP addresses, we'll see several
other binary values that occur in

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.464
packets which have different lengths and
bits.

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:45.200
In networking, the width of a field
tells how many bits are in that field.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.360
We'll say, for instance,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.677
that an IPv4 address has a bit
width of 32 or it's 32-bits wide.

00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:55.545
Meaning 32 bits are used
to represent that value.
