00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.950
Now we talked about what the trusted
computing base has to do.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.010
Whether we take the security
kernel approach or we don't but

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.680
we largely sort of focused
on what it has to do.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.570
When we say revisiting assurance,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.310
what we're really talking about
is how well does it do that?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.040
As the example we used before,
somebody's trying to sell you

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.170
an operating system, which is as we said
is the defector trusted computing base.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.820
And they're making all kinds of
claims about how trusted it is.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.930
When we say we want to get a sense
of the level of assurance,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.270
somebody has to sort of convince us.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.510
So let's just sort of quickly
talk about a couple of sort of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.238
ways in which assurance can be provided.

00:00:41.238 --> 00:00:45.990
One thing they can do is saying
you know we did implement it is

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.990
a software system but we extensively,
thoroughly tested it.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.480
So testing is normal testing.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.470
You do it for right functionality,
things like that.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.650
But there's also also pen testing or
penetration testing.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.450
Penetration testing basically refers to
sort of you come with the adversarial

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.070
mindset, saying what vulnerabilities
can I discover in this system?

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.020
If you can, better is to actually
have a proof that cannot be refuted.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.780
So you have a formal verification.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.040
It's a theorem that we prove saying this
is what my system is supposed to do and

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.620
here you can check that it does
exactly that and nothing else.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.190
Other things we can do is, you know,
some sort of a checking that developers

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.860
have actually implemented all
the requirements that we had.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.955
And we talked about a bunch of different
functions that are trusted computing

00:01:37.955 --> 00:01:41.080
base or have requirements for
a trusted computing base.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.290
So, when it comes to assurance and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.630
it comes to testing,
a word of caution here.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.540
We should look into what exactly does
testing give us in terms of assurance.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.410
So remember, testing is good for
showing that there is a problem.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.810
Testing obviously cannot
demonstrate absence of a problem.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.600
You can't say, well I ran all these
tests, so there are no problems.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.538
Tests can only demonstrate
problems that you can find.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:09.979
And the variety of testing,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.230
the testing is something that we do
fairly frequently in the software

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.000
development process, in the QA process,
Quality Assessment process.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.110
And one kind of testing, for example,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.730
is regression testing that
says when we enhance a system,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.650
add features to it, patch it, well it's
a new system, it's a different system.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.900
So regression testing says, you run
the test that we have to make sure that

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.650
these alterations that we did or
these changes that you made

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.720
don't break functionality or
it could improve performance.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.900
However, the key take away from here is
really the first two bullets which is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.380
testing is important.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.630
It's useful to discover problems.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.120
If you've done a lot of testing,
it increases your level of assurance or

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.950
confidence, but
of course it doesn't guarantee that

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.670
there are no more problems that
may be left with the system.
