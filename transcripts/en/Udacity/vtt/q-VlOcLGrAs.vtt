00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.170
So what the last one?

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.469
&gt;&gt; So we're going to do in the last one.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.200
I probably shouldn't go through
all the grungy details.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.340
Though all the all the pieces that you
need for this have been stuff that I've

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.300
said but what we're trying to do now is
represent this value function vaz of t.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.612
Applied to belief state B and we said
that was going to be basically a dot

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:20.810
product of the belief state with
some kind of reward vector for

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.970
the current action plus a weighted
version of the value function for

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.040
the previous time step.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.700
So it's going to be helpful to
actually take the value function of

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.530
the previous time step and
write it out more explicitly.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.480
So this is basically just
expanding on the definition

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.885
of the state estimator that
we did in the previous slide.

00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:39.880
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; We're going to say that the value

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.120
according to the t minus one
time step value function.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.090
For the belief state that we
get from taking action a,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.570
and making observation
z from belief state b.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.650
We can write this out as the maximum.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.940
Overall vectors in that set of
the dot product of that vector with

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.510
the resulting belief state which we had
previously derived to have this form.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.820
Okay, the observation function times
the transition function times the belief

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.830
state and then normalized and this
normalization factor is the probability

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.170
of making the observation z given that
we are in belief state band action a.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.180
This is a highly non-linear function but

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.280
this is the awesome part ready, since
we're going to ultimately multiply this

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.350
value function times the probability
that z is the actual observation.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.530
In other words probability
of z given b comma a.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.810
This and this end up canceling and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.120
we're left with is an actual
linear transformation.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.360
So this this weird divide by thing that
actually makes things really yucky

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.150
cancels itself out.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.880
So convenient.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.535
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just like life.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:46.546
&gt;&gt; Not usually, but math sometimes does
this for us and so at the end of the day

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:50.300
we end up with a quantity that is a dot
product with the belief state and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.985
another quantity that is a dot
product with the belief state.

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:56.105
We can factor out the belief state and

00:01:56.105 --> 00:02:02.000
what it leaves us with is a giant vector
one for each combination of observation,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.250
action, and which gamma is going to
be the maximum at that observation.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.280
So we actually have to
take the product of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.350
the number of vectors that was
in the t minus one set raised

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.900
to the number of observations
times the number of actions.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.370
And that's going to be the maximum
size of the set that we get for

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.330
representing the t step value function.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.950
So like you said, could could blow up.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.980
But still finite.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.610
Can't block to be infinite
if it started out as finite.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.260
&gt;&gt; Nice, so that feels like
a prove with induction to me.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.470
&gt;&gt; Great, okay and so
you wouldn't want to actually do this.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.640
There is code in burlap for
doing a lot of these processes,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.540
there's also my
collaborator Tony Cassandra

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.510
created a program called POMDP-solve
that you can download that does all

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.420
these calculations carefully and,
you know, on your behalf.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.070
So I didn't really want to get this
to the point where you could actually

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.600
necessarily code all this up, just
to believe that it's code upable and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.730
you can use an existing implementation
If you want to actually run.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.330
&gt;&gt; It very mathematical of you.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.830
So there's one more step before
we can get something that I mean

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.280
you can actually implemented this way
but this is guaranteed to be exponential

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.540
because you're actually combining
all these things together.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.130
There's one step that we can
do that if it's the case

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.190
that the Q functions have
a small representation.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.500
Then the algorithm will run quickly.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.220
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.290
&gt;&gt; Here, it could be that the Q
functions are actually very very big.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.630
In case it's not obvious, the Q
functions are represented right there.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I called it va sub t.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.550
But that's really the Q function.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.560
&gt;&gt; I like it.
I like it.
