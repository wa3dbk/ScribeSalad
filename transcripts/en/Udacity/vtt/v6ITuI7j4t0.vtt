00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.330
Let's take a look at the GIF editor view
controller in the Objective C project.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.640
We can see that it has three properties.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.020
A GIF image view, a GIF, and then in
the .m file a caption text field.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.520
If we look through
the implementation file.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.750
We see the view controller
lifecycle methods.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.870
We see a bunch of code for
formatting the caption text field.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.380
We see the UI text field
delegate methods, the code for

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.285
adjusting the keyboard.

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:32.755
And then a method
called present preview.

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:37.455
Okay, here we are back in the GIF editor
view controller in the SWIFT project and

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.635
we'll start by adding those properties.

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:42.500
We already have a property for
the GIF image view.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.040
So we need to add a property for

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.060
the caption text field which we
can drag in from storyboard.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.400
And we'll replace this GIF URL
property with a property called GIF.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.560
And we're not really sure when this
GIF property's going to be set.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.740
So we'll make it an optional.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.430
Next you're going to want to
go back to the method,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.650
convert video to GIF, this is in the UI
view controller record extension.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.360
Now, instead of passing the GIF URL
from the convert video to GIF method,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.000
let's go ahead and
initialize an instance of the GIF and

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.170
then instead of passing the GIF URL.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.900
We'll just pass the GIF as a parameter
to the display GIF method, and

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.820
then we'll go back to our GIF
editor view controller and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.700
set the GIF image view
in view will appear.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.060
So instead of GIF from recording.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.960
It should be gif.gifimage.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.400
Now let's run it and see how it looks.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.830
This will also tell us if everything
is in order with our GIF class.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.430
All right, okay.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.800
Let's launch the camera.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.120
Whoa!

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.600
Super we can still see our GIF.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.500
So it looks like everything's
in order with the GIF class.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.420
Hopefully you will be
able to see your GIF too.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.040
And now we'll move on to implement
the UITextField delegate methods.
