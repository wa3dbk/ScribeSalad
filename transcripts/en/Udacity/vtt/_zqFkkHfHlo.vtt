00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.250
We just demonstrated some powerful LLDB
commands and each of the commands is now

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.510
another tool that you can use when
your paused at a break point.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.720
I hope you're beginning to see a pattern
in how we can use break points and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.840
tools together.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.570
That is, that we can set breakpoints,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.420
and then we can get our apps
to reach break points, and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.370
then we can use tools to examine our
applications while they're paused.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.020
But there are also some other
interesting ways that we can

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.800
edit the very nature of a breakpoint so

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.020
that it doesn't necessarily
pause an application.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.860
For example,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.540
we can modify breakpoints so that they
only pause in certain circumstances,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.570
like only pause after the 10th bug is
created, instead of just the first bug.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.450
Or we can make breakpoints that
don't pause the applications at all,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.580
instead they can perform
some behavior and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.450
then just let the application
continue running.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.230
For instance, don't pause, play a sound.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.520
To achieve these kinds of behaviors,
we'll use breakpoint actions, and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.280
specifically that's what
breakpoint actions are,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.880
they're behaviors that are triggered
when a breakpoint is reached.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.060
So to demonstrate, I'm going to start
in the breakpoint navigator and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.349
right now we have no breakpoints.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:10.220
I've removed the ones that we had, but
let's add one for the add bug to view.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.070
There we go, so now it shows up.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.960
And if we right click a breakpoint,
then a context menu pops up and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.470
we can select this option
to edit the breakpoint.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.210
And here's where the fun happens.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.660
But before we add and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.040
action or a breakpoint action,
let's work with the other fields first.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.460
So we see this condition field at
the top and this allows up to specify

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.458
a condition that must be true in
order for a breakpoint to be active.

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:40.490
For this breakpoint let's specify
that the count of the bug's array

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.850
must be greater than three before
the breakpoint is triggered.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.247
And to do this,
I'll type in the expression

00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:52.260
bugs.count is greater than three,
and we'll hit enter.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.358
And let's go ahead and
run the application.

00:01:55.087 --> 00:01:59.335
And stopped.

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:06.770
If we look down in bugs, we can
see that we have four image views.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.540
So the bugs are greater than three and
our breakpoint has now been triggered.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.300
So let's stop this and go back and
edit our breakpoint again.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.162
And I'll clear the condition and

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:21.632
this time let's set the ignore
times before stopping value.

00:02:21.632 --> 00:02:28.700
We'll make it two and rerun the app,
tap the screen, and there we go.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.630
It ignored it the first two times,
and created two bugs, and now

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.570
we're on the third iteration through,
and about to create our third bug.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.200
Let's stop this one more time.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.850
Go back to the breakpoint navigator and
edit again.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.860
So we'll make sure this is zero and
this time let's select this check box

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.016
that says, automatically continue
after evaluating actions.

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:55.810
I'll run this again and when we click,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.630
it appears that the break
point has been skipped.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.960
However, that's not exactly the case.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.080
It only looks like
the breakpoint's being skipped.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.632
What's happening, is because there
are no break point actions specified,

00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:08.500
the breakpoint was triggered, but

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.640
then immediately evaluated
zero actions and continued.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.580
So if we add an action,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.336
we can prove that something
else should have happened.

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:19.000
So we'll click edit and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.320
the first action type that we'll look
at is the debug or command action.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.980
This includes a text field for entering
any valid commands that we could use

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.950
at the LLDB command line interface.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.365
So we'll do our PO command we saw
earlier, print out bugs, then run.

00:03:34.365 --> 00:03:38.030
Then we can see that it's evaluating,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.970
it's evaluating a lot because we're
creating a lot of bugs, but then it

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.390
should just fall through our breakpoint,
it has never paused our application.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.900
It is taking more time to
actually execute though

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.150
because it has to run the actions.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.720
So we can really see our problem now

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.300
because with one tap way more than
one bug was being created, and

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.150
we kept seeing the contents of
this update over and over again.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.880
So let's stop and see if we can
see this problem another way.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.480
So go back and edit.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.730
And this time we're going to
add a new breakpoint action, so

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.110
we click the plus and
let's choose sound and

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.140
we'll keep it this default
bottle sound and run again.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.685
Let me turn on,
make sure we can hear this.

00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:27.940
[SOUND] And now,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.955
we can hear the problem too.

00:04:33.955 --> 00:04:38.872
So each time a bug was added to the
view, the breakpoint was triggered and

00:04:38.872 --> 00:04:40.670
our sound played.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.600
And you can actually even add your
custom sounds instead of the default

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.840
ones, and I've included a link in the
instructor notes if you're interested.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.430
So let's stop this one more time and

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.876
talk about the remaining actions
that we haven't looked at yet.

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:56.490
I'm not going to show examples for
each of the actions because some of them

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.250
are outside the scope of this class but
there are additional

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.110
resources in the instructor notes that
can guide you through using them.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.220
So in the breakpoint editor, which we
see here, we'll add one more action.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.850
And here at the top, we see AppleScript.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.470
And what an AppleScript action is
going to allow you to do is run

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.240
an AppleScript's script
when the breakpoint is hit.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.440
The next one is capture a GPU frame,
and this does exactly what it says,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.480
and it can be useful if you're
debugging applications using OpenGL or

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.260
something like that, using SpriteKit.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.630
Then we have the log message, which will
either log a message to the console,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.730
or we can actually speak it back to us
but I'll admit that having the computer

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.160
speak back to you can feel
a little bit like Space Odyssey.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.480
And then the last action
is the Shell command.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.670
And similar to the AppleScript action,

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.620
this allows you to run a shell script
when the breakpoint is reached.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.420
One way this can be really useful is for
an app that might need

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.640
to clear the local database records each
time the app is run in the simulator.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.500
So instead of doing this manually,
you can set a breakpoint and

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.200
actually run a script that clears
the local database for you.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.050
And really, there are endless
possibilities with what you could do

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.420
with this, so I'd encourage you to
experiment with them in your own

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.840
projects, and if you like, there's
another cool thing we can do here.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.070
We can actually share
our breakpoints too.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.840
So if you right click any
breakpoint in the navigator and

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.531
you select share breakpoint,
then it'll now show up as shared, and

00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:33.570
the breakpoint will be included as
part of your Xcode project file.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.140
And this means that you can share your
Xcode project with anyone else, and they

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.970
should see the breakpoint, and because
the shared breakpoint is recorded

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.280
as part of a file, then it'll also show
up in version control systems like Git.
