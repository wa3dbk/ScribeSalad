00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.300
The gating values for each gate get

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.680
controlled by a tiny logistic
regression on the input parameters.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.060
Each of them has its own
set of shared parameters.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.180
And there's an additional hyperbolic
tension sprinkled in here

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.600
to keep the outputs between -1 and 1.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.220
It looks complicated but
once you write down the math

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.018
It's literally five lines of code,
as you'll see in the assignment.

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:27.930
And it's well-behaved, continues,
and differentiable all the way,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.360
which means we can optimize
those parameters very easily.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.610
So why do LSTMs work?

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.710
Without going into too many details,
all these little gates help the model

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.870
keep its memory longer when it needs to,
and ignore things when it should.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.010
As a result,
the optimization is much easier, and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.090
the gradient vanishing, vanishes.
