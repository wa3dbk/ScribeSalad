00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.220
I said at the start that OCL had constraints, it had collection classes, and

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.850
have navigation. Let's say, let's talk for a minute about the navigation aspect.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.630
I also said that OCL typically is associated with a particular class model

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.190
diagram. And when you remember that the, each of the OCL constraints has

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.300
a context clause that says which class or operation you are starting with.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.440
Well, it's certainly a value to be able to give constraints on the instances of

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.910
a particular class. But it's even more powerful to be able to say, that several

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.436
classes are related in certain ways. That means, that in your constraints, you

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:42.888
need to not only be able to specify the attributes of the, the context class.

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:48.370
But the attributes of other classes, as well. Okay? Well, how do you do that?

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.740
In OCL, there's the concept of navigation, which allows you to

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.940
essentially walk your way through the diagram. And every time you take a step,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.940
you add the period and the name of the next class or relationship along the way.
