00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.830
Vendors become certified through
a formal testing process developed by

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.150
the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, or NIST for short.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.620
The actual testing is administered
by one of several companies who have

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.560
contracted with NIST to do it.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.310
We'll now take a closer look at that
using one of the required items for

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.930
data collection.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.030
You should recall that a certified EHR
must maintain a current problem list.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.700
But what does that mean?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.160
Medical problems are usually coded
in a global data standard called

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.290
the international classification
of disease, or ICD for short.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.540
A vendor can demonstrate
that they meet this criteria

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.990
by showing the EA chart can
store test ICD test codes and

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.266
supplement them with problem status and
date diagnosed.

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:50.890
The testing would include the asking
the vendor change your problem status.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.510
For example, from active to resolved and
demonstrating that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.690
this change is posted and displayed in
appropriate places throughout their EHR.
