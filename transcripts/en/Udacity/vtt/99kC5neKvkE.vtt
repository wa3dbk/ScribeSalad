00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.790
The results of correlational studies give us what is called a correlation

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.350
coefficient. Correlations tell us two things, the strength of the relationship

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.080
as well as the direction of the relationship. Here, we have our X variable,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.920
which is our predictor variable. And our Y variable, which is our criterion

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.760
variable, or what is to be explained. In our study the X variable was the

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.500
number and type of chores, whereas the Y variable was the number of sexual

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.090
encounters. For the strength of relationship, we can have a positive

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.040
relationship. We can also have a negative relationship. Here, in a negative

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.560
correlation, as scores increase on the X variable, they decrease on the Y

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.760
variable. In a positive correlationship, as scores increase on the X variable

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.920
they also increase on the Y variable. This would be an example of a perfect

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.488
positive correlation: plus 1. Here, we have an example of a perfect negative

00:00:56.488 --> 00:01:01.290
correlation: minus 1. In the middle, we can see that our data points are

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.050
randomly distributed. This would indicate no relationship. In our example,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.820
there would be no relationship between the number of sexual encounters and the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.060
type of chores. Here, we see a moderate positive correlation. Here, we see a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.320
moderate negative correlation. Again strength and direction of relationships

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.539
are explained in correlational studies.
