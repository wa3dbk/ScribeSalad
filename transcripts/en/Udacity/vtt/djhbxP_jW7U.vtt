Flipping a coin is the best option because it's random. So, the logic here is

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.020
that there's a million different variables that can effect somebody's reaction

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.340
time. Whether you're old or young, male or female or how much you slept last

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.220
night. All of these things may or may not influence reaction time, but these

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.800
aren't the variables we're interested in.
