00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.266
For the following example, determine where the primary appraisal and the

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:08.860
secondary appraisal is. LaShonda did poorly on a quiz and became frustrated.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.870
She had an immediate negative emotional response. However, after thinking more

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.946
carefully about the situation she realized two important things. First, she

00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:21.456
realized that it was better to receive a poor grade for just one assignment and

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:26.598
not the entire class. Second, she realized she did not appropriately estimate

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:31.168
how much studying would be necessary to do well on the quiz. So she knows that

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:35.488
in the future she needs to allocate more time to studying to do well on her

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:40.970
quizzes. Type which part of this example you think is a primary appraisal, and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.250
which part of the example is a secondary appraisal, in the respective boxes
