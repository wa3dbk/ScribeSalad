00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:04.016
Line C, in the following graph, represents how performance scales

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:07.880
on a particular GPU on a CUDA application,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.816
as a function of the number of blocks launched.

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:15.560
Assume this application is strongly compute bound,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.959
whereas computation is the performance bottleneck for this problem.

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:24.295
If we run this application on a different GPU

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:30.440
with twice as many SMs or in other words, cores,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.377
which curve best represents the performance you might see?

00:00:35.377 --> 00:00:39.377
Please fill in the box with either A, B, C, D or E.
