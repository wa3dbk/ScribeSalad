00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here is a die with six possible outcomes.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's assume you've got the following data sequence for 10 different experiments, and now

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we're going to apply the same method to compute the probabilities of the six different outcomes.

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please enter them the six cubes over there.
