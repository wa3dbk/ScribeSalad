00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.580
In order to resist collision attacks,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.340
the length of hash should
be at least 128 bits.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.100
Secure hash function processes
a message block by block and

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.940
produces an intermediate hash value.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.100
HMAC hashes a message with a secret key.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.920
It is a standard way to provide
message authentication.
