00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.810
So, passwords are hashed. Are you completely safe? No. Sorry to

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.880
lead you down this path. We have, we have more to

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.250
do. The problem is, there are, you know, a handful of

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.250
good hashing algorithms that people would use for this sort of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.890
thing. You know, let's, let's, let's pretend we're using SHA-256, because

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.620
that's a pretty decent algorithm. If somebody were to go through

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.740
and create a mapping of every word to the hash of

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.920
that word. That would be a problem. because remember the whole strength

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.340
of this hashing problem is that it's really hard to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.700
get from the hash to the plain text that led to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.490
that hash. You know, to, if you have H of a,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.110
you know, the hash of a. It's really hard to figure

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.420
out a. But if you've got already computed it for every

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.720
word, and all you have to do is you know compute

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.860
at once and create the inverse table. Once somebody has this

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.007
table of all this words computed once, they're done. You know,

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:53.604
if you created a mapping of you know the SHA-256 of

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.148
every word to the original word, all of a sudden you get,

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:59.115
you get a database of a bunch of SHA-256 passwords. You can

00:00:59.115 --> 00:01:02.620
look up what the password is instantly. And this table has a

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.560
name. It's called a rainbow table. There are these things, these mappings,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.330
these databases of a hash version of a password to the clear

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.440
text password, they exist. You can Google for a rainbow table for

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340
a hash algorithm of your choice, you know, download that hash table

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.760
or, you know, download that mapping, turn it into a hash table and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.160
you're good to go. There's a very simple way to get around this. You

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.970
may remember from our cookie approach, that all we have to do is

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.840
add in some secrets. But we don't want to add in the same secret over

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.170
and over again. Otherwise, you're basically

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.970
vulnerable to the same fairly similar technique.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.390
So what we do instead is we use something called a salt. So in

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.370
our user table, we're storing our name, and we're storing a hash of

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.870
the password. Instead of storing just a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.350
hash of the password, we're going to add.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.560
A secret to it. It's similar to how we

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.620
did with the cookies except this is not really secret.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.920
We're just going to say this hash is going to equal our

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.160
hashing function of the password plus salt. And this

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.890
salt, instead of, so this looks very similar to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.640
what we did with the cookies. Right? We were using

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.200
HMAC and, and we had a password, and, and a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.610
secret. Except the salt is just. It's just some random

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.490
characters we make up. You can make them up

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.040
and you store them in the hash field, in the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.840
clear. So, in this field, we'll, we'll actually have

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.010
the hash. Now this abbreviated as H and right along

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.890
with it we'll have the salt and what this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.230
does is, is this prevents this quick lookup from working

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.680
because all of a sudden we've added this these random

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.560
strings. So, instead of saying hash of a equals a,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.590
we have to figure out what's, well what's hash of

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.540
a you know, plus the salt. And all of a sudden

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.990
that table's completely invalid. So, when you store a user. You

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.040
know this is the type of algorithm you can do. Now,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.360
outside of this class I want you to think very hard

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.100
about doing this yourself. You know as with all crypto you

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.920
should probably not being implementing it yourself because people have thought

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.640
this through. They have done it securely and you are not

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910
yet qualified to do so. I want you to think very

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.708
hard. About using third party libraries, because a lot of third party

00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:08.485
libraries also get this wrong. So, basically, think very hard. You

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:11.855
want to get this right. There's a couple more things I'll tell you

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:14.452
to look for when you're evaluating a third party library, but

00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:16.706
a lot of them really screw this up, and you don't want to

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:19.891
just trust them blindly, so. You know, I'd rather you do

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:22.663
it yourself knowing how to do it than you trust a third

00:03:22.663 --> 00:03:25.372
party library blindly, but the best knowledge you

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.884
can have is what to look for in

00:03:26.884 --> 00:03:29.380
a third party authentication library. Let's go ahead

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.970
and implement some naive functions for, you know, hashing

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.200
and salting a password so you can see how the, the flow works. And then we'll

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.890
talk about some of the things you should

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.936
look for when you're evaluating you know somebody's approach.
