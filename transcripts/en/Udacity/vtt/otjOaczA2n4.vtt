00:00:00.774 --> 00:00:04.458
Now in the beginning of this unit I did a little magic trick

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:06.976
having to do with coloring in region in a map.

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:11.227
This problem is sometimes called map coloring.

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:15.658
and just to remind you, the idea there is that each of the region in the map

00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:20.258
we're going to assign some color to it with the constraint that there can't be

00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:24.059
the same color in two adjacent regions on the map.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.675
because then it would kind of make it look like one big region.

00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:31.692
We can actually think of this as a problem

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:38.060
on graphs. In particular, we're going to make each region on the map correspond to a node on the graph

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.708
and we're going to connect two nodes on the graph if they share a border and therefore can't

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:45.643
have the same color on the map.

00:00:45.643 --> 00:00:48.042
"a" shares a border with "b" and "f"

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:52.976
"f" shares borders with "g", "b", and "a"

00:00:52.976 --> 00:00:55.976
"b" shares borders with "a" and "f" that we haven't

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:59.143
already and "g" and "c"

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:04.258
"c" shares borders with "d" and "h"

00:01:04.258 --> 00:01:08.012
"h" shares borders with "g" and "e"

00:01:08.012 --> 00:01:12.575
and "d". "gcde"

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:18.594
"d" and "e" share a border

00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:20.357
Did I get everything?

00:01:20.357 --> 00:01:24.342
"h" doesn't connect to "b". "g" doesn't connect to "c" - yes it does.

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:28.042
"g" has borders with "f", "b", "c", and "h."

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.825
Given that transformation, the equivalent graph coloring problem is going to be

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:35.309
given a graph G and some number k, can we assign

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:43.159
each of the nodes of the graph, a color, specifically some number between 1-K so that

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.958
neighbors in the graph have different numbers assigned

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.175
to them. turns out this problem comes up a lot - not just in geography.

00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:58.426
but also in computer science applications.

00:01:58.426 --> 00:02:00.260
for example, in compilers, trying to figure out how to use the registers

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.942
of the computer to evaluate expressions

00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:06.775
and it also comes up in social network problems. you can imagine saying

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:16.892
"ok i've got a group of people, here is their friend network, and what I'd like to do is group them into K different groups so that within each each group there is no pairwise friends"

00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:22.976
so you can think of this as building mixer, like a party where you want to invite your friends but you want

00:02:22.976 --> 09:59:59.000
them to interact with people they aren't already friends with
