00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.750
The problem that the composite pattern addresses is how to

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.670
organize information about whole parts relationships. That is,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.510
situations where you have to keep track of data about things and their parts.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.820
This is a common problem in software development. Think, for example,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.660
about user interfaces which are built from widgets such as windows, menus and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
forms. That are made by, made up of other widgets, text boxes, dialogues,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.290
color choosers, and so on. Other examples of composites include web pages made

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.900
up of frames, pictures, texts, and links. Documents made up of chapters, tables,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.090
diagrams, and paragraphs. And UML diagrams made up of boxes and lines.
