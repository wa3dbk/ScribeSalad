00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:02.360
Among the requirement that we can collect from the application

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.030
domain, we need to distinguish between two main types. And you've

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.540
probably heard about these ones.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.650
Functional requirments and non-functional requiremnts. Functional

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.020
requiremetns have to do with the functionality of the system, with

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.660
what the system does with the computation. For example the elevator

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.660
shall take people to the floor they select. That's a functional

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.650
requirement, that has to do with the functionality of the system.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.550
Or for a very simple one, the system has to output

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.620
the square root of the number past as

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.910
an input. So these kind of requirements have in

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.630
general well defined satisfaction criteria. So, for example, if

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.420
for the latter one that we mentioned it is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.560
pretty clear how to check whether the output

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.784
is actually the square root of the number passed

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:43.535
in input. Non-functional requirements, conversely, refer to a system's

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.800
non-functional properties, systems qualities.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.120
Such as security, accuracy, performance,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.220
cost. Or, you know, usability,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.910
adaptability, interoperability, reusability and so

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.850
on. So, all these qualities the don't necessarily have to

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.520
do with the functionality. And, unlike functional requirements, non functional

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.060
requirements Do not always have clear satisfaction criteria. For example,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.670
if we say that the elevator must be fast, that's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.640
a non-functional requrement. Right? It has to do with the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.030
speed of the elevator, which is a quality of the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.535
elevator. But, it, it's not clear how such a requirement

00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:17.980
could be satisfied. How could we tell whether the elevator

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.000
is fast or not. So, what we need to do

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.390
in these cases Is that we need to refine these

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.300
requirements so that they become verifiable. For the example that

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.360
I just mentioned, for instance, we might say that the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.730
elevator must reach the requested floor in less than 30

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.190
seconds from the moment when the floor button is pushed.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.030
This is still a non-functional requirment, but is a verifiable one.
