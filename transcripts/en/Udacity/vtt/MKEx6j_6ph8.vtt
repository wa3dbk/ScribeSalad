00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.050
Here x equals negative 3. Excellent work if you found this number. This one was

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.818
tough. Now, the first thing to notice is that 125 is 5 raised to some exponent

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:17.670
and 8 is 2 raised to some exponent. So let's rewrite this numbers with bases of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:26.760
5 for 125 and a base of 2 for 8. So, 125 is 5 cubed and 8 is 2 cubed. Now, I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.635
can pull out this third power to have 5 halves raised to the third. The

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:35.582
left-hand side of the equation just stays the same. And notice we're so close

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:40.380
for these bases to be equal. We have 2 5ths on the left, but 5 halves on the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.852
right. So, let's flip this base over. Let's do the reciprocal of it. Remember

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:51.513
that to flip over a base, or to make 5 halves become 2 5ths, we raise it to a

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:59.951
power of negative one. So, this exponent of 3 becomes negative 3. Now we have

00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:05.838
identical bases of two-fifths, so x must equal negative three. The key idea to

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:10.116
solving this problem is to remember to flip over or take the reciprocal of a

00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:14.541
base. To do that, we need a negative exponent.
