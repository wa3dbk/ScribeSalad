Once you spend enough time designing algorithms to solve specific problems you start to realize that some problems don't seem to allow for efficient solutions. Unit Six covers the concept of NP-Completeness. It doesn't actually give us a way to solve these problems any faster, but it does give us a pretty good indication when it might be okay to stop looking for an exact answer.
