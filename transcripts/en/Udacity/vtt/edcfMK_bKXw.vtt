00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is it's the more peaked Gaussian.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
That is somewhat counter-intuitive.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You'd think if this was your initial measurement probability

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you really don't know where you are, and you should pick a very wide Gaussian.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But the truth is our new sigma-squared is obtained independent of the means.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's this formula over here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now because both means are the same, this resolves to 1 over 2/σ².

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's the same as σ² over 2,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which means a new variance squared is half of the old one.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That makes it a narrower Gaussian,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so the green one here that's the most peaked is indeed the correct answer.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is very counter-intuitive, but now we understand why.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I hope you feel comfortable with the fact that we have actually gotten

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.144
more information about the location, which is manifest by a more focused estimate.
