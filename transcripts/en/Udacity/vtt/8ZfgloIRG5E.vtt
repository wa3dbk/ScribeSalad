The Central Nervous System is responsible for our brain and spinal cord. The

00:00:03.776 --> 00:00:07.208
Peripheral Nervous System is responsible for our cells outside of the Central

00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:11.516
Nervous System. And the Peripheral Nervous System is divided into the Somatic

00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:16.160
Nervous System, which is responsible for processing our sensory information.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.808
And the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for our involuntary

00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:23.780
systems. And this is divided into the sympathetic nervous system, which is

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.044
responsible for our fight or flight response. And the Parasympathetic Nervous

00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:31.899
System, which helps bring us back to normal.
