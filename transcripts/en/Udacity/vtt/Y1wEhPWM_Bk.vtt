00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's how this works in the blind signatures protocol.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Alice will generate not one message now but a hundred messages.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Each one of this form but with a different value for r1.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Alice will also pick a hundred k values. Send all of those to the bank.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The bank picks some random value x between 1 and 100 and unblinds all the other messages

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so that means that the bank will send x to Alice.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Alice needs to send something back to the bank that the bank can use to verify

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that all these messages, other than message x, contain something like this.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, what should Alice send back to the bank?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Te set of all the ri values except for the one corresponding to message x.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The set of all the ki values except for the one not matching x.

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Both of these or none of these work?
