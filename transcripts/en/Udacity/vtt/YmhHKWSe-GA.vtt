00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.150
Now let's talk about the mechanisms that are there in Exokernel for

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.260
implementing these secure bindings. There are three methods. The first method

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.340
is Hardware mechanisms. And I gave you this example of a TLB entry. Other

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.920
examples of hardware mechanisms include. Getting a physical page frame from

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.450
exokernel or a portion of the frame buffer that is

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.730
being used by the display. These are all examples of specific hardware resources

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.100
that can be requested by the library operating system and can be bound to that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.490
library operating system by exokernel. And exported

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.610
to the library operating system as an

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.830
encrypted key, and once the library operating

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.790
system has the encrypted key for that resource,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.950
it can use that any time it wants. The second mechanism that exokernel

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.150
has is software caching on behalf of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.690
each library operating system, specifically the shadow

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.620
TLB. Or caching the hardware TLB in a software cache for each library operating

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.820
system is to avoid the context switch penalty when exokernel switches from one

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.490
library operating system to another. Basically, what

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.690
will happen is that at the point

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.350
of context switch, exokernel will dump the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.720
hardware TLB into a software TLB native

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.860
structure that is associated with that specific

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.960
library operating system. And similarly load the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.070
software TLB of the library operating system to which it is switching to into

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.995
the hardware TLB. We will talk about

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:46.100
these mechanism in much more detail shortly but

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.780
at this point I wanted to mention that this is second mechanism that exists in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.320
exokernel for establishing a secure binding between

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.280
a library operating system and the hardware. The

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.460
third mechanism that exokernel has for establishing a

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.650
secure binding on behalf of an operating system

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.700
is downloading code into the kernel. This is simply to avoid border crossing by

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.310
inserting specific code. That an operating system

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.180
once executed on behalf of it. I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.900
gave you the example of the packet filter earlier. So that's an example of

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.890
downloading according to the kernel that needs

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.460
to be executed on behalf of a particular

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.080
guest operating system. And if you think about it, this idea of downloading code

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.290
into the kernel is very similar to the spin idea of extending

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.740
the kernel with logical protection domains

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.980
that I created and dynamically linked in.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.250
Similarly, in the exokernel world, a library

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.600
operating system can, if allowed by exokernel.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.500
Securely download code into the kernel that will get executed under

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.290
specific conditions that are laid down by the library operating system.
