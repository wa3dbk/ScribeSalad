00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.830
In order to complete this challenge,
I will take advantage of the for

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.420
loop I've already created.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.320
Within it, I will add an anchor tag to
edit and delete each restaurant like so.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.580
I will leave the hrefs empty
with hashtags for now,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.125
since I'll be adding the edit and delete
functionality in later objectives.

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:18.585
I rerun my server again, and
get a restaurants page with Edit and

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.555
Delete options for each restaurant.

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.485
Objective two is in the bag.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:25.675
The source code for objective two is
available in the instructor notes.
