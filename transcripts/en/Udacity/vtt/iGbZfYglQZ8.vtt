00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.737
So let's have a quiz. Are the following code snippets correct?

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.250
Here's some function, some kernel,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.341
and it's going to declare an array of ints and shared memory--1,024 ints,

00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:15.318
and then for convenience we'll define i to be equal to thread index,

00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:17.427
and then we've got a bunch of functions.

00:00:17.427 --> 00:00:20.162
And I want you to check the ones that are going to

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:22.461
run correctly without additional sync threads.

00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:26.736
And let's go ahead and put a sync thread before and after each of these code snippets,

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:30.368
because it's really the lines here themselves

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:32.134
that I'm asking you about,

00:00:32.134 --> 00:00:35.526
and we can assume there is a sync thread ahead of this and a sync thread after.
