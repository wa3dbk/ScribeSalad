00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All of that was just introducing these two functions, and so the deal is,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is this really easy to write straightforward code for this?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's take a quick look. So, here's high<u>common</u>bits.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
All we're going to do is walk through the bits in the input here. I'm assuming a 64-bit input.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We're going to walk through the input, reversed, so from 63 to 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And every time we see 2 bits being the same in a and b, we copy that bits to the output.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
As soon as we see 2 bits at the same position that are different in a and b,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we set that bit position in the output and return it, and low<u>common</u>bits are just the same.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The only thing that is different is we looped from 0 to 63 instead of 63 to 0,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but we do exactly the same thing we're copying bits in the output

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
as long as they are common between a and b.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And as soon as we see a difference, setting the bit and return it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What we have here is a really slow implementation.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Even if we translate this implementation straightforwardly to see,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
it's still going to be really slow compared to optimized implementation.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Optimized implementations of this are going to be potentially more complicated

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and potentially harder to get it right, but it might execute in just a handful of clock cycles

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
as opposed to maybe a hundred clock cycles for the optimized C versions

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and probably thousands of clock cycles for the Python.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Of course, performances are really going to be our concern here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We're just using this to illustrate initially that comes up and extremely optimize chart codes.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The factor we're trying so hard to optimize these codes means

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we're going to have some concerns about whether they are correct or not.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Let's talk about how we're going to deal with that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
What we're probably going to do is write a random tester.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The reason we're going to write a random tester is with 64-bit inputs,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the input demand for either of these functions is going to contain

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
220 elements so it's far too big, too exhaustible test.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We're going to be forced to do some sort of either systematic testing or random testing.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There's is no way out of partial testing of these functions.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The most obvious kind of random tester array

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
would be make a random 64-bit integer, make another one.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now assert that our super super optimized high<u>common</u>bits function called with a and b

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
returned the same results as a reference implementation

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that showed through Python version but sort of simple incredibly obvious code

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and maybe reference implementation at C, it doesn't really matter.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We're just going to randomly test all sorts of configuration of the function.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The question we're going to ask is, is this a good random tester?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And what we might do is run the code coverage tool so let's go ahead and do that.
