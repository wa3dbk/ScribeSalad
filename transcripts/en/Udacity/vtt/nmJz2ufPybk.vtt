00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's look at the solution to our
virtual to physical Translation

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.800
speed Quiz.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.220
We were asked,
how many cycles do we need for

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.630
our load instruction if we
use 3-level page table?

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.160
We need 1 cycle to compute
the virtual address.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.958
We need 10 cycles to access
the outermost page table.

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:20.430
10 cycles to access the next
level of page table,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.340
10 cycles to access
the inner-most page table.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.170
Because neither of those can be cached.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.800
Plus, we need to do the actual
cache access and maybe the memory.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.780
So, overall,
we need 1 + 3 levels of page tables,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.080
times memory latency, plus one
cycle to have a hit in our cache,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.790
plus, 10% of the time, we have.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.370
A miss penalty to access the memory.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.530
This ends up being 33 cycles, 30 of
which are to access the page tables.
