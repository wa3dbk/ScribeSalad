00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.219
This ellipse would be centered at 2, negative 1. Nice work if you got the

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:11.567
center. The a value was 3, and the b value was 6. Even better if you got all

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:15.911
three correct. We know that the center is at 2, negative 1, since this is a

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:21.336
minus 2 and this is a positive 1. Since we subtract two from x, we really move

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:26.564
two units to the right from the origin. Then we move one unit down since

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:30.890
there's a plus 1 with the y term. Remember we move in the opposite direction of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.453
what we think. So, now that we know the center is here, we can use the values

00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:40.190
of a and b to get four other points. To get the value of a, we take the square

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.265
root of 9, which equals 3. And to get the value of b, we take the square root

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:49.910
of 36 which equals 6. We know that we need to move left 3 units and right 3

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.311
units from the center to get two other points on our ellipse. We can also move

00:00:55.311 --> 00:01:01.385
six units up and six units down, to get two more points on the ellipse. Now if

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:04.209
you haven't quite got it, that's okay, try this next one.
