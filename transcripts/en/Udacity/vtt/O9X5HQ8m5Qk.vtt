00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.670
This wasn't too bad.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.120
I simply started with a jQuery object and passed it the string of .article-item.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.860
Let's go ahead and console.log it to see if it worked.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.610
I'll hit Test Run, okay.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.970
The page appeared down here.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.010
I'll open up the console, and there we go.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.440
We can see a list of article items.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.750
Very cool.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.690
Once again, there are some errors being shown here, and you might see some too.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.570
But don't worry, just focus on what the console's producing for your code.
