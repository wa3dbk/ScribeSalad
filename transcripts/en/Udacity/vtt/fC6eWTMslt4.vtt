00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.100
Since every Linux machine comes
with the user name root and

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.120
that user is super powerful, they can
do anything they want on this machine.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.870
It's very common to disable the ability
to remotely log in as root.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.680
Instead, we'll log in as
a user we create, and

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.130
then we can run individual commands
as root by using another command.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.910
This is to make any potential
attacker's job a little more difficult

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.120
by eliminating the username that they
already know exists on this on this box.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.250
Our vagrant virtual machine has already
set up the security pattern for us and

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.190
many other cloud providers
will do this for you, as well.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.240
If not, it's highly advised that this be
one of the very first things you do when

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.990
you're setting up a new server.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.680
We'll cover exactly how
to do that a bit later.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.070
&gt;&gt; Let's run that same command again,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.920
except this time we'll prepend the
command with this pseudo command here.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.050
Now we see the results.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.380
The pseudo command ran this
command as if we were root.
