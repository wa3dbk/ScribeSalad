00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.660
For this equation x equals positive 3. Nice work if you found 3. We'll start by

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.540
changing this equation into exponential form. We'll have a base of 3, an

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.609
exponent of x set equal to positive 27. Next we'll rewrite 27 as 3 cubed, so

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.335
that way our two bases will match. This must mean that x has to equal positive

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:26.463
3.
