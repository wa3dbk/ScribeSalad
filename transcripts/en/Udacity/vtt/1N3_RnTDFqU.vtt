[Narrator] Well, histogram filters tend to be approximate

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because the world tends not to be discrete.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So localization, for example, it's clearly an approximate filter.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It turns out kalman filters are also approximate,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and it's a much more subtle observation.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It turns out kalman filters only are exact for linear systems,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
whereas the world happens to be nonlinear.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now this goes into a lot of deep math, which I don't want to get into here,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but you should understand that both of these filters are not exact.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Both of them tend to be just approximations of the correct posterior distribution.
