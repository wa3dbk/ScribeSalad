00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.377
Here are three more sets of equations. We know these equations really represent

00:00:04.377 --> 00:00:08.771
lines, so tell me, is each pair perpendicular, parallel, or neither? Put the

00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:12.911
letter of the correct choice here, and as a hint, notice that all of these

00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:17.616
equations are in standard form. We can find the slope in the standard form using

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.985
negative A over B. So what do you think for each of these?
