00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.750
At Udacity we just released a new feature.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.500
Text.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.440
Tada! You'll be able to start seeing reading more so

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.320
it'll show up inside your courses.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.710
But don't worry, we aren't going to make you read a novel or

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.720
a textbook but sometimes it's useful to leave text for you.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.440
Like you might see GitHub instructions or

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.538
a project rubric inside a reading morsel.

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:20.920
But the Udacity classroom isn't too large.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.150
We only have this much space to work with.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.910
So, instead of forcing everything to move down,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.720
we use an overflow to make sure that text can scroll.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.010
You've probably seen something like this on other web sites.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.980
Let's see what this looks like in CSS.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.210
I will right click here, go to inspect elements,.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.716
Inside Div Tools, we can see that the text on the screen has this CSS class for

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:43.670
overflow:auto within the reading-area class.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.430
If we uncheck it, let's see what happens.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.680
I'll click it and make Dev Tools disappear.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.720
We can see that the text is flowing outside of the classroom and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.120
into the elements below it.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.200
And this is obviously a problem.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.100
Let me go ahead and

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.190
turn Overflow Auto back on, and everything is safely back in here.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.860
It's worth keeping overflow in mind in the event that you've got a lot of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.700
text you want to contain in a small area
