Ã¯Â»Â¿Student Sanjayman asks what are the major problems search engines are trying to solve today.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.183
So I hope weÃ¢Â€Â™ll see some creative solutions of new things that you can do

00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:12.624
with search engines as part of the contest

00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:15.562
and we will be releasing the full details on that soon.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:17.947
The kinds of things that are probably the biggest things

00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:20.098
that commercial search engines are working on today,

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:22.863
one is always getting better results, right.

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:24.906
Finding better ways to find the best page,

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:27.637
finding ways to respond queries that are more complex

00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:30.138
and have more than just one keyword, doing things

00:00:30.138 --> 00:00:32.856
that will get people what they are searching for.

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:35.987
The other thing that I think is probably a big effort

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:39.496
and is an increasing arms race is dealing with efforts

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:43.129
to get pages ranked highly that arenÃ¢Â€Â™t active,

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.974
so people are trying to do things, they call it link spam sometimes

00:00:45.974 --> 00:00:49.306
trying to make pages that will rank highly but donÃ¢Â€Â™t have good content

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:53.152
and this is sort of a never ending battle between the search engine companies

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.962
and the people who want to create content that ranks highly.

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:59.395
Every time Google tweaks their algorithm, lots of people get upset

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:03.476
because their PageRanks go down. That could be unfair.

00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:07.553
It could be because they have good content and that new algorithm is unfair to them.

00:01:07.553 --> 00:01:10.738
It could be because the algorithm has been tweaked to try to remove things

00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:14.788
from high ranks that donÃ¢Â€Â™t have the content that users are actually looking for.

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:18.504
So thatÃ¢Â€Â™s really a never ending battle to try to get the best results.

00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:22.042
And there is also a lot of effort to kind of instead of just

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:26.616
returning a query - returning results for a given search query but to answer questions.

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:27.363
Yeah.

00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:30.906
And so you can go into whatever search engine you use and ask like,

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:35.093
when is new year, what day is new year or the Chinese new year

00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:38.650
and itÃ¢Â€Â™ll give you the date instead of just Ã¢Â€Â“ in addition to the results

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.619
and will start answering questions and this is kind of the first step

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.097
into kind of organizing search engines around what we want to know.

00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:50.155
And in some search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:51.868
are pretty good with questions like that.

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:55.784
To actually understand natural language well enough to be able to answer

00:01:55.784 --> 00:01:58.967
a complex question that doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t fit some known structure

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:01.945
is a really hard problem but is definitely something that is

00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:05.000
in the future of search engines to do that well.
