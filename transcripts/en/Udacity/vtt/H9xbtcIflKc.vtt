00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.425
We need an exponent of 4 here and an exponent of 6 here. Remember that the

00:00:06.425 --> 00:00:10.956
interest is being compounded twice a year. So to figure out how many times it

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:16.500
has been compounded total, we multiply the number of years that have passed

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.491
times the number of times compounded in a year.
