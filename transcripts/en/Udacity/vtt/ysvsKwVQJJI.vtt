Now that we have considered storage, let's revisit retrieval. We talked about

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.470
two different ways of organizing the case memory, a tabular way and

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.800
a discrimination tree. How can we retrieve the case relevant to a given problem?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.550
We assume here that the new problem has the same features in its description as

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.940
the cases stored in the memory. Earlier when we were storing a case in memory,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.220
at that time we were navigating this tree to find where in this tree should we

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.800
store the new case. This time, we'll use the problem to navigate this tree and

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.160
find out which case is most similar to the problem.
