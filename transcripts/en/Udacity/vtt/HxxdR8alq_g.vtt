Here's my answer.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.689
This is just a souped up version of
the filtering idea that we saw before.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.430
We run the input machine
M on the empty string.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.250
If it loops, then so will N,
and it will accept nothing.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.700
So N is not in the language L.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.364
On the other hand, if M halts,
then N behaves like a machine in

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:27.480
the language returning true if
the input string matches 0 to the n,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
1 to the n and false otherwise.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.110
In the one case,
the language of N is the empty set.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.787
In the other case, it is the set
of strings of the form 0 to the n,

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:38.481
1 to the n.

00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:41.580
And, of course, a decider for
L can tell the difference.
