00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.698
Now that we know what vertex form looks like for equations of problems that have

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:09.384
leading coefficients other than 1, let's see if we can get this equation in this

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:13.970
form. We have y equals 3x squared plus 6x minus 10. Now what was that tool we

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.926
used before to get equations in vertex form? It was called completing the

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:21.322
square. So that's what we need to do here, complete the square. The process is

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:24.598
going to be slightly different, since we have this 3 present now, instead of a 1

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:27.949
in front of the x squared. But, let's give it a try. Well, the first thing we

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.415
did before, when we were starting to complete the square. Was recognize that

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:35.127
this constant over here is probably not the constant we're going to need if we

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:39.010
want a perfect square term on the right hand side of the equation. So we want to

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.301
get the constant off the right hand side and onto the left hand side. So if we

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:45.953
do that, what does our equation look like now?
