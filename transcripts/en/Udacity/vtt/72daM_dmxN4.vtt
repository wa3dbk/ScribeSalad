00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The for statement up here, indeed, controls whether this entire block is executed or not.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Therefore, it also controls whether B is executed or not.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If this condition holds, then tag is set to true.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If it does not hold, execution resumes for the remaining conditions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And therefore, this if condition also controls whether this is executed.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Same thing happens for the other condition.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The last condition, however, only controls whether the character

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
will be edited out or not.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It has no influence on whether code is being set or not.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Therefore, this statement does not influence whether B is executed or not.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
B is not control dependent on it.
