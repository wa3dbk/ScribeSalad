00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.512
Now we can even think about adding together these two use cases.

00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:09.549
The notation we'll use is to say that messages labeled with

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.614
the letter A correspond to use case number one and

00:00:12.614 --> 00:00:16.901
messages labeled with the letter B are a part of use case number two.

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.993
And the steps are still numbered one, two, three, and so on.

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:24.121
And so we see that we have now a diagram in which both of

00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:26.452
the use cases are listed there.

00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:29.992
And it could also have been the case that the second use case might have,

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:33.550
might have used a different class that wasn't used in the first case.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.390
In which case, adding it in means that we now have you know,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.180
four classes in our, in our diagram.
