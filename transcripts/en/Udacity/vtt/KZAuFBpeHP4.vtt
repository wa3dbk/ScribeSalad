00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.830
There are various options of indexing.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.610
And that gives NumPy
indexing great power.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.690
NumPy array can be indexed
with other arrays.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.810
It is just one other tool
which can be used to make

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.130
process of accessing
values in array easy.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.140
To start with, we create a one
dimensional array of five random values.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.470
Next we create a variable indices
which is also a one dimensional array.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.490
But the elements of this array,
which is 1, 1, 2, 3,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.509
are actually the index
we need to access.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.420
That is, we want the value at index 1,
again at 1, 2, followed by 3.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.560
Next step we learn how to use
this indices along with the edit

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.860
to access the desired values.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.740
Yes, you saw that right.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.150
Just passing the area of indices to
another area will give us the values.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.190
Let's check the output.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.220
So here is the output.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.590
Observe that the length
of the indices array and

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.150
the returned array is the same.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.701
Also it return value from
array a at index 1,1,2,3.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.503
It is a bit difficult to understand
the application of this now, but

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:16.330
this is a tool you would like
to use once you get hold of it.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.060
We can do such indexing using
multidimensional array as well.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.090
But things get complicated with
creating multi-dimensional index array.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.020
These are just a few
interesting ways of indexing.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.670
There are a lot more out there for
you to experiment with.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.390
