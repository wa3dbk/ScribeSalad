00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:06.181
And, the answer is, again, 0.002777 and so on,

00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:09.617
which is the same as 1 over 360. And, the way

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:12.172
to see this is that the width of this interval over

00:00:12.172 --> 00:00:14.875
here is 360. We didn’t know the height which

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:18.388
is what I asked you to guess. But, if we multiply

00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:23.036
360 by 1 over 360 then the area of this rectangle

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:27.000
over here becomes 1. So, let’s do this again.
