Good job if you got that. Here is my implementation.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We just iterate over the list of links for l in links,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and if ID = 15, I return the number of votes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Not too complicated.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, what if I were to ask something a little bit more complicated?
