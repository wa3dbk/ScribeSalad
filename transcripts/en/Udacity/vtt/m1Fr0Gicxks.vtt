00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.351
So we're going to go about this the same way that we did on the other sort.

00:00:02.351 --> 00:00:06.293
Every time we see a pair of lines that are connected by a green line,

00:00:06.293 --> 00:00:09.115
we will compare the 2 elements and put the smaller one at the top

00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:10.754
and the larger one at the bottom.

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:13.326
So we'll compare 4 and 2 and switch their order.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:16.429
We'll compare 1 and 3, and they're already in the right order.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.809
Now we're comparing 2 and 1. So 2 will go here and 1 will go here.

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:24.377
Now we'll compare 4 and 3 and we say they're in the wrong order as well,

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:27.705
and note that 2 and 3 have one more comparison to go.

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:30.497
But note that we come out again with a sorted sequence.
