00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.452
And the answer is log2 (n).

00:00:02.452 --> 00:00:06.309
Note that 2^ the number of steps equals the number of elements.

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:10.730
We would say that the step complexity of this parallel algorithm is O(log n).

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.566
So if we reduced 1024 elements, we would see that it would take 10 steps,

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.741
compared to 1023 in the serial case.

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:21.034
This is 2 orders of magnitude fewer steps.

00:00:21.034 --> 00:00:25.268
And now you're starting to get an idea of why parallel implementation might get significant speedups.

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:29.449
However, note that it can only get these speedups if it has enough processors

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.345
to handle all these operations at the same time.

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:37.013
If we're adding 1024 elements in parallel, our 1st step requires performing

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:39.716
512 additions at the same time.

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:41.718
Now, a modern GPU can actually handle this.

00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:46.426
But if we're adding a million items in parallel, our math would tell us we could finish in 20 steps

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:51.517
but would also tell us we'd need to perform 500,000 additions at the 1st step at the 1st time,

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:55.266
which is not too likely given the desktop hardware we have at our disposal today.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.869
That's okay, though.

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.612
Even if we're only keeping 500 processors doing additions throughout the computation

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:03.435
rather than 500,000, that's still an enormous speedup

00:01:03.435 --> 00:01:06.548
over having only 1 processor doing additions.

00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:09.587
It's a good exercise to work out how many steps it takes to run this algorithm

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:13.318
for an input of size n if you have only p processors.

00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:17.289
This is called Brent's Theorem, which the interested student will want to look up

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.457
and perhaps discuss on the discussion forum.
