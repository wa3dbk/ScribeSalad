00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.756
So going back to our mani-core challenges, we have

00:00:02.756 --> 00:00:05.588
looked at how to handle the increase in coherence traffic

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:08.730
on-chip. We looked at how to deal with the increase

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.107
in the off-chip traffic. We looked at how to have

00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:15.786
a directory on-chip that is not too large. We looked

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:18.142
at how to solve the problem of the splitting of

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:21.304
the power budget among cores even when they're running very

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:25.222
few threads. And finally we looked at the problem of,

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:29.434
what to do in an operating system when there are multi-threaded

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:33.450
cores and maybe multiple chips like that in the same system.
