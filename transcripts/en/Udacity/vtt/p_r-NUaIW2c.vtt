00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.290
Here we have a gruesome problem. Although the title

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.890
is a bit menacing, all we're really going to do is

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.970
color words. Sounds like fun. So, we're going to use two

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.390
colors to start out with, blue and green. Now, we

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.340
say a word is blue if a lower case

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.810
b occurs before a lower case t within the word.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.100
We say a word is green if a lower case

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.650
g occurs after the occurrence of a lower case t.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.915
Within the word. So an example of a blue

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:30.751
word would be wombat, because we have a lowercase

00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:33.863
b, occurring before lowercase t. As an example of

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:37.994
a green word, we have racketeering, because g occurs after

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:41.290
the current lowercase t. As one last example, we

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.850
have the word abating, which is blue, because b occurs

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.850
before t. And green because g occurs after t.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.570
So, yes, one word can be both blue and green.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.190
And, lastly, we just find a new color. I will

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.050
call is grue. It may look like some purplish-pink. But,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.740
it's a brand new color that you've never seen before

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.730
because I say so. I word is grue if it's

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.580
blue or green. And it can be both blue and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.871
green and still be grue. So all three of the

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.400
words I used here are grue. So those are our

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.710
gruesome words and we've been asked to identify all the grue

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
words within a given string. And we're going to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.510
use our regular expressions skills to do that. So what

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.070
is a regular expression going to look like? My basic

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.500
strategy is going to write it like this. Where I'm

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.970
going to define what a blue word is like

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.470
and a green word is like and match both words

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.340
using the regular expression or operator. So first let's look

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.200
at blue. Here I have the regex for blue words.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.650
We have zero more characters followed by a lower case b.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.740
And in between the B and the T can be zero

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.640
more characters, and after the B and the T can be

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.740
zero more characters. We're going to do the same thing with green. Here

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.670
I have a T and a G with zero more characters

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.570
before and after and in between. So, here I have a solution

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.900
to the problem. I import the regular expression library, and then

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.930
I just use re dot find all, with the completed regular expression.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.320
First we identify. Blue words and then afterwards we do the green words

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.790
and we just feed in the string that we passed into the function.
