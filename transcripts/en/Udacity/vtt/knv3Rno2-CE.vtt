00:00:00.057 --> 00:00:02.632
Our focus is instead to compute the histogram itself.

00:00:02.632 --> 00:00:05.079
Look forward in this week's assignment.

00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:08.337
You'll compute the histogram of pixel intensity values in an image.

00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:11.437
Histograms are not a difficult problem if you think about them serially,

00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:13.413
but they get more interesting and parallel.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:18.919
So let's first take a look at the serial histogram algorithm. Here's our code here.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.580
We're going to have 2 for loops where we loop over all the histogram bins.

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:28.926
So in the first phase, we initialize all the Bins to 0, the counts for each of the bins to zero.

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:33.697
This is so simple, we're not going to mention it again. Much more interesting is the second phase.

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:36.522
We're going to loop through all the data measurements.

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:40.916
For each data measurement, we first determine to which bin it belongs.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:44.313
That's the compute bin call. And I'll show an example in a second.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.727
Then we fetch the current value of that bin,

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:50.126
increment it, and store the new value back into the bin.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:56.211
For instance, in the previous example, let's say the input to compute bin is 175 centimeters.

00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:59.343
So we take a measurement. It's 175 centimeters.

00:00:59.343 --> 00:01:06.077
Compute bin then decides which of these bins is associated with 175 centimeters.

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:08.663
In this case, compute bin would return this bin

00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:11.842
because it stores all of the measurements between 165 and 180.

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:17.997
So, we take 175. It's then associated with this bin, and now we increment the value of this bin.

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:21.467
So now let's consider these 4 bins, and we're going to trace

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:26.690
a program with the 4 measurements 155, 150, 175, and 170 centimeters.

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:32.954
So the first loop here will initialize each of these bins to 0 items, and then we'll

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:37.627
walk through these 4 measurements using compute bin to decide which bin they're in

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:39.997
and incrementing the values in those bins.

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.711
So, first we'll consider 155.

00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:46.849
Compute bin will tell us it's in this bin right here, so I'll increment its value to 1.

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:52.067
Then we look at 150. Compute bin will tell us its value is in this bin again,

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:54.120
and we'll increment its value to 2.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.758
Next we'll consider 175, which is associated with this bin.

00:01:57.758 --> 00:01:59.565
And now we've incremented its value.

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:01.982
And finally 170 will allow us to store 2.

00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:05.319
So a couple of quick questions to make sure you understand the histogram.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:08.455
Let's say we have n measurements and b bins.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.425
As a function of n and b, what is the maximum number of

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:14.179
measurements we would possibly ever see per bin,

00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:17.698
and what is the average number of measurement you would see per bin?
