00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.880
So, how do you go about
choosing a library?

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.970
There's a few things to look at.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.990
Central to everything is functionality.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.320
So, the first step is to figure out
what the library actually gives you.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.600
If the source code is available, that
would be the ultimate source of truth,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.450
but it's probably not
the best place to start.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.570
Instead, consider looking for an
overview Readme or a Quick Start Guide.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.060
These should help you get
the essence of the library and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.830
highlight the common use cases.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.980
The library really makes easy,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.720
ideally, these should match
exactly what you need to do.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.900
This is also where Integration and
Instructions should be found.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.810
Finding easy to understand
gradal instructions,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.158
can make a huge difference
in getting up and running.

00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:49.090
Lack of gradal instructions might
mean extra pain and maintenance time.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.880
For UI libraries,
you might also look for screen shots,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.100
videos, a demo app or
real world apps that use the library.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
All can be powerful signals
in determining if this is

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.030
actually what you need.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.290
There are specific things you
need that aren't readily visible,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.160
may be time to look
through the documentation.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.180
Good documentation is a sign that
the library developers care a lot

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.890
about the developer
usability of their library.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.300
Two other factors you might
consider are recent activity and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.100
whether there is a community
around the library.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.390
Both are good signs that if
you come across an issue, or

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.990
a bug, you won't be on your own.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.510
While none of these things except the
core functionality are deal breakers,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.812
there is a strong correlation
between these factors and

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:38.680
well designed and useful libraries.
