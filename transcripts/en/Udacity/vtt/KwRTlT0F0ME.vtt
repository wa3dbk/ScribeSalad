00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.480
With the basic app you've just built,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.090
you can configure the initial state
of the map in a number of ways.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.850
For documentation on all of the ways you
can configure it, using XML attributes,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.690
look in the instructor notes below.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.480
But for now we'll configure
a few attributes to show

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.210
something interesting.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.280
So here's the layout that you had
just created with your fragment

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.990
containing the maps fragment.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.474
And this gave you the default Google
maps that you've been using throughout.

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:26.750
But what we're going to do is
we're going to change this.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.610
So we're going to take a look at
New York City with a flyover type view.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.514
So first of all, there's going to be
a number of attributes on the fragment

00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:34.858
that we're going to need to set.

00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:37.790
And we're going to do these
using the Maps namespace.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.830
So we need to tell the XML
about the Maps namespace first.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.490
So I'm going to do that up here.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.640
And you see,
we have XML namespace tool equals this.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.937
We're going to create a new
XML namespace for our map.

00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:52.593
And here are the details for
the XML namespace for map.

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:55.380
As you can see, xmlns:map is equal to

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.834
http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-au-
to/.

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:04.160
So this will give us the map attributes
that we can now add to our fragment.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.870
Map attributes will consist of
things such as the latitude and

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.870
the longitude of what
you want to look at.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.947
So the latitude and

00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:13.728
longitude of the area in New York City
we're going to look at a la now.

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:17.328
Here you can see, I've added
the map camera target latitude and

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:19.068
map camera target longitude.

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:22.010
Don't worry about the red
underlines on them at the moment.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.510
Now, when you're looking at a map,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.540
you actually look at a map
through a virtual camera.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.040
So you tell the camera
the target latitude and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.950
longitude that it's going to look at.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.618
So the latitude of downtown
New York City is 40.7484 and

00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:38.972
the longitude is negative 73.9857.

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:42.445
But what this is going to do is, if you
remember when you first run the map,

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:45.730
you had a view from high in
orbit looking down on the Earth.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.400
And this will do that, but it will
be looking down on New York City.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.430
But all it's going to
do is shift the camera.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.040
&gt;From being high in orbit looking down on

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.280
the equator to being high in orbit
looking down on New York City.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.661
So we also want to move the camera so
we zoom down onto New York City.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.180
And we'll change a couple of things.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.810
I'm going to add them and
then talk through them one by one.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.140
So these are the three
attributes that I've added.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.292
The first is the Camera-Bearing.

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:11.720
The Camera-Bearing is the direction
that the camera is looking at,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.633
with zero degrees being looking north,
180 degrees being looking south.

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.862
So as a result, you can see I'm
looking at 112.5 degrees, so

00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:22.118
I'm kind of looking east
with my camera bearing.

00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:25.730
Next is going to be the camera tilt, so
if you can imagine the camera when it's

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.910
looking straight down,
it's going to be tilted at 90 degrees.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.670
But if I can change that to 65 degrees,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.910
then the camera is going to be appearing
somewhat at an angle looking down, so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.800
we have a nice 3-D isometric
view of the world beneath us.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.470
And then finally is the Camera ZOOM.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.050
The larger the number, the closer
you are to the surface of the Earth.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.790
So if you can imagine a Camera ZOOM 0,
that's what we've had all along,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.390
where the camera is way up.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.790
Looking down on the Earth.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.260
But with a Camera ZOOM 17, I'm going
down really close to the Earth.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.918
And as you'll see, because I've
got a camera tilt of 65 degrees,

00:02:56.918 --> 00:03:00.083
I'm getting a 3D view of
the skyscrapers in New York City.

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:01.678
And with the Camera ZOOM being 17,

00:03:01.678 --> 00:03:04.940
I'm actually lower than the level
of some of these skyscrapers.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.550
So, let's run the application and
see what it looks like.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.380
So, now here we see the application
running on my tablet.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.120
It gives us a view of downtown New York,
and I can actually scroll around and

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.160
see the city in three dimensions.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.450
So I can see some of the skyscrapers
that are cylindrical in shape.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.472
And as we had an earlier on,

00:03:20.472 --> 00:03:23.450
we were actually looking the base of the
Empire State Building, and here you can

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.270
see the Empire State Building rising
out of the view of the camera.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.140
Because the camera is actually lower
than the height of the building.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.759
And as I zoom around New York City and
I pan around, we can take a look at some

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.150
of the interesting features
in some of the buildings.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.130
For example, here is the United Nations
headquarters, overlooking the river.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.060
Here are things like some of
the islands in the river itself, and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.970
we can see the skyscrapers on them.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.000
Sometimes, it takes a little while for
them to show up.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.880
So you've effectively gotten
all of this for free,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.390
you didn't need to set up anything to
get the 3D views or anything like that.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.530
Just basically by the fact
that you tilted the camera and

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.070
were close enough into the earth,
to be able to see the 3D views.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.210
If I were to zoom out you'll see,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.880
I'm just going to see now a pan-view
of New York City without the 3D.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.029
As I zoom out, you can see we
were facing towards the East,

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.713
looking out over Long Island.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:10.437
When I zoom in over the city again, once
I get close enough we'll start seeing

00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:12.744
the buildings and
the skyscrapers popping up.

00:04:12.744 --> 00:04:14.572
And there they are.

00:04:14.572 --> 00:04:15.377
Pretty simple,

00:04:15.377 --> 00:04:19.250
just all of this was done just by
setting attributes on the map fragment.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.910
Pretty cool, right?
