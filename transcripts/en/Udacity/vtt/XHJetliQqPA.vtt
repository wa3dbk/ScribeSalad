00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.543
This matrix has values in the first three positions in the last row, so it's a

00:00:03.543 --> 00:00:07.813
projection matrix of some sort. Of our choices, only the perspective matrix is

00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:12.238
a projection. Rotations affect the off-diagonal elements of the upper 3 by 3 of

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:16.322
the matrix. The view matrix is the only one of the 3 choices with rotations in

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:21.854
it. This leaves the third matrix to be the NDC to window matrix. This

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:25.016
conversion is a scale and a translate, which is certainly what this matrix

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:26.220
contains.
