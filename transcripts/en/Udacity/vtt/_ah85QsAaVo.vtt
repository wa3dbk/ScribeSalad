00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.859
Let's try a little experiment.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.340
I want you to read the first
paragraph of Alice's Adventure in

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.540
Wonderland out loud.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.460
It's a little weird right?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.170
With only a few words per line,
it's kind of awkward to read.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.690
Words or
phrases that might be read as groups,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.350
end up getting broken
across multiple lines.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.960
Making it hard to parse the sentences.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.600
Why don't you try this one instead.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.080
It's got a few more words per line, so
maybe we won't have the same problem.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.530
It's the same content but with more
words and it still doesn't work.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.470
If a line of text is too long,
readers get lost when trying to

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.680
find the next line and end up reading
the same thing over and over again.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.760
Or they get lazy and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.940
might read the first part of each line,
but by the end, they're skimming.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.030
Over the last century,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.680
there's been lots of research done
to determine the ideal measure.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.020
That's the technical term for
the length of a line.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.190
I've seen research ranging from
45 characters per line to as

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.440
many as 90 characters per line,
depending on the font used,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.430
if it's in print, if it's projected,
or on a computer screen.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.460
But, there seems to be a pretty solid
consensus around 65 characters per

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.990
line for the web.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.730
It's not a hard and fast rule,
but it's a good place to start.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.370
We need to consider the way people
read as we create our designs,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.510
since it can affect our layout.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.800
That's why line length is
an important factor to consider as

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.480
you're building sites, and
something I always take into

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.780
consideration as I
choose my breakpoints.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.740
It's also important to make sure
that fonts are big enough to

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.520
read across any device.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.140
I always set my base font
to at least 16 pixels,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.210
and at least a 1.2em line height.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.310
Depending on the situation, I may even
increase it for text heavy sites.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.590
14 pixels is just too small.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.500
That may sound big, but makes for
a much better reading experience.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.690
Even on a desktop, it works quite well.
