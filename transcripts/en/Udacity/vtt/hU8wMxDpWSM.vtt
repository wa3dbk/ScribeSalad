00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So if this is true, then it does have universal recognized value.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Everyone can check that signature and know it's an IOU from IP Bank.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It does seem to be easy to transfer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You can just send the bits to another person.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It could be anonymous and untraceable, and let's assume that it is.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This would be the case if all the IOUs the bank creates are exactly the same.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The way we describe it seems like they are.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's very light and portable, so it looks like we're doing really well.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We've got four out of five.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We've got a big problem, though. It's not hard to copy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's, in fact, trivial to copy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We can send the same bits multiple times and no one knows

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which ones are valid and which ones are copies.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So this doesn't work. Once we've lost this property, we've lost this one as well.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It is hard to forge.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
To forge it we'd need to know the private key of the bank,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but that doesn't matter, because once we have one bill

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
we can make any number of copies of it and spend them as many times as we want.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This means it actually doesn't have the universally recognized value.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Depending on how you interpret this question, this is what I think is the correct answer,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but there are other ways to interpret this where your answer could be equally valid

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and correct and not match mine.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
One way to solve this would be to give each bill a unique ID.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Then if someone attempts to double spend a bill

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the bank would check has that bill be spent already.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If it's been spent already, the bank would alert the spender that it's not a valid bill.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This would also cause problems for the second possibility.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It would no longer be easy to transfer if you have to check the ID

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
with the bank every time you get a bill.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It would also no longer be anonymous.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It would mean the bank can track all the transactions,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
because every time there's a transaction, the bank sees the unique ID

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and knows who is transferring money to whom.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Our goal is to have unique IDs to prevent this copying problem

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but preserve the anonymity and somewhat preserve the easy to transfer.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We'll still need the bank to check the ID when the money is deposited,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but maybe there could be transactions before that, and we can trace them back

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to who cheated at a point where the cheating happened. That's our goal.

00:02:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The main tool that we need for this is a new cryptographic technique called blind signatures.
