00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.547
Our even functions (those which are symmetric across the y axis) are A, B, and F.

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:10.209
This one, this one, and this one.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.735
We have two odd functions in the graph:
graph C and graph D.

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:20.461
And we have one function that is neither even nor odd,
which is this graph E.
