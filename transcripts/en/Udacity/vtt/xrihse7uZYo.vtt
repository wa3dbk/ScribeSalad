00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.138
Let's Click and Drag, to see what the population is predicted to be by the blue

00:00:03.138 --> 00:00:12.955
curve. So I want an x coordinate of 2013, and there it is, 2013. And it says

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:19.945
that the population should be 7.695 billion. So I'm going to round that number

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:24.601
up, just for simplicity, to 7.7 billion. And is this a better prediction than

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:29.739
the last one? I would say yes, definitely. We know the population 2013 is

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.979
probably greater than that of 2011, which was already 7 billion people. 7.7

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:41.930
billion is much closer to 7 billion than 3.2, our earlier prediction was.
