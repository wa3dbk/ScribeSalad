00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:06.114
Congratulations, while it
may not seem like much,

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:08.480
you've gotten quite far already.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.610
You learned how to connect user
interface element to the code

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.890
with IB actions, and use IB outlets
to change the state of UI elements

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.400
from the code within
your view controller.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.770
You've also taken your first steps
into auto layout and, of course,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.450
in developing for iOS using Swift.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.700
Let's take a moment and discuss where
these UILabels and UIButtons come from.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.330
In developing for iOS,
Apple wanted to make it easier for

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.330
us to create interactive elements.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.660
To that end, much as it is on the Mac,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.050
they've developed a series of frameworks
that we can use in building our iOS app.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.160
The main framework you're going to
be using in this iOS development is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.630
called UIkit.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.190
Any classes that start with UI
are from the UIkit framework.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.730
And these include UILabel, UIButton,
UIView, and even UIViewController.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.971
We've not talked about
UIViewController as much yet, but

00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:59.170
we're going to go into much
more detail in the next lesson.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.821
There we'll provide
the logic behind a view and

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:04.747
what connects it to the model
which has all the data.

00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:06.244
Sound familiar?

00:01:06.244 --> 00:01:10.806
Yep, it's the model view controller
pattern we discussed earlier.

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:14.131
There are many many classes
inside the UIkit framework,

00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:18.270
ranging from labels to buttons,
all the way to table views.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.070
In addition to UIKit, there are many
other powerful frameworks in iOS,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.230
from audio, to rendering,
to web services,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.612
to even gathering data from the GPS,
gyroscope and accelerometer.

00:01:29.612 --> 00:01:31.650
We're going to cover quite a lot
of them in this course and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.680
give you a solid understanding and
practice in iOS development.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.830
In the next lesson, we're going to take
Pitch Perfect and add multiple views.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.060
We're going to set the groundwork so
it can record audio.
