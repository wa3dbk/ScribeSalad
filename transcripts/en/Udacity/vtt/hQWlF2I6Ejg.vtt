00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.194
Now that you've seen a couple examples of the slopes of pairs of lines that are

00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:08.924
perpendicular to one another, it'll be great if we could create a general

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:14.117
statement for how slopes of perpendicular lines are related. In one case, we had

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.043
a pair of perpendicular slopes where one was 1/2 and the other was negative 2.

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:25.287
And in the other case, we had the slopes 1 and negative 1 as perpendicular. So

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:31.066
using these as guidelines, or rather just as examples that should fit our

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:37.300
general rule, please create a general expression for m2 in terms of m1. This is

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:42.300
definitely kind of tricky, so just try out a couple things, and then see if

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:44.875
these pairs of slopes fit your formula.
