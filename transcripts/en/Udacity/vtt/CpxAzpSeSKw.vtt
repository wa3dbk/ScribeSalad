00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.835
We would get a horizontal line. If A is equal to 0, then this entire first term

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:09.474
is equal to 0, so our equation would just be by equals C. If we solve for y or

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:14.218
isolate y, we have the equation y equals C over B. So, y equals a constant,

00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:17.100
which we know is the form of a horizontal line.
