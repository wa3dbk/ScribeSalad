00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's do an exercise on this
idea of a dual optimal solution.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.360
Given that X, as shown here, is an
optimal solution to this linear program,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.310
I want you to find
the dual optimal solution.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.600
We'll let Y1 correspond to
this first constraint, and

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.330
Y2 correspond to the second.
