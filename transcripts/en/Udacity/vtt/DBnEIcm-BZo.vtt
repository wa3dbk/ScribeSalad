00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's complete the generalization.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to define missionaries and cannibals problem,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and we'll give it a 2 just so we can tell the two versions apart.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It takes the same arguments as before. You may need some initialization code to get going.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then I want the body of the function, the main part,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to just be a call to shortest&lt;u&gt;path&lt;u&gt;search with the appropriate arguments inserted.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you need to you can define other functions outside of here if that's necessary.
