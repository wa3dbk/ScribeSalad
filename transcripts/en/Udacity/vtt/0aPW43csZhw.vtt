00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.810
Now let us suppose that we get a new order in which a customer wants

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.080
a chair that weighs over 200 grams, costs at most $20, and has four legs.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.090
Given the specification, what configuration process can use this knowledge to

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.250
fill in the values of all the variables to satisfy the specification. So

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.050
the first thing the process might do is to write down all the constraints that

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.340
are given as part of the input specification. So

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.590
the mass is greater than 200 grams, the cost is less than $20, and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.190
the count of legs is 4. Now suppose that a configuration process has an abstract

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.280
plan which first decides on the value of the cost variable before it

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.360
decides on other variables. Let us also further suppose that this plan for

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.030
deciding the cost evenly distributes the cost between the greatest

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.790
components until unless specified otherwise by the specification. In this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.500
case the cost plan distributes this cost of $20 between the four components and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.990
assigns less than five for each one of them. Now we define an expanding plan.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.140
This is two aspects to it, refine and expand. Index and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.775
aspect we deal with the components instead of the chair as a whole. And

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:13.299
the define aspect we deal with more detailed variables that were not there in

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.910
the chair. Consider the component legs, for example. We already know the count,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.490
four, in the input specification. We know the cost, no more than $5

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.270
from the higher level plan. Now we can design by using the other two variables,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.520
25 grams and wood, for example. We can do the same for the other components.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.770
As we assign values to the variables of each of these components, we get

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.470
a complete arrangement of all these components here, with values assigned to

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.650
each of the variables. Given the specific values we assign to the variables for

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.990
each of the components, we can now compute whether the constraint given in

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.830
the input specification are satisfied. In this particular example,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.710
both the mass and the cost of the chair satisfy the input constraints. Note that

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.250
the define and expands step in this particular process might have operated

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.900
a little differently. It is also possible that define and expand step might say,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.680
the less, decide on the material before we decide on any of the other features.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.280
Plus within thin complex configuration process, different designers may

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.620
use different plans and different plans to find expansion mechanisms.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.390
Of course it is also possible that once we have a candidate solution,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.540
the candidate solution may not necessarily satisfy the input constraints. So

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.961
the cost may turn out to be more than $20, for example.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.950
In that case there are two options. Either we can iterate on the process,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.850
loading the cost, or we can go about changing the specification.
