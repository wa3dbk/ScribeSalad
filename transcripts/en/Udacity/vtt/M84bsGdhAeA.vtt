00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.740
The main advantage of the AsyncTask is that you get

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.630
to focus on your app logic, what you need to do

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.100
on the background thread, and what you need to do when

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.490
it comes back to the main thread. You don't have to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.026
worry about the details of threads and handlers. Of the methods

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:18.050
that I showed you, only doInBackground is required to be implemented.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.670
onPostExecute is optional as well as some other methods. For each

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.150
method, tell us whether it's on the main or background thread.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.260
You have a 50% chance of getting each one correct or a 100%

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.930
if you actually go check the java doc, so go do that now.
