00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The most straightforward way to do sensitivity analysis is to do it one at a time.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
One factor at a time, that is. For instance, there is an uncertainty concerning the initial data.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Actually, we may start here or we may start there

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and our knowledge is to where precisely we start may be limited.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There is an uncertainty concerning the initial data, or we may not be able

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to precisely control the start of the ramp.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If we start a little early, the total number of fish will be lower, as if we start a little late.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
As we change the single factors, sometimes the result goes up.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
As we change a single factor for instance, as in this case with the initial value,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and sometimes as we look at the upper limit of one of the factors,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the result may go down and it may go up as we look at the lower limit.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Like in this case for the time at which the ramp starts.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We can apply this to all factors that influence the result

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and check the degree by which they influence the result.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I am just using the base value and then for every factor

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
changing that factor to its upper limit and then to its lower limit.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That's a little lazy. At times, this can be too lazy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Most often, the other possible values for that factor will lead to sensible curves in that range,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but it may happen that sometimes you get very weird results for values in between.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Nonetheless, in the upcoming program, we're looking at the outermost values.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This code makes heavy use of dictionaries, a special feature of the Python language.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
A dictionary associates keys and values, so I can ask for the string initial_value and get 2 * 10^e5.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I can ask for the string maximumgrowthrate and retrieve the value 0.5.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is a nice trick to have all factors in one place, because we need to change them one at a time.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
These are the base values and here we specify the uncertainties.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So what we're saying here is that we know that the initial value of the amount of fish is between

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.000
2 * 10⁵ - 5 * 10⁴ tons and 2 * 10⁵ + 5 * 10⁴ tons and so on and so on.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This dictionary is simply to make things colorful.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The different factors will get different colors as well in the diagram.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
If you look at the code that we provide, you'll see more details about dictionaries in there.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In other programming languages, you may find dictionaries too,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or you may have to look for associative arrays or for maps or for hash tables.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
From the information provided in the code, you should be able

00:02:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to return the key of the most critical parameter in this variable.
