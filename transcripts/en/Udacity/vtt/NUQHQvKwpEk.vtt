00:00:00.135 --> 00:00:01.935
So we get to the last step of the technique in

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:05.142
which once we have generated test case specifications. We create test

00:00:05.142 --> 00:00:09.180
cases starting from this specifications. This step mainly consists in a

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.840
simple instantiation of frames and it's final result is a set of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.840
concrete tests. For our example, test frame number 36 that we

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.270
just saw, this will be the resulting test case, which has

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.490
the same ID, so that we can track it and will

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.520
specify to concrete values, not just the specification for the input elements.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.130
So string STR will have this value. And the integer size

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.720
will have this value. And these two values satisfy what this

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.260
test case specification was. Which was, having a string contain special

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.760
characters. Here, we have two special characters, like the new line

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.900
and the tab. And, we have a size which is greater

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.430
than zero, in particular, okay? And this is a test case

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.880
that we can actually run on our code. That we can

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.730
run on the split program. So, to summarize, we perform six steps

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.400
in which we went from a high level description of what the program does, to a

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.070
set of concrete test cases. And this is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.880
one of those test cases. So what, what we're

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.210
going to do next, we're going to do a mini-demo,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.260
in which we do this for real. We take

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.440
the program, we identify categories, choices, constraints, and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.800
we actually generate test frames and then test cases.
