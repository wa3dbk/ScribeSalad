00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.880
It turns out that login is a special case of the general bind operation that I

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.910
described to you, and it is a special

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.620
case in the following sense. Password that the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.560
user has for logging into the system at any point of time is used as the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.850
handshake key to start with. And username is

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.581
used as a client ID. So, to initiate the

00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:31.620
login session, the login process, the username given to the user

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.510
as the client ID, and the password as the HKC. But

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.980
other than that, it follows the same sequence of validating itself

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.660
to the server, and, similarly, validating the server to the client.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.790
And at the end of that validation of both the client and the server, what the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.000
server gives back to the login process, as I mentioned earlier, are a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.850
pair of tokens. The secret token, and the clear token. And these two tokens

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.910
have to be sent securely on the wire, which is insecure. So

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.130
what the server will do is encrypt these two using

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.810
password as the handshake key. And therefore,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.340
the login process can use the password to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.620
decrypt the message that comes back from the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.270
login server, and get these two tokens, secret

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.800
token and clear token. And these two tokens are kept by Venus for the rest of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.000
this login session. And as we know, once

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.710
we've gotten these two tokens because clear token

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.110
is a data structure that contains the handshake key needed by Venus

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.120
for establishing RPC session, the rest of the life is made for us.
