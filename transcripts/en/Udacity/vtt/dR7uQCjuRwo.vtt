00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.830
We're going to focus in on this idea of opposite polynomials. For two polynomial

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.185
expressions to be opposite, every corresponding pair of terms must opposite in

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:14.251
sign. We know addition is commutative so we can rewrite these terms by adding

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.486
the opposite. I'll move the negative x squared to the front, the 3x to the

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:22.990
middle, and the negative 8 to the end. Notice that when we move these terms

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.434
around, we just keep the sign with it. The three x's are positive, the eight is

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:32.110
still negative and the x squared is also still negative. Now we can definitely

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.026
see that these two polynomials are opposites. The x squared terms are opposites

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:39.933
since one is positive and the other is negative. The three x's are opposites

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.837
since one is negative and the other is positive And the eights are opposites,

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:48.030
since the first one's positive and the second one's negative. And the neat part

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.650
about opposite polynomials and rational expressions is that they simplify to

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.940
negative1 . We can think about factoring a negative 1 from each of these terms.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.960
So we'll have negative 1. Times the opposite sign of all those terms in the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.037
denominator. The numerator will just stay the same and we can think about

00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:09.696
multiplying it by a positive 1. Here we have a common factor in the numerator

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:14.072
and a denominator, so this all equals 1. And finally, since we have this

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:18.426
negative sign down in the denominator, our answer simplifies to negative 1.
