00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.976
And the beginning of this lesson, we talked about classes and methods, and

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:07.746
about the fact that a method should always belong to a particular class, who's

00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:14.748
objects are responsible for carrying it out. Sometimes that's not as easy as it

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:21.880
sounds. Let's go back to a program that you saw in lesson five. In the elevator

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.150
demo, we write in a number, and then we first checked whether it was a valid

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.630
integer, whether it was within range, and only then were we able to do any work

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.269
with it. It would be nice if we could put all of this code in a separate

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.153
method. And then I would like to call that method, in somewhat this fashion, so

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:44.865
I want to read a number between 1 and 18, I want to read it from this scanner

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:51.409
and I want to have the prompt to be floor. And of course the reason I want that

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.189
is, then I can reuse the readBetween method again, when I want to read some

00:00:55.189 --> 00:01:03.294
other value that's maybe between one and 100 and maybe it's the temperature. So

00:01:03.294 --> 00:01:06.570
like so many of us, the readBetween method is probably wondering, where do I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.220
belong? Well in which class do you think the readBetween method should be put?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.200
The system class? The scanner class? The ElevatorDemo, or maybe somewhere else.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.937
Just think about it and give me your best guess.
