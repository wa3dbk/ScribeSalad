00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.360
In this case like in many other cases, there's not just a

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.550
single right answer because you can build many test cases that will

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.730
satisfy this test specification. So for example, we could pick value 3

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.640
for a and value 9 for b. Those satisfy the specification because a

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.400
plus b is equal to 12 and therefore is greater than 0,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.470
and therefore this is a test case that implements this test specification.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.960
And in terms of results, what we expect to see is in

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.200
the case of a result greater than 0, the caller should be red,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.109
and the upper value should be 12. And obviously for this test

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.971
specification, we just need to pick two inputs such that the sum

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:33.674
of the two inputs is less than 0. So for example, we

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:37.125
could pick minus 5 and minus 8. The output color in this

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:40.230
case is going to be blue, and the output value is going to be

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.780
minus 13. So, what we just saw is basically how we can

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.060
go from a piece of code to a set of requirements, which

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.260
are the interesting aspects of the code that we want to exercise. How we

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.800
can satisfy the requirements by finding

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.700
the right test specifications, and then how

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.450
we can initiate the test specifications into actual test cases. And this is

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.010
what we will do in general when doing white books testing. And we'll

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.520
do things likely different way, depending on

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.230
the specific criteria that we are considering.
