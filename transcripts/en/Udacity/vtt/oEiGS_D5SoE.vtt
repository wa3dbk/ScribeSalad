00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.254
How's the app coming along?

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:03.210
&gt;&gt; It's going along really great.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.032
Our students just
reached a big milestone.

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:08.240
They were able to add all the vocabulary
words you gave us into the app.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.200
&gt;&gt; Wow,
it's really starting to take shape.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.540
&gt;&gt; I'm glad you like it.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.390
What should we do next?

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.150
&gt;&gt; I think our students are ready
to add images to the app now.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.975
We could have our designer
create illustrations for us.

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:20.420
Andrea, do you have any ideas for
images we could use?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.960
&gt;&gt; Yes.
For

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.610
the number words, I was thinking
we could use acorns since they're

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.080
significant in the Mewar culture.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.170
&gt;&gt; What do they stand for?

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.950
&gt;&gt; They used to be
a staple food source but

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.230
now they're a symbol for
connecting the past and the present.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.030
I was thinking we can use one acorn for
one, two for the number two and so on.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.290
&gt;&gt; Ooh, I really like that idea.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.370
So that takes care of
the numbers category.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700
Now what about the colors?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.750
&gt;&gt; What if we just use
the plain color and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.610
put it like in a circle or something.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we should use
the colors in a list item.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.790
&gt;&gt; I agree.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.460
&gt;&gt; What about family members?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.320
&gt;&gt; I have a good one for those.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.580
We can use pictures of my family.

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.790
&gt;&gt; Cool, thanks so
much for bringing these.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.630
I think this is going to add
a really personal touch to the app.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.260
&gt;&gt; I really like all these ideas.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.170
What about our final category, phrases?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.650
&gt;&gt; I can't think of any
images we can use for those.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.985
&gt;&gt; How about we just don't use images
then because there's no clear visual

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.625
that people would easily recognize.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:10.545
&gt;&gt; All right, I like that.

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:12.245
So that takes care of
all our categories.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.185
&gt;&gt; And
after they add in all those images,

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:17.065
we should do some visual improvements
in the app because right now,

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:19.195
the category screen is
looking a little plain.

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:20.745
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can definitely do that.

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:23.385
We can change up the colors,
change the font sizes,

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.265
and then maybe add some
padding to the list items?

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that will make it
look a lot more polished.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.510
I can't wait to see it next time.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.905
&gt;&gt; Let's revisit our course map.

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:32.974
Right now,
we're in lesson three out of four, so

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:37.200
to provide you with more detail on what
we're going to accomplish in the lesson.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.530
First, we're going to add
images to the app and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.000
then we're going to display
the correct images for

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.291
each word in the list and lastly, we're
going to add visual polish to the app.
