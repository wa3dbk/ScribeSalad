00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.195
I've given myself a whole bunch of room, so
that I can write out all the steps that

00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:07.945
I'm going to need to simply this
expression up here. So as we talked about

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:11.478
before, in other problems where we're
multiplying polynomials, to deal with

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:16.865
these 2, I'm going to start the 1st
term of the 1st polynomial and make sure

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:21.358
that I multiply it by every single term in
the 2nd polynomial. So I'm going to

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.907
write out all of those terms to start out.
So I have 3 terms here, reflecting the

00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:30.653
fact that I multiplied this term by each
of the 3 terms in this expression. Now

00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:35.839
that the -4x^2 is taken care of, I'll move
on to the x, since that's the next term in

00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.491
this 1st polynomial. Once again, I
should add on 3 more terms to what I'm

00:00:40.503 --> 00:00:45.372
building up here, 1 for each of these
terms, since I'm multiplying this by all

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:49.265
of them. So now I have 6 terms total,
which I can double check by counting them

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.425
all out. And this is actually a really
good way to check that you're on the right

00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:56.522
track, in terms of the spot in the problem
you're at. If I've already multiplied out

00:00:56.534 --> 00:01:00.679
the terms that I need for the first 2
terms of the 4 that I'm going to need

00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.143
to multiply. And there are 3 terms
that I'm multiplying each of them by,

00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:08.211
that'd make sense that I would have 2
times 3, or 6 terms total. Now let's

00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:12.458
continue, by multiplying all of these by
2y. And finally, we get to the last

00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:17.998
term in our 1st polynomial, the -6,
and now we have a super long expression.

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:22.223
This looks pretty miserable right now, but
hopefully, as we continue to simplify

00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:25.655
within the terms, then combine like terms,
things will get to look a little bit

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:30.543
nicer. Really though, in terms of new
material that this problem covered, our job is

00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:34.427
done. All that's left is for us to
simplify. Although, of course, this is a

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:38.031
particularly complicated simplification
process, because there are so many terms.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:43.498
We just have to be super careful. We end
up with this lovely, very long final

00:01:43.498 --> 00:02:00.459
answer of
-12x^2y^2+20x^3+3xy^2+6y^3-17x^2-10xy-18y^2+33x+6y-18.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:06.201
Wow. That was really difficult, and if you 
got this perfectly right, I am so proud

00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:10.573
of you. I actually made a couple of
mistakes myself when I was redoing the

00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:14.320
problem on the tablet here. You can see
actually, when I was doing my work, that I

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.983
had to put little check marks above all
the terms in this step before I got to the

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:22.515
final answer. The reason that I did that,
is that I wanted to make sure that as I

00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:26.973
rewrote each term down here, and combined
it with it's like terms, that I prevented

00:02:26.973 --> 00:02:32.285
myself from dealing with it again. So, I
put a little check mark above a term, when

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:36.565
I wrote it down here, that also let me
check that I actually had dealt with every

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:39.661
single term that I needed to deal with. I
think at this point, if you got this

00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:43.583
problem right, you have mastered
multiplication of polynomials.

00:02:43.674 --> 00:02:45.515
Congratulations. That's pretty huge.
