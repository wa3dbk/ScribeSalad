00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One is actually correct, and by virtue of what I told you before, you can figure it out that r has to be 1.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The reason is we know that r is between -1 and +1 so it can't be 3 or 2.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And 0 is kind of this pessimistic case where there's no relationship whatsoever

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
between the data but clearly this data fits in the line.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In fact, when it fits on the line no matter what the steepness of the line is if it isn't flat,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
if there's a positive relationship no matter how small or how large,

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
it's going to be 1--so this is the correct answer.
