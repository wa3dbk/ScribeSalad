00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.780
For f of x equals a to the x. When x increases by 1, f of x is multiplied by a.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.510
A here is the growth rate. And that means we can tell what the growth rate of

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.584
an exponential function will be by looking at its base. Which we can see, in

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:17.288
this equation, is a.
