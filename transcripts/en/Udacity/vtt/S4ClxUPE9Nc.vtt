00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.946
The way I solved this puzzle was to first align my right hand to the directions

00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:10.370
given in the beta, X south, Z west, and Y up. If I could do it, then I know the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.446
system was right-handed. Easy enough, my right hand aligns just fine. If I try

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:18.694
the same thing with my left hand, I can get 2 out of 3 axis to align but the

00:00:18.694 --> 00:00:22.760
third is always in the opposite direction. So, we know the beta version of

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.348
minecraft used right hand coordinates. I could solve the second half of the

00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:29.780
question by reorienting my right hand and again, noticing that the fingers can

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.916
properly align with the axes. So, it is also right-handed. However, you don't

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:38.186
really need to use your hands to figure this out. What happened within the world

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:41.976
itself was simply that the sun started to rise form a different direction. None

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:45.458
of the world's data had changed at all. The only thing that had changed was our

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:48.950
perception of which direction was east. Since the world was the same as before,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.702
the underlying coordinate system itself had not changed. Realizing this, I could

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:56.926
conclude that the released version is still right-handed, just like the beta,

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:59.393
but it never hurts to check with my right hand.
