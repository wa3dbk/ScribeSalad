Now that we have something that x is equal to, let's substitute back in for x.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.158
Remember, x equals e to the negative point five t. So, that means that e to the

00:00:10.158 --> 00:00:15.028
negative point five t equals five over 1,000. Now, the log, which is the

00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:19.674
inverse of e has a special notation. Do you remember what it is? If you need

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:23.871
to, you can check your calculator for a hint about what it might be.
