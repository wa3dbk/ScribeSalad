00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.828
Whenever we solved radical equations, we want to isolate this radical first. So

00:00:04.828 --> 00:00:09.898
notice here that we have plus 5 next to this radical. We'll want to undo this

00:00:09.898 --> 00:00:14.656
by subtracting 5 from both sides in order to get this by itself. Once we

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:18.550
subtract 5 from both sides, we'll have the cubed root of x plus 1 equal to

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.394
negative 2. Now, you don't want to square this equation to solve it. What do

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:27.862
you think we need to raise both sides by? We do need to raise it to a power,

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:32.090
but it's not 2 in this case. Think about what you need to do and then solve for

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.702
x. Be sure to check your answer and then, write your final answer over here. If

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:40.373
there's no solution, then type, ns.
