00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.870
Now don't worry. This is not your computer misbehavior. How many times have

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.710
you see often windows like what I'm showing you on this screen? Why does this

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.040
happen? The simple answer, programs are not

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.970
being hygienic, that is, they are not

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.920
cleaning up after themselves. Now, you can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.380
not fault the applications themselves. If an application

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.330
encounters an error or the user decides to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.700
kill an application, either ways, the system services

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.500
that the application was using have to have

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.750
a way of gracefully terminating and getting rid

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.210
of the state, that is the bread crumbs it created along the way. And it may

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.720
have strewn such breadcrumbs all over the computer.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.620
Some may be in data structures in memory,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.310
some may be visible, like the orphan windows that I'm showing you on the screen,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.750
and so on. Bottom line is these breadcrumbs are using

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.690
up precious resources in the computer. It may be visible resources like real

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.770
estate, on your display of failed

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.280
applications or invisible resources like memory leaks,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.530
network bandwidth that is being chewed up

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.470
by connections that are persisting beyod the life

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.510
of an application. Persistent data structures on

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.930
the disk and so on. LRVN and [UNKNOWN]

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.290
which is really and implementation of the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.590
RVN semantics on top of a persistent file

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.610
cache, took a very narrow view of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.340
recoverability, namely recovering the state that need to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.480
be persistent across system crashes. Either becaue

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.350
of software failure or power failure. But

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.030
imagine a system service that spans several

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.450
machines and network file server is a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.140
good example. NFS is suppoed to be

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.730
stateless which means that the client-server interaction

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.350
maintains no state at the server, pertaining to the clients. So what that means

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.770
is, taking down a file server and bringing

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.160
up The file server again does not need any

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.130
coordination with the clients that this file server

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.390
may be serving at any point of time. But

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.740
look at what is happening from the point

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.780
of view of the system, especially the client boxes

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.730
that are interacting with the file system. In

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.350
this case, there are clients all over the network

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.860
so far as this file server is concerned.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.770
And indirectly, and if a server is leaving breadcrumbs

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.780
all over the LAN because of accesses that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.340
a client may have made with a file server,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.900
in each one of these boxes. Imagine what

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.590
happens when a client program that initiated a file

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.130
system call quits in the middle of its

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.510
exchange with the file server? How will the file

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.390
server know how to clean up all the mess?

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.080
And in fact, with a stateless file server, doesn't even

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.360
know that there have been breadcrumbs created on this

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.520
node. The short answer is, the file system cannot know

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.330
about these kinds of breadcrumbs that have been created

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.630
all over the network. And I'm giving you a file

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.770
server as one example, but in general, all of

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.920
the system services that a client program is reliant on

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.200
create state, and this partial states may live

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.640
forever if an application crashes in the middle.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.810
Worse yet, you as a user may be

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.640
asked by the operating system to do some cleanup,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.470
not knowing what the cleanup may entail for

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.420
you, personally. Am I going to lose two hours

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.960
of work that I just completed? I have no idea what will happen when I click the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.940
"OK" button here.
