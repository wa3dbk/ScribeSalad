00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.407
According to American Psychiatric Association, and the new DSM-5 criteria, to

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:08.433
be diagnosed with major depressive disorder one must have a depressed mood, or

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:14.904
loss of interest, or pleasure in daily activities for at least. Two consecutive

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:19.572
weeks. Now remember that this mood must represent a change from the person's

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:25.020
baseline, that is, it has to be different from the way the person usually acts.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.924
They must meet at least five of nine specific symptoms associated with major

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:35.782
depression. Almost everyday for at least two weeks. A depressed, or sad, or

00:00:35.782 --> 00:00:41.486
listless mood, that stays low all day for several days. A reduced interest or

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:46.518
pleasure in doing anything. A significant change in body weight, that could be

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:51.645
either an increase or decrease in body weight. Sleep disturbances, sluggishness

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:55.635
or restlessness, daily fatigue or loss of energy, daily feelings of

00:00:55.635 --> 00:01:02.312
worthlessness, self-reproach or excessive guilt. Lack of ability to concentrate

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:09.165
or think clearly, recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Now most

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:14.056
importantly, these symptoms must significantly effect daily functioning, in

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:18.290
terms of both social and work related contexts, and also be a source of

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.871
distress. Notice that there's a wide variety of symptoms and a person must

00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:27.177
experience at least five of these symptoms to be diagnosed with major

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:31.882
depression. However, it's up to your doctor to diagnose you with major

00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:36.088
depression. So if you experience any of these symptoms, and are concerned about

00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:40.828
it, you should consult your doctor or counselor. Check out the PDF we put in

00:01:40.828 --> 00:01:45.000
the instructor's notes box. If you're interested in finding a therapist, this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.844
document can help you. Now you can see how these symptoms differ from our

00:01:48.844 --> 00:01:54.038
occasional sad or blue moods. This is a lot different than being rejected by

00:01:54.038 --> 00:01:57.622
someone, or doing poorly on an exam, or realizing you gained a few pounds last

00:01:57.622 --> 00:02:03.404
year, and the sad moods that can accompany those events. This can be different

00:02:03.404 --> 00:02:07.310
than being rejected by someone or doing poorly on an exam, or realizing you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.474
gained 15 pounds last year. These can be disappointing and produce negative

00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:16.038
moods, but as far as debilitating symptoms of major depressive disorder, they

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:18.140
just don't cut it.
