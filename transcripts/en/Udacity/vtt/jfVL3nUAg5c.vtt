00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.480
To understand this a little bit more, let's take a look at a very unique

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.200
scenario. Let's say we have a happy, little tank trudging along through a war

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.890
zone. The tank randomly fires a bullet into the air, which is actually aimed at

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.821
a bunch of little enemy soldiers camping out in the environment. The tank

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:17.312
itself has a small amount of hit points, say three or so. And the mortar in

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:19.706
flight will actually destroy all of these awesome little enemy soldiers up

00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:23.976
here. The question for you, then, is this. Which updates first in your update

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:28.108
loop? Let's say, for instance, the infantry update first. Well, this frame, the

00:00:28.108 --> 00:00:30.650
infantry, will shoot at the tank and kill the tank, and then the bullet will

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.709
update, killing the infantry. This would actually create a level playing field.

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:37.735
An alternative scenario, however, is what if the bullet updates first? The

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:40.660
bullet would actually kill the infantry and they wouldn't have time to update

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.052
and kill the tank. In this solution, the tank itself will actually be pretty

00:00:44.052 --> 00:00:47.525
happy trudging along through the war zone. Now, there's not really a good

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:51.710
pattern to attack all this. Most networked RTS games actually allow this to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.545
occur quite blindly, and simply ensure that all the clients in the simulation

00:00:55.545 --> 00:01:00.612
have the same ordering of entities. This ensures that one client doesn't update

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:03.372
infantry then bullet then tank and the other one do tank then bullet then

00:01:03.372 --> 00:01:07.502
infantry. I've also seen some games take a different approach to it, in a

00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:11.450
bucketized manner. So, for instance, you may go ahead and bucketize and say

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.650
that all of your infantry update first, and then all of your tanks and then all

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.100
of your bullets. If you ensure this grouped ordering of entities this allows

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.998
you to have the infantry get the upper hand on tanks which gets the upper hand

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:26.494
on those evil, evil bullets. With this layout the infantry would update first,

00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:29.361
killing the tank, and then the bullet would update this frame killing the

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:32.933
infantry, leaving a level playing field for next frame.
