00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.060
What I'm going to do now is I'm going to, we're going to build a

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.080
little web application that uses cookies to keep track of how many times

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.510
you've visited a website. And then I'll show you, you know, how

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.720
to use cookies in App Engine and some, some things we need to

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.309
keep in, keep in mind, so. This is the kind of template

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.462
I've been working from for App Engine stuff. First thing I want to do

00:00:20.462 --> 00:00:23.100
is, is just set the content type to text so we don't have

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.410
to deal with HTML for right now. Okay, so, I've added this line

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.760
here that gets a cookie called visits. The way this

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.320
works is we look at the request object, which is always

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.490
on self. The request object will have a cookies object, which

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.390
is a convenience thing that App Engine did for us, it

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.420
parsed our HTP hatters and it threw all of the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.390
cookies into this dictionary-like object and we can call get on

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.050
it which you know, distinct from this get, of course. This

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.560
is a function we call in dictionaries to check to see

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.870
if a key is in the dictionary and if it is, we

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.600
get the value of that key. And if it's not, we get the

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.340
default which we'll set to zero. What I want to do is I want

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.070
to print through our user how many times we visited the site. Okay,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.970
so I added this line to just write to the user you've

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.700
been here %s times. Remember our

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.440
string substitution? And we'll print visits there.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.640
So let's go ahead and give this a test in our browser. And

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.110
I'm, I've loaded my page and it says I've been here zero times.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.240
And if I reload the page over and over, it still says zero

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.330
times because we're not doing any counting, we're just printing the number zero

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.890
over and over. So let's go ahead and store how many times we've

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.510
been to the site in a cookie. So the way we do this

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.610
first we're going to take the number of visits we have and we're going to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690
increment it by one. Visits plus equals one and then we're going to store

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.660
the number of visits in this cookie called visits so the next time

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.460
we come back we'll get it. The way we set a cookie in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.830
App Engine is we just set the cookie header. Okay,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.000
so I added two more lines here. Visits plus equals 1,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.980
which will increment the visits count that we got from our

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.020
cookie, and then we're going to set the Cookie. So the way

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.570
we do that is on the response object, there is

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.230
a headers object. You know, just like when we set the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.260
Content Type. And now we want to, we're going to call add_header. We

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.580
could treat it like a dictionary, but add_header here is special

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.520
because remember, you can have multiple headers with the same name,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.400
and so if you used a dictionary syntax, you'd overwrite the header.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.530
So in this case, we're going to use add_header, that's what we're going to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.710
use for cookies here. So we're going to use the Set-Cookie header, and

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.670
I'm just going to use, I'm not going to worry about domain and path

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.710
right now. That's not what we're trying to experiment with here and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.430
we're going to say, visits equals %s, and we're going to include our Visits

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.650
parameter. All right, so let's see if that works. We're on our,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.620
our browser and you know when I, and I've

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.190
reloaded the page. And so we see I've been

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.130
here one time, and I reload the page again.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.019
Ooh, and we see an error, and this makes sense.

00:02:45.178 --> 00:02:48.181
Need a string, int found on visits plus equals

00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:52.204
1. Cookies you know, the browser doesn't care what datatype

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:54.040
our cookie is here we just says that it's,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.845
you know, it's basically this, this, this string, this blob

00:02:56.845 --> 00:02:58.477
of data and here I am treating it like an

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:00.862
integer. So let's, let's go ahead and update this code to

00:03:00.862 --> 00:03:04.472
make this work properly for strings. Okay, so, we've improved

00:03:04.472 --> 00:03:07.320
our code a little bit here. I changed our, our default

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.710
zero to the string zero and so that this next

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.840
line will work without exceptions. If visits.isdigit, remember that checks to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.260
see if visits is made up of only, only digits in

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.250
which case we can safely convert it to an integer and

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.870
we add one to it. So we increment visits every time,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.490
otherwise we just set visits to zero and that's what we print.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.568
Okay, so let's give this a whirl. So now we've got our

00:03:31.568 --> 00:03:33.920
page here, and I re-load it, the arrow went away, and we

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.820
can see this counting up. Pretty neat huh, so that count is

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.730
stored in a cookie in this browser. The server has no idea

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.660
what the count is, so, let's go ahead and add some functionality

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.082
to further my agenda. Now what we want to do, is, is let's,

00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:51.060
let's do something with this cookie value. Let's say we want to reward users who

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.638
have been to our website 100 times with a special message of thanks. So

00:03:56.638 --> 00:04:01.621
let's, let's do it like let's, let's make some changes here. We'll say if

00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:06.945
visits is greater than 100, self.write you are

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:12.470
the best ever. And for everybody else, we'll just

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.590
tell them how many times they've been here. Let's see this in action.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.019
Actually so we want to, we want to do it on 100, but let's go ahead

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.540
and, and test it on ten so we don't have to reload the

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.640
page 100 times, just to make sure this works. Okay, so I'm going to save

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.560
this, and we're going to go to our browser and give it a shot.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.510
Conveniently I'm at nine times we, reload ten times. Hah greater than ten after

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.264
I reloaded it switched to you are the best ever. Great, we feel very

00:04:34.264 --> 00:04:37.758
good let's go back to our code and change that ten to a 100.

00:04:37.758 --> 00:04:39.830
So change that 10 to a 100, we go back to

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.185
our browser, we keep reloading again. Okay, so we really want to see

00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:48.510
our, our special message. But it's going to take us awhile to

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.560
get there, we're going to have to sit here and reload the page.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.580
Actually let's make this 100,000, okay? We're never going to get there,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.330
we're going to have to be a super loyal user to, to get

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.340
up to that amount. So, what I'd like you to do

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.760
is think about, how we might cheat the system a little bit.
