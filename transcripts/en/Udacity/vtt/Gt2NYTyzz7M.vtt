00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.850
So when talking about the level of
assurance that we have in the system and

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.710
we said, well, we can do testing.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.230
You can do formal verification.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.700
So let's talk about why that is harder,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.330
some of the challenges that we may
face when we're trying to do that.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.520
Well, when you're doing tests,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.600
you have to then rate the right
set of tests to your test cases.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.210
Test cases are supposed to show
the existence of a problem.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.290
If you don't have a good
set of these test cases,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.840
then a problem that you may
have may go undiscovered.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.140
In other words you want to
have good code coverage.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.450
You won't execute the code that we have
in the software system and the kind of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.760
execution paths we may be able to take
when the system is actually deployed.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.670
The problem with this is that there
could be a very large impact on

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.750
exponential number of different
executions that are possible.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.345
And these different execution paths
we're talking about could change when we

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:57.930
have different execution environments.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.890
So we talked about
the other kind of testing,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.990
which is the penetration testing, okay.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.690
So that is the adversary actually or
somebody else trying to find one way.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.830
Here when we're doing
testing as a good guide,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.810
we have to make sure that every possible
execution path we know that is good.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.480
So you have the burden of showing that
no matter how the system executes,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.060
things will not go wrong.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.770
If you're doing Pen testing,
the problem is different.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.730
You're not concerned about
every possible execution path.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.660
You're actually concerned about some
execution path where a problem shows up,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.050
some vulnerability you discover
that can be exploited.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.860
One way we do that is if ethical,
hopefully, hackers,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.310
they attempt to defeat the security
measures that we have in place.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.120
If they're successful that means
that we have a problem with

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.340
the security measures that
we use in our system, okay?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.470
If they can't find any, that doesn't
mean that somebody else can't find them

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.990
two weeks from today, but if they
can defeat the security measures,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.690
then we know that we have a problem.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.610
Keep in mind that,
even with pen testing, as in testing,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.550
we only talking about showing the
existence of a problem that is there.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.810
That a problem exists.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.660
We can never demonstrate
the absence of a problem.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.840
And that is formal verification.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.980
Formal verification is essentially
the mathematical specification of what

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.880
the program is supposed to do, and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.720
what security assertions have to hold,
what security properties have to hold.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.450
And it's a proof, and the proof is about
the correct behavior of the program or

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.360
any executions that
the program may go through.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.100
Through.
So, how can we do this?

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.200
Well, there are automated
theorem proving techniques,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.250
things like model checking and all.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.355
What they typically do is,
at our program or code that we have,

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:52.370
we'll have a bunch of state variables
with some initial assignment or values.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.380
And program instructions or
statements or

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.690
the code that we have actually
change these state variables.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.640
Depending on what the instruction or
the statement is,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.520
it's maybe assigning new variables or

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.900
altering, or computing and
things like that, whatever it is doing.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.145
But the state changes and
then we have some boolean predicates.

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:19.065
The correctness is sort of captured
in predicates that hold on the state

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:20.495
variables that we have.

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:25.235
And so essentially, model checking or
theorem proving, basically is saying

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:30.695
that certain security assertion we have
is going to hold as the program executes

00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:33.925
or as the state variables change,
due to the execution of the program.

00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:35.670
The assertions remain true.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.850
Okay, if you can show that for
everything that the program does

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.339
of course, all of its statements,
starting in some initial state.

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.804
That is a proof of correctness, or

00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:49.720
formal verification that whatever
that we wanted actually holds.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.330
Well the problem is that model checking,
the same sort of difficulty we had with

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.050
testing is that the state
space can actually explode.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.470
And worst case complexity is,again,
exponential.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.230
However, there are strides being
made in this field, Verification.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.400
The problem that we have with it is
would it scale to really large systems.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.730
And your operating system, of course,
is one of those large systems.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.060
It doesn't quite scale
to that size system,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.649
but as I said, strides are being made.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.980
We can check where these
kind of properties, and

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.640
this kind of work actually.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.640
So the model checking pioneers won the
highest award that computer science has,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.630
the Turing Award, in particular in 2007.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.960
Because of the importance or impact this
kind of work could have in, not just

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.360
building or writing software that
implements the functionality we desire,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.630
but also implements the security
requirements that we want to have or

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.430
security properties that we
want to have in the system.
