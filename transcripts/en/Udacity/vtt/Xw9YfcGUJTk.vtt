00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.965
Key mapping is a technique that game developers use, to allow players to

00:00:02.965 --> 00:00:07.360
customize their experience in playing the game. So for instance, if they don't

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.888
like moving around using WASD, they can shift over their controls to use the

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:15.102
arrow keys instead. Now looking at the grids controls, we can see a number of

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:19.359
different potential input methods that we need to keep track of. For example,

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.495
we can move around with WASD, but we allow two different variations for how to

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:26.297
shoot. So at some point in the future, we may have a need to change how our

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.998
keys are laid out. This means, that somewhere in our code we need to have the

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:35.800
ability to variably modify what key corresponds to what action.
