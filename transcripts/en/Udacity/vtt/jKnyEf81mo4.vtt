00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.040
Some well known harmful teratogens
are viruses such as the flu or rubella.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.490
Alcohol, nicotine, prescription drugs,
such as anti-depressants, or radiation.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.007
It's interesting that all of these
are particularly dangerous,

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.250
during certain periods
of pre-natal development.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.380
Viruses have a major impact
early on in pregnancy.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.520
But not so much towards the end.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.960
Specifically, if a mom get the flu
between month four and six of pregnancy,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.200
the risk of schizophrenia increases
for the child later in life.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.130
Now the odds only go from about 1% to 4%,
but it's a significant increase.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.270
In addition, nicotine exposure
from maternal smoking

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.420
can lead to low birth weight
or even still birth.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.670
So this shows that the developing brain

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.490
is really vulnerable to both environmental
stimulation and toxic chemicals.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.020
That's why pre-natal care
is so important to a developing fetus.
