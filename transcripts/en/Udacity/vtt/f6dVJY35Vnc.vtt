00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.360
The second major kind of relationship that you use in

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.340
UML class model diagrams is generalization. Generalization is

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.500
also indicated by a solid line, but in this case the line ends with a triangle.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.230
The class rectangle that's adjacent to the triangle is the superclass or

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.780
parent class. And the other class rectangle is the child class or subclass.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.020
The semantic import of generalization is that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.270
all instances of the subclass are also instances of the parent class. That is

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.830
there's a subset relationship. Let me warn you though that generalization is

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.890
not the same as inheritance in object oriented programming languages.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.600
Inheritance is an implementation technique, generalization is a modeling,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.750
approach. We'll see how that difference plays out later in the course.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.120
In UML, generalization supports both multiple parent classes for

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.670
a given class and multiple child classes for a given parent class. Moreover,

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.460
you can specify discriminators. That is names of groups of subclasses.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.860
So here's an example of the UML class model diagram in

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.260
which generalization is illustrated. We have a superclass called Vehicle.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.660
Note that it's got four lines coming into it each with an open triangle so

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.525
it's got four sub-classes. Those sub-classes are wind powered vehicle,

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:45.220
motor-powered vehicle, land vehicle and water vehicle.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.510
Notice also that we have two grandchild classes.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.640
We have trucks and we have sailboats. So let's think for a minute

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.870
about trucks. Trucks are motor powered vehicles are motor powered vehicles but

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.600
they're also land vehicles, that is truck has two parent classes.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.520
Similarly sailboat is a wind powered vehicle and a water vehicle so

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.750
its got two parent classes as well. With respect to the parent level.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.100
We have two categories of sub-classes. We have a category related to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.790
the power that moves the vehicle, it might be wind or

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.710
it might be motor. And we have a category having this labeled here as venue,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.130
indicating where the vehicle does its moving. Is it on land or is it on water?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.230
Also visible in this diagram are some properties in curly braces.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.260
Those properties indicate properties of the sub-classes. If a parent class has

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.950
two child classes, and instances can belong to both of the child classes.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.570
We want to use the overlapping property. If that

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.100
can't be the case that is if a given instance can only belong to one child,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.490
we say that those particular sub-classes are disjoint,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.180
their members belong to one of the child classes not the other and. But

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.280
by our definition of generalization, the instances do belong to the,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.400
to the parent class. A second kind of constrained or

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.840
property we might want to express is whether or

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.270
not the set, of child classes covers all of the instances or not.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.100
If that's the case we say, we would use the, property, complete, and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.480
otherwise we would say incomplete. Why might a modeling situation be incomplete?

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.810
Well you might have some weird hybrid vehicle that doesn't belong to any of the.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.000
The child classes, but nevertheless we want to have an instance that,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420
that recognizes it, or, or models it, say the Segway, for example.
