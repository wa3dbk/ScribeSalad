00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.215
The 0 lies between 1.44 and 1.45. Now remember, we started out just knowing

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:10.304
that the 0 was between 1 and 2. That's a pretty huge range, considering how

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:14.364
precise, or how accurate, we've gotten now. So the more information we have,

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:17.640
the better the intermediate value theorem can help us, come up with a really

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.523
close answer, or a really close approximation for x.
