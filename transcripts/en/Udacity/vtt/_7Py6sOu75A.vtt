00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.670
And if we lay it out graphically, it looks like a pipe and filters.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.510
The filters are the components along the way and

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.590
the pipes are the little lines connecting them.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.760
And, and, and this, this form, will indeed,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.999
solve the problem and yet it's much different than the previous one.

00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:23.170
Well, Parnas also laid out two other solutions,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.780
which I want to briefly describe to you and they're probably many more.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.820
&gt;&gt; Is there a problem necessarily because the pipe and filter doesn't have

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.930
any central storage location that we're not keeping that data?

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.370
Do we need to have good like logging systems, for

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.280
instance, if we use that type of approach because the data isn't persistent,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.320
maybe like it would be with a shared data model?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.120
&gt;&gt; Well, okay, so

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.930
I haven't really laid out what the requirements of the problem are, okay?

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.530
And even in the shared data solution, that's in memory and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.110
it's going to go away when the process is over.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.360
Now, we could imagine adding in or being more explicit about what

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.260
the requirements are and whether we need to persist them, okay.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.560
And let's, let's come back to that in a couple of minutes.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.070
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.302
First I'd like to go over a couple of other solutions that Parnas proposes.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:18.390
The next one to consider is called the Abstract Data Type or

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.150
ADT solution and this is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.410
breaking the system into components based upon important data structures.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.050
So when we had the shared memory solution,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.530
that was breaking things into components based upon functions and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.780
likewise, the pipe and filter was more breaking it into functions.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.350
Here we're thinking in terms of the data first.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.820
We're going to hide the represent,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.680
representations of those datas behind abstract interfaces.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.200
That is we have a function called interface to it and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.930
how exactly we store this stuff away is all hidden from the other components.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.978
The components holding the data, of course,

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:55.290
are also going to have some operations available to them.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.090
In a sense, this is a precursor to an object oriented approach.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.140
It's not, it was, it was first developed before object oriented

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.440
languages became popular but many of the features that ADTs have,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.890
have been incorporated into object oriented solutions to things
