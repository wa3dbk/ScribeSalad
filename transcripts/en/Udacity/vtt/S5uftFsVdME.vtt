00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.636
One thing we know about the stress response, is some of the effects it has on

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:07.712
the brain. If you remember from lesson three about the brain, or even our

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:12.862
memory lesson, we know that it's important for learning and memory. In fact,

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:16.502
the hippocampus has a large number of receptors for cortisol, which again, is

00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:21.703
the stress hormone. We see the stress-related release of cortisol can cause

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:27.557
dendrites in the hippocampus to shrink. Now, if you remember from Lesson three,

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:32.546
dendrites are what come off of a neuron to collect information. This shrinkage

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:37.335
can interfere with several types of memory. Moreover, we see that stress can

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:42.894
decrease the amount of neurogenesis. So, new neural growth in the hippocampus,

00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:47.722
which in turn inhibits synaptic plasticity, which will interfere with learning

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:53.630
and memory. So, in short, stress is bad for learning and memory.
