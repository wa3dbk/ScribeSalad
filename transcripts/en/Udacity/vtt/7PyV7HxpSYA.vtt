00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.700
I'd like you to get started by looking at the structure

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.100
and the summary of the Yerger data set on your own

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.490
computer. You may want to pause the video now to give yourself

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.920
some time to load in the data set and to download it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.710
first from the instructor notes. This Yerger data set contains over

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.190
2000 observations. For nine different

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.050
variables. The observations are for households

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.070
that buy Dannon yogurt over time. Now one thing that you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.038
might notice is that most of the variables in here are integers.

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:29.110
But I want to convert one of the variables to a factor, and

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.540
that's the ID variable. We'll see how this comes in handy later

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.060
in the course. But just make sure it says factor right here

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.396
on your data set as well. If ID doesn't say factor for

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:42.405
the type of variable, make sure you run this command in order

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:45.450
to change ID to a factor variable. Once you've done all this,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.840
I want you to create a histogram of the Yogurt prices. Copy

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.410
and paste your R code in to the R chunk on the quiz

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.960
screen that will appear here. And then write a

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.420
few sentences about what you notice. So that way

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.100
we can be consistent as we work through the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.080
data set together. I want you to be sure to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.030
read in the data set into the variable called

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.980
Yo. You can, of course, use other variable names.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.540
But our auto grader will only accept answers for

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.820
programming assignments that have this data frame labeled as Yo.
