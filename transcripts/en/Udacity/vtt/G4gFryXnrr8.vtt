00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.960
Now that we know how to create a dataframe,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.380
why don't we talk about how we can access the data.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.700
We can operate on specific columns by calling on them as if they were a key in

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.920
the dictionary.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.310
For example, if we wanted just the name column of this dataframe,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.340
I could simply type df name.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.200
I could also grab more than one column by passing in a list of

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.280
column names as opposed to just one column name.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.130
For example, say I wanted the name and age columns.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.680
I could say df name, age.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.060
I can also call on specific rows by calling the dataframe objects load

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.590
method and passing the row index as an argument.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.320
For example, if I only wanted the row corresponding to passenger Braund,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.297
whose index is a, I could simply say df.loc a.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.862
We can also use true false statements regarding columns of the dataframe to

00:00:53.862 --> 00:00:55.670
subset the dataframe.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.010
For example let's say I wanted rows of this dataframe only

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.700
where the passenger age was greater than or equal to 30.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.436
I could simply say, df where df age greater than or equal to 30.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:16.805
You can see here that I've only picked out rows b and d,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:20.400
which were the rows where our passenger is in fact older than 30.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.110
This ability to subset our dataframe based on true false statements in

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.400
the index is not limited to the entire row.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.110
I can also perform this operation on particular columns.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.350
For example let's say I only wanted this survived information for

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.840
these two rows, b and d.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.368
I can simply say, df survived df age greater than or equal to 30.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.873
Let's pick apart what this statement is

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:45.576
doing since it's a little bit complicated.

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:48.890
First, df survived is going to

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.350
pick out only the survived column of our dataframe.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.510
This section here says,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.080
I basically only want the indices where df age is great than or equal to 30.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.170
Then I say, of this array of values, give me only the values where

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.960
the indices are equal to the indices where this statement is true.
