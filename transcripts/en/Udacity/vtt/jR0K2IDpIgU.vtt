00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.380
Let's try your hand at a quiz. I'm going
to draw a bunch of shapes and I want you

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.516
to find the shape, or images, that have an
area shaded as 1/5. Check all the images

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:12.030
where the shaded area is 1/5 of the total
area. Assume that the circle has been

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.739
split up into equal parts, it might be
hard to tell.
