00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Norvig] Now, by all means, you should use the library functions like random.shuffle.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's what they're there for.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But I'm going to allow a little bit of a diversion here

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because the shuffle algorithm is one that's important to me personally.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It was the first nontrivial algorithm that I came up with on my own when I was in high school

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and one of the first cases where I saw that my teacher was just completely wrong.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here's the algorithm that my teacher was trying to describe to me.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Of course, I went to high school in the Dark Ages before there was any Python,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so it wasn't written in exactly this language,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but I've translated it into Python to make sense to you.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Here's what the algorithm does.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It says we're going to keep track with an array of which items have been swapped so far,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and then until they've all been swapped at least once,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we're going to generate 2 random indices into that array and then swap them

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and record the fact that they were both swapped

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and keep going until all the items have been swapped at least once.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So it looks like this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Again, we have this deck of cards

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and then we have a parallel array of the same length

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which tells us whether we've been swapped or not,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and that starts out as being all false, while this one starts out being cards.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And then we go through and we pick out random numbers.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So say we pick out I and J as being here and here,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and say we have a 9 of diamonds there.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Then we're going to just swap the 2.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And so we cross those out.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We now have the 7 of spades there and the 9 of diamonds there,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and we mark the 2 spots as being swapped.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So now this one is true and this one is true.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Those 2 spots have been swapped, and then we keep on going

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
until all the elements of swapped are all equal to true. Then we know we're done.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So that's what my teacher was trying to sell to me that day in high school.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I was sitting in the back, and I just woke up and I said,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"That can't be right."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I just had this visceral reaction that said, "I can see what the algorithm does,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
"and I know it swaps everything, but it just seems too inefficient."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
"It has this loop that keeps on going, and it's not a for loop, it's a while loop."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And it just seemed to me that it was possible that this loop could go forever.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Depending on the choice of random numbers,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
this might never terminate, and that just seemed wrong.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It seemed like there was a much better way.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And in my head I came up with the shuffle algorithm that we showed before.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Knuth calls it Algorithm P for permutation.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It just seemed like that was the simple and correct way,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and this was just too complicated, and that really bothered me.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I thought that an algorithm should be guaranteed to terminate.
