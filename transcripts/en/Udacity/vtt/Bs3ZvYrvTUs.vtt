00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is the last two could work. Let's go through the other answers.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first one, we're encrypting using a1 the value of X0

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
concatenating that with encrypting X0 using b0.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This means if the evaluator here is either a1 or b0, they would be able to learn the value of X0.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That would enable the evaluator to decrypt more than one entry in this truth table

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
if the other entries were encrypted the same way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The second possibility has a similar problem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If the evaluator knows a1, they can obtain the value of  X0,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that's not secure because they can decrypt two outputs in this table.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The other two make it so that obtaining X0 depends on both keys.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It depends on knowing both a1 and b0.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
An evaluator who knows only one of those can't determine the key for this encryption

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
since this is the XOR of those two values and it depends on both of them.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They also couldn't do both of these.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
They could do the first one if they know a1, but they just get an encrypted value there,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and they couldn't decrypt the second one to get the value of X0--so, either of these can work.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This first one is going to be more efficient because it only involves one encryption.

00:01:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
There might be other ways to combine the keys that would be better and provide more security.
