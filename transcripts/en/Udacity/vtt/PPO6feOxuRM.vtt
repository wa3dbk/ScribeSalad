00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my solution to the findtags problem.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I decided to do it just using regular expressions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Why don't I make that explicit and import the regular expression module,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but then I broke up my regular expression, because they can get long and complicated.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I said there is a part where I'm parsing the parameters,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and that's one or more word characters, an equal sign, and then a quoted string.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
A quote character, 0 or more non-quote characters, followed by a quote character.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Then that whole thing we can have zero or more parameters.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The thing that made it complicated is I've got to throw in optional spaces in multiple positions--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
" \s* " means zero or more spaces.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That defines a set of parameters.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then the tag is the angle bracket, maybe some spaces, word character--

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
like the a or the table tag, then the parameters, then maybe some more spaces,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and then the close. The close is an angle bracket.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I allowed an optional slash-angle bracket there.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now that I've defined this regular expression in tags,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
then I just re.findall of the tags in the text.
