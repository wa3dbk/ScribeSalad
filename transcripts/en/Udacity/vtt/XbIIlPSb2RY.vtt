00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.340
Now, let's talk about scales for categorical data. A

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.910
categorical scale provides visual separation for different groups. And it

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.750
often works in tandem with a numerical scale, as

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.495
we'll see here when we plot home runs on the

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:16.050
y-axis. A bar plot, for example, can use a

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.982
categorical scale on the x-axis, and a numerical scale on

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:22.690
the y-axis. So let's say that we were measuring home

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.070
runs by position. The positions we've used here are unordered,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.940
but you can imagine that if we have ordinal

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.410
data, we'd want these categories represented in the order that

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.380
the ordinal data suggests. That will make it easier to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.360
compare and contrast your bars, or whatever encoding that you've

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.010
chosen to represent your data. Finally, let's talk about

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.060
time series data. The thing is, we can measure time

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.910
with various different granularities. So we could use months or

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.230
days or years on this x-axis, which will let us

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.670
visualize our data in a discreet way. Depending

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.100
on what you're trying to communicate with your data

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.200
You might use a different time scale here.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.390
So, if you're looking at fluctuations that happen on

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.780
a very short time scale, days are more

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.910
appropriate, but if we're looking at long term trends,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.190
we may want to look at data on a month to month or year to year basis.
