00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.990
Writing these out as equations so

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.540
the prediction can be
thought of as this way.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.730
What is the next predicted state
of the object here, here and

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.980
back to x of t given t minus 1,
given all the previous measurements?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.600
Okay?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.210
So you see here that it says
given y from 0 to t minus 1 so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.630
those are all the measurements up until
before t, make a prediction at time t.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.690
Correction is again I want
a distribution, remember I'm

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.290
coming up with a probability
distribution of x t, given what's new.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.080
Well what's new is I have
my new measurement, okay?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.800
So basically, this was my prediction
based upon my measurements up until t.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.390
Then when I'm done,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.100
I should have a prediction
including the current measurement.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.840
So basically, the tracking is this
propagating what's called as I said

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.490
the posterior distribution, posterior
density of state, given the measurement.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.630
So this term here,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.570
this is my posterior because it's after
I've taken the measurement at time t.
