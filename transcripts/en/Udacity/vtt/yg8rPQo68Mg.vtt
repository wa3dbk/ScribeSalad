00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.910
Let's use our order of operations to help us solve this problem. We should solve

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:07.716
this problem going from left to right following the hierarchy of the order of

00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:11.526
operations. Parenthesis and brackets serve as containers, and this should be

00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:15.361
evaluated before we do any operations onto them. Brackets are typically used

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:18.884
only if they have parenthesis inside them, but we evaluate them the same way. We

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:22.508
start at the very inside and they work a way out. I'm going to simplify this

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.320
negative of 5 squared. I know this 5 squared only goes with the power, so I have

00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:31.878
25 or negative 25. Now, I simplify this parenthesis, and then I add negative 20

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.263
to 3. I lose my brackets because I no longer have parenthesis. I just have

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:40.994
negative 17, so I write that in parenthesis. I can't simplify this parenthesis

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:45.602
anymore, so now I should go back and do my order of operations. Let's look for

00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:50.721
powers. I have powers here and here, so I should simplify these numbers. I want

00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:55.148
to be very careful. I have the negative of 3 squared, and the negative of 2

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.117
squared. I only square the 3 and I only square the 2. So, I have negative 9,

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:02.409
negative 17, and negative 4. Adding the opposite is the same thing as

00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:06.742
subtraction, that's why I can write negative 17. Finally, I can add all these

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:11.307
negative numbers up, and I'll get my final answer. And I get negative 30. You

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:15.114
can think of doing parentheses and brackets first. We don't include them in our

00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:19.027
order of operations because, well, they're not actually operations. They're just

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.572
containers.
