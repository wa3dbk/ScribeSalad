00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.710
Because it's being created within an activity, it can be

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.400
terminated as simply as rotating the phone into a different

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.710
orientation. So, should only ever be used for tasks whose

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.050
lifecycle is tied to the host activity, and is expected

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.420
to run for only a second or two. On mobile,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.100
it's unwise to assume that even the most trivial network

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.680
access is going to happen quickly. So a better approach

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.770
would be to use a service. An application component without

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.220
the UI that's less likely to be

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.820
interrupted. Possibly scheduled using an inexact repeating alarm.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.860
Even better, Android has a specialized solution know

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.170
as Async Adapter. And it's designed especially to schedule

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.700
your background data syncs as efficiently as possible. Better

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.830
still would be using Google Cloud Messaging. This let's

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.740
you notify your Async Adapter of changes on the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.460
server side. So you're only ever initiating network requests

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.510
from your app when you know there's something to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.030
be updated on the server. For now we're concentrating

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.340
on making our app work when it's in the foreground. But we'll return to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.340
look at these approaches to invisibly updating

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.890
your app from the background a little

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.200
later. For now, keep in mind that the Refresh button and the new thread

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.530
solution is just a place holder while we hook up the rest of the app.
