00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.100
For the Mountain View postal code 94043,
this is what the query would look like.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.510
You could have also used
94043 comma USA and

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.690
that would have given
us the same result.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.720
We set the mode to be JSON format.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.810
In reality, you actually don't
need this parameter because this

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.280
API sends back JSON data by default.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.430
But just to be sure,
we set this parameter.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.900
Then we set the temperature
units to be in metric, and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.160
the count param to be 7
days of forecast data.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.190
Let's take this URL and
use it in our app.
