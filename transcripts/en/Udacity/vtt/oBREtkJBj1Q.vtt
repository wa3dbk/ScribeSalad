00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.632
For this quiz, your goal is to finish the Appetizer class. We've provided the

00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:07.062
complete code for the MainDish and the start for the Appetizer's class. Your

00:00:07.062 --> 00:00:10.764
goal is to finish the Appetizer class to get the behavior shown. So, we'll

00:00:10.764 --> 00:00:15.414
import both MainDish and Appetizer from the dish dot pie module. We can create

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:19.962
an Appetizer instance, passing in a name and a price. As well as an optional

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:24.516
parameter, where we've given a value for the parameter serves to be 23, instead

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:30.416
of the default value, which is 1. And we can see that prints out as Fried Python

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:34.558
$101.30. We can create another Appetizer, the Call-a-Mari dish, which is even

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:38.365
better than the call a method dish, which is vegetarian and serves three. We see

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:42.365
we get the star here, showing that it's a vegetarian dish. We can also create

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:46.269
main dishes and you don't have to do anything to change the MainDish code, but

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.182
you should preserve this behavior. So, see if you can modify the appetizer class

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:53.650
to get all the behavior I've shown here. You'll note that I've used somethings

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.770
in the MainDish class you might not have seen before. But I think you'll still

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.123
be able to figure out how to do this.
