The easiest but
also the slowest method to get and

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.590
render the data we need is AJAX.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.140
Not only does it require an extra
HTTP request but the request won't

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.079
be fired until after the app's
JavaScript has been downloaded and run.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.210
On a fast WiFi connection or
even 3G, it's no big deal but

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.160
on 2G or even 3G it could add
a second or more to the app.
