00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.172
The first sign change in f of x that we see on the table, happens between the x

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:09.854
values of negative 2 and negative 1. Since f of x between these 2x values is

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:14.408
moving from 21 to negative 1. So, we see that over here on the graph from it

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:18.745
dropping from this positive value in f of x to the negative value. That means

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:23.829
there must be an x intercept between negative 2 and negative 1. The x intercept

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.609
up to the right, we can see on the table, must happen between 1 and 2 on the x

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.402
axis. Since f of x here is switching from negative 3 and when x equals 1 to 5

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:37.484
when x equals 2.
