00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.906
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As much as we've talked about Grant, we haven't talked about his actual

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:08.365
product that much. I think it's time that we discuss some of the specifics of

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:13.050
wiper blade engineering. Now in general, Grant aims to have his wiper blades be

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.506
exactly 2.5 centimeters long. Please note that this drawing is not to scale.

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:22.076
However, in the manufacturing process things aren't perfect. To acknowledge

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:26.613
that, Grant has created a tolerance range that wiper length is allowed to meet.

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:31.133
As long as the wiper is within 3 millimeters of this total length, either 3

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:36.165
millimeters longer or 3 millimeters shorter, then it's acceptable and can be put

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:40.743
on the market. Let's call the blade length in centimeters of a given wiper x.

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:45.532
What we're really concerned with then, is the difference between x, the blade

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:50.217
length, and 2.5 centimeters, the target blade length. If x is longer than 2.5

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:54.832
centimeters, then you want the difference between x and 2.5 centimeters to be

00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:59.255
less than or equal to 0.3 centimeters, which is the same as 3 millimeters.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:04.096
However if x is shorter than 2.5 centimeters, then you want the difference

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:09.049
between x and 2.5 to be greater than or equal to negative 0.3. Since x could be

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.933
something like 2.4, if it's shorter, and 2.4 minus 2.5 is negative 0.1, which is

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:18.579
greater than or equal to negative point 3. Taking into account all the possible

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.986
values of x, we want both of these things to be true. So, we need to insert an

00:01:22.986 --> 00:01:28.252
and between these two values. If we were to show this range of values for x

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:34.140
minus 2.5 on a number line, you would get this. The region is, just like shown

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.758
in our inequalities, symmetric about zero.
