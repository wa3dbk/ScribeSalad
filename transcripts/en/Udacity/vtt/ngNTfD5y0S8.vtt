00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.360
Graphic elements of your user interface
can change appearance to reflect

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.360
the different states they're in.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.730
For example, they may change appearance
to show that they are checked, or

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.430
pressed, or focused, or
even some combination of that,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.390
such as both checked and pressed.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.410
If you were making a web app you
would define these states in CSS, but

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.090
in Android we use state lists.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.610
States lists are XML files that

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.990
list the assets to use given
a particular state of a UI element.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.920
You just give it a range
of resources for

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.560
the different states and
everything is taken care of for you.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.140
So here's a state list for
check boxes drawable.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.640
It uses different images for
each of the defined states.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.660
When the check box is just checked,
it uses this image.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.141
When it's just pressed and

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:52.490
not checked it uses this one and
if it's both checked and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.830
your finger is pressed down on the check
box, it should use this image.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.320
And by default, and in this case
where there are no special states,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.710
it just uses this default version.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.350
When using a stateless drawable for a UI
element, Android traverses the selector

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.090
and looks for the first item that meets
the minimum criteria for the state.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.920
So if you want to use an image to
represent multiple states, such as this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.990
one, pressed and checked, that should
be above the more general ones.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.210
Now, the interesting thing about states
is that you can even create your own.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.800
While there's things like pressed and
checked, and focused and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.180
selected and activated, and really
a lot of different types of states,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.980
you can even create
your own states to map

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.620
to whatever your application needs
to represent in its UI elements.
