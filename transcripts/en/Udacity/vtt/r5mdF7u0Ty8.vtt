00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.940
Now that you watched this small video, I like

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.660
to ask you, what is this? Do you think

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.330
it's fireworks for the 4th of July celebration, or

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.280
maybe it was a flare gun in action, or

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.240
maybe again it was the explosion of the Ariane

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.280
five rocket due to a software error. What do

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.190
you think? And in case it helps, I'm also

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.450
going to show you an actual picture of this event.
