00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.920
This hyperbola was centered at 4,2, has an a value of 2, and a b value of 4.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.826
Nice thinking if you got these correct. Now, the key is that y squared comes

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:19.064
first, so this means our hyperbola will open up and down. Remember, too, that k

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:25.260
is this value, and h is this value. H is always with x, and k is always with y.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.600
So, our center is really at positive 4 and positive 2. We take the opposite

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.940
signs of the terms in the parentheses. To get the value of a, we just take the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.650
square root of 4, since it's underneath the x squared term. The square foot of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.307
4 equals 2. And to get the value of b, we take the square root of 16, which

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:50.430
equals 4. We start by graphing the ellipse. The ellipse is centered at 4, 2.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.988
So, we go 4 units right, and 2 units up vertically. Now we need to go a and b,

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:59.960
we need to find the four other points on the ellipse. From the center we move 2

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.251
units in the x direction, and we move 4 units in the y direction. 2 is for a,

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:10.549
and 4 is for b. Remember that a is always associated with the x squared term,

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.070
this square root of 4 here. And b is always associated with the y squared term.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.266
In this case, the square root of 16. Now, we're ready to draw in our dash

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:25.458
rectangle and the two diagonals, so we can draw our hyperbola. We need to keep

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:29.230
in mind that our ellipse is going to open up and down, since y comes first.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.362
It's the positive term. So, we're going to cut our ellipse and them flip these

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:38.403
two ends outward. When we do that, we get our entire hyperbola. Now, let's make

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:43.247
sure this whole picture makes sense. Our hyperbola is centered at 4,2 and then

00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:49.829
we moved 2 units horizontally for our rectangle, an 4 units vertically.
