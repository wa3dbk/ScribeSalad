00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.228
Here are the sections of the domain that correspond to our different parts of

00:00:03.228 --> 00:00:07.417
our piecewise function. Note that each of these domains directly corresponds to

00:00:07.417 --> 00:00:11.740
the income ranges that went along with the different tax brackets. Just like we

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.990
saw on the chart earlier on. For the first piece of the function, we have zero

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.225
is less than or equal to X is less than 5000. Then we switch to this new

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:24.730
equation whose domain is 5,000 is less than or equal to X is less than 15,000.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.910
The part of the domain for the next piece of the function is 15,000 is less

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.460
than or equal to X is less than 35,000. And finally the highest tax bracket we

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.465
have listed here is for all values of X greater than or equal to 35,000.
