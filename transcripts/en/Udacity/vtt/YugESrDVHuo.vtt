00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.680
Basic traffic metrics, such as
unique visitors, overall pageviews,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.260
session length and interval,
and traffic sources,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.720
can help you establish a good baseline
on how a site or an app is doing.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.720
But you'll want other metrics
to help you monitor the quality

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.660
of the user experience.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.490
The HEART framework can
help you define UX metrics

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.540
that are relevant to your product.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.120
HEART is an acronym that stands for
five broad categories.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.860
First is happiness.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.930
These metrics are often captured through
surveys, and measure user attitudes for

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.680
things like satisfaction, perceived
ease of use, and net promoter score.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.860
Engagement is the second category.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.890
These metrics monitor user behavior,
perhaps frequency, intensity, and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.060
depth over some period of time.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.610
For example, Udacity might be interested
in the number of videos watched

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.740
per user, per day.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.170
Instagram, on the other hand,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.680
might measure the number of photos
uploaded per user, per week.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.400
These types of metrics will
really depend on the types of

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.900
activities that your users will do.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.310
The next category is Adoption.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.550
You can track the number of new users
who use a product or potential feature.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.720
For instance, you might track the number
of new accounts created each week, or

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.250
daily usage of a feature such
as bookmarking in a browser.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.770
The R is for Retention.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.310
You learned about Retention all ready,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.680
which let's you track active users from
some starting time to some ending time.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.840
Finally, the last
category is task success.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.140
These types of metrics are related
to traditional behavior metrics,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.040
such as efficiency,
time to complete a task, effectiveness,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.820
which is percent of completed tasks,
and error rate.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.260
Now, you don't need to have metrics for
all of these categories.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.020
Instead, you should think
about which categories and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.330
their associated metrics would be most
important for the entire product.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.370
You also might think about which
metrics would be important for

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.030
specific features of a product.
