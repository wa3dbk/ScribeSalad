00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.910
Cookie is a small piece of data stored in

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.640
the browser for a website. And by small, I

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.970
mean less than four kilobytes. And in practice, we're

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.830
only talking about 100 bytes, just a small you know,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.500
really just a string. It takes the format conceptually

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.660
is something like this, name equals value. And in practice

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.360
it may look something like this, user.id equals 12345.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.190
Cookies are really commonly used for things like user IDs

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.540
and, and you know, kind of temporary information that, that a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.566
browser wants to store, you know, whether you're logged into a website.

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.240
You know, generally, you, you have a cookie that represents the, the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.270
fact that you're logged in as user, you know, 12345. So to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.900
kind of draw you a little picture of how these things

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.460
fit together, you know, we might have your browser, and it makes

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.920
requests, you know, to some web servers. And a web server might

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.220
send back, in it's response, some cookie data, and this is in

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.530
the form of an HTTP header. And then your browser

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.580
basically just stores this cookie, it's associated with this website.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.900
We'll talk more about that shortly. And then every time

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.462
your browser makes a request to this website in the

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:06.024
future, now that it has this cookie, it will, it

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.218
will send the cookie back to the server. So, you

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:11.944
know, if you are logging in, you might, you might

00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:14.844
post some form here and the server might respond with okay,

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:18.680
welcome to our website you are user 12345. And then on

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.620
every future request, you say, hey, I'm user 12345. And that's

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.450
how the website knows that you're logged in. And a cookie,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.400
you know, is, is just basically a file that your browser stores.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.360
Generally, you can store about, about 20 cookies per website. Now,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.723
this is basically up to the browser. It's some sort of,

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:37.490
it, it, it's a browser limitation. Another limitation is probably the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.430
length of the cookie, which we said is less than four k,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.660
but in reality [LAUGH], you know, this is this is

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.030
five bytes. And we're probably, you know, most of the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.560
cookies we're storing are not, you know, thousands of bytes.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.630
Another limitation is a cookie has to be associated with a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.536
particular domain. So, you know, a cook, a cookie for

00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:59.745
udacity.com is only sent to you to udacity.com and, and udacity.com

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:03.340
can only set cookies for udacity.com. So, it's, each website

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.590
has you know, a few cookies that it can store that

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.080
are private for that website. A lot of this depends

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.609
on the browser to behave properly. So, you know, this

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.550
20 cookies per website that's an old Internet Explorer limitation.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.590
Honestly I don't know what the limit is for modern browsers.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.590
But if you're storing more than 20 cookies on, on

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.050
a particular domain, you'll probably rethink things a little bit.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.810
You know, maybe store more data in, you know, in

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.690
a, a single cookie. The four kilobytes, again, there, there's so

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.570
many things that can go wrong when you start sending big

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.260
cookies that are, you know, 4000 bytes long. You know, you can

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.965
set, some, some browsers don't handle

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:39.230
multi-line cookies properly. Some web servers

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.910
don't handle multi, multi-line cookies properly, so I would suggest keeping it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.210
short and simple. And, and most of our use cases are for

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.790
storing small pieces of data that you don't want to store in a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.630
database. It's easier to just store them in a cookie. Or, you

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.810
know, small pieces of, you know, temporary data that is, that is

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.010
only relevant to this particular user in this particular browser right

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.670
now. Now this, this constraint, you know, a cookie being associated

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.120
with pick your website is, is important. It prevents you know,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.300
me from, you know, the, the cookie is, is, is what makes

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.110
me be logged in at a lot of websites, so. If

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.420
another website could forge this cookie or read this cookie, you know,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.672
they could pretend to be me on another website. You know,

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:20.850
they could steal my log in information. So cookies, the, the domain

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.090
that cookie belongs to is, is really important. But it's up to the browser to

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.980
enforce those rules. And sometimes browsers have bugs

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.950
you know, none of the modern ones do.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.120
I can't remember the last time that happened.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.210
But you know, it's just something to be

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.820
aware of. These are, this is all kind

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.230
of browser side, you know, client side, enforced
