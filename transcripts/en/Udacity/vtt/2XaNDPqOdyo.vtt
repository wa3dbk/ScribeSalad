00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:05.976
In Problem Set #2 you will be implementing a parallel algorithm for blurring images.

00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:08.408
Here is an example of the effect we're talking about.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:16.575
Here's your original image and here's the image after we apply a blur effect to that original image.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:20.849
Blurring an image involves averaging a local neighborhood of pixels,

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.017
and it is expressed naturally using a parallel stencil operation.

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:31.123
Stencil operations come up all the time in all types of application domains.

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:35.268
This is why we are going to focus in on stencil in this homework.

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:42.332
Let's take a closer look at a simple example demonstrating the kind of local averaging that we are talking about here.

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:47.139
Suppose we have the following pixel representation of an image,

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:52.683
and we want to calculate the average intensity value for this pixel right here.

00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:54.027
What do we do?

00:00:54.027 --> 00:01:03.501
First we take the value of this pixel, and then we add this value to the value of all its neighbors.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:12.001
So 10 4 6 2 1 2 3 and 6, and once when we add up all these values then we take the average.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:20.046
Since we have 9 elements or 9 pixels here, then we multiply the sum by 1/9,

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:27.075
and that is how you would calculate the average intensity value for a pixel in an image.

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.477
If we do this operation for every pixel in the image,

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:34.454
we will arrive at a blurred version of input image.

00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:42.087
However it turns out that performing an unweighted average of pixels can sometimes look really ugly,

00:01:42.087 --> 00:01:47.761
and we can achieve a better looking blur by computing a weighted average of these pixels.

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:51.265
What I mean by weighted average is the following.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:59.685
Rather than multiplying 1/9 to each pixel value here, we will multiply each pixel value by a different weight.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:04.724
So w1 is different than w2. And w2 may be different than w3.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:07.265
And w3 may be different than w4.

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:12.032
And that is the approach that we will take in Problem Set #2.

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:15.402
Here is an image produced by weighted blur,

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:18.438
and here is an image produced by unweighted blur,

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:21.038
and as you can see that the weighted blur

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:26.178
is much smoother than the unweighted blur counterpart.

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:34.207
In this problem set we will give you a small 2D array that contains weight values between 0 and 1 as follows.

00:02:34.207 --> 00:02:36.053
But this is just an example.

00:02:36.053 --> 00:02:40.568
The actual weight values that we will use will look like this:

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:45.213
the smooth shape of the weights, as you can see here,

00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:49.116
will produce the nice looking blur effect that we saw earlier.

00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:51.245
And also, here's a note.

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:56.012
We will blur color images by blurring each color channel independently,

00:02:56.012 --> 00:03:04.380
and we will include a more detailed mathematical formula on blurring computations in the instructor comments.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.056
This is what you need to do for Problem Set #2.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:11.460
First, you will need to write the actual blur kernel.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.700
Second, you will need to actually write the kernel that separates the color image to its R, G, B channels.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.880
And third we will give you the opportunity to allocate memory on the device for the filter,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.610
so you will have an opportunity to code CUDA mem copies.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.961
And fourth, you will have to set the correct or the optimal grid and block size for this problem set.

00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.832
And, as you remember in Problem Set #1,

00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:48.394
the grid and the block size has a huge impact on your program's execution time.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:52.968
Set the size correctly and be careful.

00:03:52.968 --> 00:03:58.675
Lastly your submission will be evaluated based on correctness and speed.

00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:03.012
But we recommend that you focus on correctness first.

00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:09.718
Then after your blurring kernal is run correctly then we recommend that you try to make it run faster.

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:17.232
And lastly we have supplied serial code that you can reference and compare your solution against.

00:04:17.232 --> 00:04:19.983
Good luck on writing Problem Set #2.

00:04:19.983 --> 00:04:23.983
