00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
In the previous unit, we have introduced the notion of NP completeness

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.390
and seen that a myriad of practically relevant problem is NP complete.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.020
So, we think there is no polynomial time algorithm for these problems.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.140
Now, the question last time we left off was what does this mean

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.690
for Alice, Bob, and Carol--the three computer scientists we were following?

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.130
Should they just give up?

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.340
Should they ask for a new problem?

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.980
And I think that is something they might do,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.710
arguing that the problems are NP-complete,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.259
but actually they could do much better,

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.800
using some of the techniques that you are about to learn in this unit and the following units.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.750
Because what we will now be investigating is techniques to actually solve problems

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.230
despite their NP-completeness.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.380
Now, this will not always work,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.930
but it will be much better than just giving up,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.820
because there are so many NP-complete problems out there

00:00:52.820 --> 99:59:59.000
that are just too practically relevant to leave them alone.
