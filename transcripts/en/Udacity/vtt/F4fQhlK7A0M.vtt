00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.420
At this point, we are done writing our super class in the pseudo classical

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.550
pattern, and instances of car should work as expected.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.220
But now, we need to move on to making our sub classes work.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.750
We start by writing a constructor function for the van sub class.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.560
So here we are building up a new subclass in memory.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.460
And that subclass is supposed to derive a lot of its behavior from

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.140
the superclass Car.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.920
What code do you think we should put insider the Van function?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.780
Give it a shot. Hint: it's going to involve the loc input variable.
