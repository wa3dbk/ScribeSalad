00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.370
For this programming assignment you needed to create the

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.060
variable all purchases and add it to our Yo data

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.420
frame. The transform function takes in a data frame and

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.200
allows us to add different variables to it by recombining

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.750
variables that are already within the data frame. So

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.570
here I'll create the variable All Purchases and then I'll

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.320
set it equal to the sum of all the yogurt

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.350
flavors strawberry, blueberry, pina colda, plain, and mixed berry. When

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.720
I run the code, I can see that my number of variables

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.620
changed. And, just to be sure, I can print a summary of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.270
this variable as well. You might have also used this code. This

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.090
code is fine, it's just a bit more verbose than we need.
