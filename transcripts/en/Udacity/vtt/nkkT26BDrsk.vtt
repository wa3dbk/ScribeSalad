00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.569
This pseudo quadratic equation can be written as the quantity x squared squared

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.333
minus 13 times x squared plus 36. It turns out that the repeated expression is

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:16.277
x squared. We'll use that here, and we'll use that here. We know this since x

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:20.385
squared to the 1st power is just x squared. And x squared to the 2nd power is x

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:24.940
to the 4th. Nice thinking if you found these two expressions.
