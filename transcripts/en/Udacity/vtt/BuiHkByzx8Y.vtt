00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.120
For the grand finale,
we finally come to closures.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.820
Closures are similar to blocks in
Objective C, or lambdas as in Python,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.140
Java and Ruby.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.210
Closures, like functions,
are self-contained blocks of code.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.750
So what's the difference between
a closure and a function?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.390
Well, global functions and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.540
nested functions, which we didn't
have a chance to talk about, but

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.140
if you're curious, follow the link
in the instructor's notes.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.490
Anyway, global functions and
nested functions are closures.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.860
But most of the time when a person
refers to a closure in Swift,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.360
they're referring to
a closure expression.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.750
In this lesson, we'll be
focusing on closure expressions.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.100
So what's a closure expression?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.770
A closure expression is an unnamed
self-contained block of code

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.960
that can be passed as
an argument to a function.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.550
Closure expressions are unique
in that they're unnamed.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.200
Okay, but
what are closure expressions good for?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.660
Well, this ability to pass
a block of code to a function

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.080
makes it easy to specify an action to
be executed sometime in the future.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.450
Let's look at a couple examples.
