00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.150
Let's repeat this exercise, but this time using discrimination tree for

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.350
organizing the case memory. So here is a discrimination tree,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.110
containing the cases currently in the case memory. And here is the,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.620
new problem. You could go to the initial location, to the goal location.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.830
Given this problem, what case would be retrieved from this discrimination tree?
