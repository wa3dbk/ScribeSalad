Lastly, this problem will be a bit more challenging than the others we've done

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:08.210
today. As we're going to use the intermediate value theorem to approximate the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.173
zeros of the following function. Please note that we are calling the

00:00:13.173 --> 00:00:20.260
independent variable here p instead of x. Remember that we can use any letters

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.836
we want.
