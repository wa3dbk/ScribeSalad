00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.320
So the whole idea of security
planning and security management

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.170
is to be better prepared when
it comes to cyber security.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.900
So, if your enterprise, your company,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.053
if your ask how well prepared you are,
how good is the state of cyber security?

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:18.890
Really, that's what the cyber
security posture is.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.389
So, cyber security posture,how do we
address our security, how do we prepare

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:27.910
ourselves for cyber security, how do
we handle when something goes wrong.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.870
The posture can either be reactive,
unfortunately,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.760
in many cases, this is what it is.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.160
What does reactive mean?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.020
Well, we worry about it,
because we're sort of forced to do it.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.790
Because there's a regulation compliance
requirements they say you must do so.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.110
And we react to that regulation
that comes down our throats.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.660
All it's customer's demands,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.365
customer's saying I will not do
business with you unless you have that.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:58.175
Lot of companies these days,
especially business to business,

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:02.515
b to b, they don't want to business
with someone who has lax cyber security.

00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:03.715
So again,

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:08.320
we react to this demand that comes from
somebody we want to do business with.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.430
It could be in response to something
bad that happens to us, okay.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.100
So breach for example, the target, Home
Depot examples, everybody talks about.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.170
So, we react to the adverse
event that we suffered, so

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.750
that's another example of what
reactive security posture is.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.860
And, finally, it may be in
response to events that occur,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.120
our competition may have suffered.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.440
One bank, for example,
suffers a bridge and

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.420
other banks may react to
that by making sure that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.800
the vulnerabilities that were exploited
don't exist in their IT systems.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.643
So all these are examples of, so
this is a reactive posture, I said,

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:54.210
unfortunately security is event driven
when something something bad happens.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.380
People say, we need it and so
we need to do something about.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.990
But this is what is called a reactive
posture to cyber security.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.630
Of course,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.730
it's better to have what is called
a pro active approach to security.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.169
You plan for it, that's what
security planning is talking about.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.930
You work hard to assess your risk, you
do things to reduce it, look at the cost

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.290
and do that before either you're
forced because of regulation or

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.070
forced because something bad happens to
you and you respond to it reactively.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.620
So what are some examples of proactive
things that companies should be doing?

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.770
Well first of all, it should be
somebody's job to worry about cyber

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.300
securities and assets,
how they protect it,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.200
how people are educated, cyber security
insurance, having a good policy.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.930
Making sure people are held responsible
and empowered to do things, and all

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.260
the things we talked about when it comes
to security planning and management.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.120
So having a champion whose
job it is to worry about it,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.098
a champion should have influence.

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:55.650
If is doesn't, he or
she doesn't have influence of

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.130
course you're not going to
get anything meaningful done.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.650
So one thing people talk about,
for example, is well,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.140
is this proactively addressed at
the highest level in an organization?

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.530
Talk about the board level conversation.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.980
The board addresses various kind of
risks an enterprise has to deal with.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.620
Is cyber security risk one of those,
or is there a conversation about it?

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.110
Is there a conversation about what
needs to be done to reduce that risk?

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.830
Is there an investment made in cyber
security controlled in solutions and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.360
personnel and things like that?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.000
If that's done before bad things happen,
that would be a proactive approach.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.770
It's again unfortunately not aware
this is happening in every company.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.400
In fact, one of the things that
happened we said target hired a CSO,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.280
who does the CSO report to?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.920
Does the CSO report to CIO?

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.840
Well when it's not talking about
the highest level it doesn't

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.370
report to the CEO.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.890
The CEO maybe doesn't bring it up at
the board level and things like that.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.460
So proactive means somebody,
the champion, looks ahead,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.490
has the influence that's necessary and
has support at the highest levels and

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.740
that would be a proactive posture for
cyber security.
