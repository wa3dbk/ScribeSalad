00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.810
So again, the correct response for
this query is to take the mean of the K,

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.550
where K is equal to 3,
nearest neighbors.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.070
Take the mean of their Y-value,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.890
and that gives us a value
somewhere about like there.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.010
If we were to repeat
this process at many,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.830
many points along the X-axis, we end
up with a model that looks like this.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.730
What's nice about it is it fits the data
over here where it's curving this way.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480
It fits the data over here
where it's curving that way.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.500
And in interpolates nicely and
smoothly between all the data points.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.530
There are number of methods like
this that keep the data around and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.110
when they make a query, they consult
the data to find the answer.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.560
The most famous of these
methods is K nearest neighbor.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.590
But there are others,
such as kernel regression.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.789
The main way that KNN differs
from kernel regression is that in

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.474
kernel regression we weight
the contributions of each of the nearest

00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:05.349
data points according to
how distant they are.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.461
Where as with KNN,

00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:11.010
each data point that we consider
gets essentially an equal weight.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.750
We've covered now parametric models,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.920
where our goal is to find
parameters like M and B.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.820
And we toss the data away, and
then just use M and B later to make

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.570
our queries and here I've shown
you non-parametric or instance

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.480
based methods where we keep the data and
we consult it when we make a query.
