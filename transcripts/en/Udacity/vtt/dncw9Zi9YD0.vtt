00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.730
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.843
&gt;&gt; So what I did,
is I looked across the rows and

00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:07.310
tried to see which features
all three birds had in common.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.410
They all lay eggs, so
I'm going to figure that birds law eggs.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.580
They all have wings, so I' going to
figure that birds have wings.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.835
And none of them have fur, so

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.805
I'm going to figure that
birds don't have fur.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:19.555
Whether or
not they have talons can actually vary.

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:22.185
So the eagle and bluebird have
talons but the penguin does not.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.135
And whether or
not they are large can vary.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.945
The eagle and penguin are large,
but the bluebird's not.

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:29.230
So those things don't necessarily
define what a bird is.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.860
But these three things
seem to me like they do.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.270
&gt;&gt; That's a good answer, David.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.580
But I should quickly note that
this idea that we can decide on

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.440
the features that should go into
a super class, given the features

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.800
that are shared among these subclasses,
works only for certain kind of concept.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.780
It doesn't work for all concepts.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.850
Particularly, it work for

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.860
concepts that have a formal nature,
as we will see in just a minute.
