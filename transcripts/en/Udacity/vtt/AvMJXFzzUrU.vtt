00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.970
So let's take a step back for
moment, and

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.870
think about all that we've done
over the course of this lesson.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.080
So first, we became familiar
with the existing code base.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.300
And then we tied in tents
to each of our buttons.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.010
So we could move between
activities in our app.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.049
And lastly, we learned about
interfaces and on click listeners.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.560
Now remember each of these skills can be
used for apps beyond the new walk app.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.990
And I'd like you to take a moment
to reflect on these concepts and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.530
how you might use them
in your future projects.
