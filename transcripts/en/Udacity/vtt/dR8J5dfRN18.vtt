00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.480
I've already introduced you to shared memory synchronization.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.140
Lock is a primitive and particularly the mutual exclusion

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.650
lock is a primitive that is used ubiquitously

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.010
in writing shared memory parallel programs to protect data

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.070
structure so that one thread can exclusively modify

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.430
the data and release the lock so that another

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.380
thread can inspect the data later on and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.610
so on. And similarly, barrier synchronization is another synchronization

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.590
primitive that is very popular in scientific programs and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.720
we have covered both of these in fairly great detail

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.940
in talking about what the operating system has to

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.860
do in order to have efficient implementation of locks as

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.550
well as barriers. Now the up shot is, if

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.000
you are writing a shared memory program, there are two

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.280
types of memory accesses that are going to happen.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.000
One type of memory access is the normal reads and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.490
writes to shared data that is being manipulated

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.710
by a particular thread. The second kind of

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.780
memory access is going to be for synchronization

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.489
variables that are used in implementing locks and barriers

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.810
by the operating system itself. It may be

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750
the operating system, or it could be a user

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.100
level threads library that is providing these mutual

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.175
exclusion locks, or barrier primitives, but in implementing those

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:21.980
synchronization primitives, those algorithms are going to use reads and writes

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.900
to shared memory. So there are two types of shared memory accesses

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.010
going on in the execution of a parallel program. One is access

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.650
to normal shared data and the other is access to synchronization variables.
