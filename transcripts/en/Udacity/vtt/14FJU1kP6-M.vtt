00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.760
Now that you have been introduced to data types.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.600
Let's look at the many options of visual encodings that we have.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.000
Simply put, visual encodings are mapping from data to display elements.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.300
The visualization that we saw before shares the correlation between income per

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.900
person and life expectancy, in many different countries.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.310
This graphic is rich with visual encodings.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.420
Let's take a look at some of those visual encodings now.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.180
Life expectancy is encoded visually along the y axis,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.070
while spending per person is encoded along the x axis.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.500
For our data visualization this means that countries that are located in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.940
the top-right corner of the graph, like Qatar, had a high income per person and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.540
high life expectancy, the opposite would be true for

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.150
the countries in the lower left of the graph.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.520
Position is considered a planar variable because it locates points in space.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.570
It's probably one of the most prominent visual encodings that you'll see in

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.160
data visualization.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.319
And it's also a display element that we can perceive with great accuracy.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.850
So we know that position can be good for encoding two variables, but what do we

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.560
do if we want to visualize higher dimensions of the data, say a third variable.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.490
Well, we could visualize a third variable in the third dimension, so

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.680
along the z axis here.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.530
However, 3D models are generally poorly perceived by our eyes,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.590
as it's more difficult to make quantitative comparisons between points.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.010
For example, I'm not so

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.690
sure which of these two points has a greater y value, or height.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.310
So we need some other way of encoding some third variable for

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.140
our data visualization,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.990
fortunately, we have some other display elements that we can use instead.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.150
We can use what are called retinal variables to encode additional variables for

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.720
our data set, size is an example of a retinal variable, and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.490
it's particularly good for ordered data.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.200
Going back to our world health data visualization,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.980
we can see that population is encoded by the size of each of the circles, or

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.650
more precisely by the area of each point.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.750
In combination with color, the size attribute makes some

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.680
countries more recognizable such as India, China and the United States.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.210
Size and color hue,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.480
which we just saw in the visualization, are both examples of retinal variables.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.470
And if we wanted to,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.280
we can even encode additional variables and these other retinal variables.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.670
Size, orientation, and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.960
color saturation are particularly effective for order data.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.040
However, it maybe difficult to perceive quantitative differences using these

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.940
visual encodings.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.740
The perceived value difference between say light blue and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.030
light light blue isn't so obvious.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.520
These other retinal variables such as color hue, shape, and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.360
texture, are great for encoding nominal variables.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.260
For our gap minder visualization,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.759
we can see that color hue encodes the geographical regions of the world.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.640
This choice of color makes it easier to compare income and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.830
life expectancy across developed and less developed countries of the world.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.290
The last variable we need to address is time.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.850
Now, time isn't a static display element like color, size or position.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.900
Instead time is animated through individual frames in our visualization.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.520
The quick succession of these frames shows change in life expectancy,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.720
income per person, and population over time.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.640
It is the remarkable and engaging aspect of this visualization, and we

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.790
will learn how to incorporate this type of dynamic visualization in lesson four.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.083
Now that you've seen one example of how map data to display elements,

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:49.880
we`re going to see if you can do it for two more visualizations.
