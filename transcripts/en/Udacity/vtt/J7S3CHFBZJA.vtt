00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.500
Let's talk about a smarter approach.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.345
Our first goal doesn't need
to be maximize the value for

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:09.422
the largest weight possible.

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:13.905
What if we tried to maximize the value
for the smallest weights possible,

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:17.823
then kept adding them together
until we had our maximum weight.

00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:20.120
Let's look at an example.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.260
We start by creating an array, which
we'll use to store the maximum possible

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.100
value for
every weight up into our weight limit.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.470
We assume that the weights
are all positive integers, so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.890
the indices in the array
represent those weights.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.600
We initialize everything to zero for
now.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.960
These are objects that we're trying to
fit in a knapsack with a weight limit

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.600
of six.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.790
We take out the object
with the weight of two.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.810
We can update the value at index
two to the value of the object,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.180
then we'll update everything after
it as well with the same value.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.390
Even if our knapsack can hold six,
we've only seen one object so

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.550
far, so we need to base that
best value off one object.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.660
We look at the next object.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.585
Again we can't change
anything until index five.

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:14.934
The value of this object
is bigger than the max and

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:17.150
it takes up the whole weight.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.995
So we replace the max value for
weights five and six.

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:26.750
For the last object, the first thing
we could possibly change is index four.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.235
This value is less than that one so
we leave it alone.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.890
We look at index five and compare it to
our value plus the value at index one.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.288
Since the old value is larger,
we leave it as is.

00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:45.540
At index six we add our object
value to the value at index

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.480
two and end up with a bigger value,
so we replace it.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.620
And we've solved the problem.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.700
This may seem unnecessary with
an example this small, but

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.910
imagine how much time we'll
save with lots of objects.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.500
Here, we're taking advantage
of the table to store

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.360
precomputed maximum values.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.449
So we only need to do the work
once to get those numbers.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.220
We go through every object and check
if it can increase the maximum value of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.880
every possible weight up
to our maximum weight.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.650
Thus, the runtime is n times W,
where W is

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.919
the weight limit of our knapsack and
n is the number of elements.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.640
This is a pseudo
polynomial time solution.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.459
A true polynomial runtime wouldn't
have a variable besides n.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.120
I reiterate, polynomial time
algorithms are much faster than

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.140
exponential time algorithms for
big numbers.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.339
So the solution here
is generally faster.
