00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.730
We've covered how to
send screen view hits and

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.620
event hits from Tag Manager
to Google Analytics.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.359
But as you learned previously, there are
other kinds of hits that you can send.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.971
These include e-commerce,
timing, and exception hits.

00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:17.741
Now that you understand how to use
variables, triggers, and tags,

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:21.771
you should be able to apply those same
principles to sending other kinds of

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:22.690
tracking hits.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.253
You can find resources to
help in the instructor notes.

00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:30.294
You can also register functions that
get invoked by Tag Manager triggers.

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:32.860
Take a look at the documentation
to learn more about that.
