00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.043
If you got any of these correct, great work. We can use our area model to figure

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:09.971
out the product of these two binomials. We know x time x is x squared, x times

00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:14.930
negative 4 is negative 4x. Positive 4 times x is positive 4x, and positive 4

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.919
times negative 4 is negative 16. We use a similar approach to figure out this

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.438
multiplication problem and this one.
