00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.960
Most of you have probably seen
switch statements before.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.010
They're used in Java,
C based languages, Ruby.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.820
But they are arguably less
intuitive than if else statements.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.830
You'll be seeing a lot of
them in Swift though, and

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.570
hopefully come to appreciate
their conciseness.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.210
Switch statements are great when you're
trying to assess multiple conditions.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.970
Especially when you're conditioning on
multiple values of a given variable.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.860
Here's an example of
an if else statement,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.600
that might be better written
as a switch statement.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.440
It's a statement about the years
of the Chinese Zodiac.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.280
You can see that even though I'm
just looking at a few values that

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.320
match the years of the monkey and
the years of the goat,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340
my statement is already
getting a bit cumbersome.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.140
If we write this as a switch
statement it's easier to manage.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.170
Switch statements take the form switch,
then a type name, the type whose

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.680
value you're conditioning on, case,
the first value possible for this type,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.870
colon, then the statement that'll
be executed if this case is true.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.240
Note that you can combine two or

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.060
more values into the same case,
as in this third case.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.540
At the end of the statement
comes a default case.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.220
This last statement is executed if
none of the other cases are true.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.890
It's important to include this default
case, because a switch statement must

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.910
account for
every possible value of a given type.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.760
Every value must match
at least one case.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.060
So for our Chinese zodiac example,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.768
you can see that the statement switches
on the value of the variable birth year.

00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:24.140
If birth year has a value of 1992,
1980, or 1968,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.160
this print statement is executed.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.970
You were born in the year of the monkey.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.350
If birth year has a value of 1991,
1979, or 1967,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.680
the second print statement is executed.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.770
So let's change birth year to 1991.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.110
And we can see you were born
in the year of the goat.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.610
And if the value of birth year
doesn't match any of these six values,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.505
the default statement is executed.

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:56.045
So if this was 1993,
the default would be executed.

00:01:57.895 --> 00:01:59.845
Let's scroll down and
look at another example.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.100
Here's a program that
depicts the visible spectrum.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.570
It sets a variable, called color,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.970
based on the value of a variable
representing light wavelength.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.850
Here we can see the ellipsis again.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.610
Remember that in Swift this
is the range operator.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.350
So these values represent ranges
of wavelength within which

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.910
certain colors fall.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.630
If we alter the value of
the wavelength variable, we can see

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.690
different values being assigned to
the color variable in the sidebar.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.910
Notice that the value of wavelength
doesn't have to match the specified

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.600
range, it just has to fall within it.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.500
One aspect that distinguishes
switch statements in Swift,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.280
from switch statements in C for example,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.550
is that the flow of control does not
fall through from one case to the next.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.730
What do I mean by fall through?

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.890
Well, imagine moving through
the switch statement, and

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.070
checking each case in turn.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.670
What should happen when
a condition is met?

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.540
Should execution of the statement stop,
or

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.950
move on to evaluate
the rest of the cases?

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.430
To fall through is to continue
to evaluate the remaining cases.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.310
In Swift, if the conditions of one
case are met, the statement is done.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.180
Let's look a little closer at what
happens when switch statements don't

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.620
fall through.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.970
This example switch is on temperature.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.170
I live in California, so I'm pretty
much a wimp when it comes to the cold.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.130
Here you can see that 55 degrees appears
in both the first and the second case.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.820
So what will be the output?

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.210
When the temperature's 55
the console prints out brrr, and

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.700
then it's finished
evaluating the statement.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.510
It's done.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.800
The second case is never evaluated, the
console never prints out comfortable.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.170
Even though 55 does
match that second case.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.190
So what if I left a statement out?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.870
What would happen?

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.390
Let's find out.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.450
What if I left out this statement?

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.150
Okay, we get an error.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.150
What does it say?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.080
Case label in a switch should have
at least one executable statement.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.820
Every case needs an accompanying
statement, because with no fall through,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.700
if a case matches, the program needs
to be able to execute a statement and

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.200
then be done.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.700
That's all for now on control flow.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.490
Be sure to complete the exercises to get
lots of practice with for in loops and

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.690
switch statements.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.040
And stay tuned for
the next lesson on functions.
