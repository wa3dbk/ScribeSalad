00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.630
We'll use story understanding,

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.860
To examine the general
processes of understanding.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.660
Here are two stories that we
have encountered earlier.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.050
The first story is talking about the
earthquake that hit lower Slabovia and

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.890
caused some damage.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.650
The second story is talking about the
President of lower Slabovia who killed

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.470
a number of proposals.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.030
Both of them deal with killing.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.030
But the meaning of the two
stories are very, very different.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.630
Humans make use of stories to
understand the world around them.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.600
The world offers a very large
amount of data at any given time.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.030
We use the stories to provide
structure to that data,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.390
to make coherent sense of it.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.660
When we discuss these
two stories earlier,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.990
using frame as a knowledge
representation language,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.650
we found that we could have
a frame of this notion of killing,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.100
killing of 25 people, and this notion
of killing, killing of 25 proposals.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.960
And there was no simple way in
the frame knowledge representation

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.400
to disambiguate between those
two meanings of killing.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.140
Now we'll examine how we can construct
a different interpretation of

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
the first story, or
the interpretation of the second story,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.540
based on different interpretations of
the word killing in the two stories.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.550
In order to make the two
stories simpler, and

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.480
to illustrate our point, we're going to
focus on one sentence from each story,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.030
sentences that contain the word kill.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.360
Humans that have lived
through difficulty and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.410
understanding the first sentence means
completely different from the second

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.250
sentence because the killed in the first
sentence means something completely

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.230
different from the killed
in the second sentence.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.420
How can we build an err program
that can do the same thing?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.420
We will see that err program will need
to use a lot of background knowledge in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.890
order to be able to do that, and
that would generate hypotheses about

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.880
how humans might be using that
background knowledge to similarly

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.280
disambiguate between different
senses of the word killed.
