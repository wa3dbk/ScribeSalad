00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.927
If you said 1/12, nice work. This time,
I'm going to use some blocks to help me

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:07.684
out. This full block represents one candy
bar. I'm going to go ahead and section the

00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:12.287
candy bar into fourths. Okay, I have 1/4,
1/4, 1/4, and 1/4, all the fourths added

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.563
together make up my whole candy bar. I
have 1/4 of my candy bar here, but now I

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:21.318
need 1/3 of it. I'm going to split this
1/4 into 1/3. So, this piece right here

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:25.847
represents 1/3 of 1/4 of my candy bar.
Let's see how it compares to the original

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.095
whole candy bar. I can see that the one
piece is one out of the 12 pieces of my

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:34.690
candy bar, so 1/3 of 1/4 must be 1/12. And
you probably did it really easily. You

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:38.782
probably just said 1/3 times 1/4.
Remember, when we multiply fractions, we

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:41.930
multiply the numerators straight across,
and the denominators straight across. So,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.220
I have 1 times 1 and 3 times 4, or 1/12. This piece is
1/12 of my original candy bar.
