The solution to the system is 3, 2. We want to start by solving for one of the

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:09.141
variables and one of the equations. I think it's easiest to solve for y in this

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:13.773
equation. You can also solve for x or y in this equation and still wind up with

00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:18.396
the same result. I can take the equation, subtract 3x from both sides, to get

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:23.080
negative y equals negative 3x plus 7. Remember these are not like terms, so I

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.547
just list them. Now I need the positive y value, so I divide every term by

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:32.473
negative 1. We could also think about multiplying every term by negative 1, so y

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:37.185
equals 3x minus 7. Now we can perform substitution, we can take 3x minus 7 and

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:42.799
substitute it in for y. Since that's what it equals. Here I've replaced y with

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:48.532
3x minus 7, then I distribute the 2, distributing the 2, I get 2x plus 6x minus

00:00:48.532 --> 00:00:54.264
14 equals 10. I combine my terms so 8x minus 14 equals 10. Then I add 14 to both

00:00:54.264 --> 00:01:00.006
sides, so 8x is 24 and finally we divide both sides by 8, so x is equal to 3. So

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:05.146
we found x, but remember we still need to find y. I can use this first equation

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:10.242
to find y, since it's already solved for. I replace x with the value of 3, so y

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:15.471
equals 3 times 3 minus 7, or 9 minus 7, which is 2. And remember, you can always

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:20.807
make sure that you're right. Check the answer 3, 2 by plugging it into both

00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:25.664
equations. Do you come out with true statements? If so, you did great.
