00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.910
So we know permissions are represented
as Rs, Ws and Xs, indicating read,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.600
write and execute.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.880
But when we changed the permissions of
some files earlier we used numbers.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.260
How did the digits we entered
translate to these values?

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.330
We can translate these
values as follows.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.540
Rs are equal to 4.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.040
W's are equal to two,
X's are equal to one and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.200
if we don't want any permissions,
that will be a zero.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.930
By adding the numbers together,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.970
we end up with a result identifying
the full set of permissions to apply.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.000
For example,
if we wanted to give read and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.890
execute permissions,
we'd have values of four and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.640
one, which when added together,
gives us a final value of five.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.030
To represent, read, and

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.530
execute permissions,
you would use the number five.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.360
But remember, permissions are done
in sets of three to identify what

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.110
permissions are set for the individual
user, the group, and everyone.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.209
Let's analyze our student's
.bashrc file once again.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.390
And convert its current
permissions into octal form.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.100
The current permissions for
this file are rw dash, r dash dash, and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.440
r dash dash, r is a 4 and write is 2.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.350
So the user value would be 6.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.620
For group, we just have an r.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.730
So the value is 4.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.700
And for everyone we have a value of 4.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.824
To represent this permission set in
octal form, we'd use the value 644.
