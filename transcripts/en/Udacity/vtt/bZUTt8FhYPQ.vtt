00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.188
The answer is more. As we calculated earlier, Grant would only have $10,300 if

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:11.317
interest is compounded just one time a year. Compounding interest in this way

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:17.000
actually gives Grant more money after a year than annual compounding would. I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.053
wonder how we could generalize about this.
