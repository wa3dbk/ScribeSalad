00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome to homework assignment #4 in CS373.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To remind you, we covered A-star and dynamic programming in class.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's start with an A-star question.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We learned in class that we can use heuristics,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and a heuristic is a admissible if the heuristic value is no larger

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
than the actual cost it takes to get to the goal.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In a maze, we know that the number of steps in the maze is a good heuristic,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
because obstacles will make the path only longer, not shorter.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Consider a maze of size 3 x 3 and say there's a single goal state,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the cost of moving is 1.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Is the function shown here admissible or not?

00:00:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please check one of the two radio buttons.
