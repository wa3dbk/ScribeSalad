00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.652
To get a perfect square on the left. We'll need to add the quantity b over 2

00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:09.522
squared to both sides of the equation. Here, our value of b is positive 6. We

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:14.541
take 6, and we divide it by 2 to get 3. And then finally, we square that

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:18.720
quantity to get 9. The amount we need to add to both sides of our equation.
