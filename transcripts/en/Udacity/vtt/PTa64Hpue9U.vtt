00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.540
So the iron law of performance can easily

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.080
be applied when we spend a constant number of

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.010
cycles for each instruction. But how about unequal

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.970
instruction execution times? Meaning we spend different numbers of

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.120
cycles for different instructions. So this is our

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.366
original item law of performance. The number of instructions

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.966
per program, times the number of cycles per instruction,

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.504
times the clock cycle time. If we have different

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:29.736
clock cycles per instruction, this part becomes a sum

00:00:29.736 --> 00:00:33.855
for all types of instructions. The instruction count of that

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:36.295
type that we have to execute times the cycles per

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:39.650
instruction for that type of instruction. Note that, in the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.530
original iron log performance, this was really how many

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.450
cycles we need to execute the program. This is how

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.556
many cycles we need for each type of instructions. All

00:00:48.556 --> 00:00:50.602
of them in a program, and the sum here is

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:53.280
simply summing up over all types of instructions.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.090
So this is still the number of cycles we

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.760
execute in a program. And we still have the

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.530
clock cycle time here. So the new CPU time

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.740
here is like this. So if we have

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.770
different CPI, meaning different cycles per instruction for different

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.435
types of instructions, then we need to do this,

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.220
and just multiply that with the clock cycle time.
