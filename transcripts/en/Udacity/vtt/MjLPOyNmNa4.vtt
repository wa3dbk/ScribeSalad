00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.070
Now let's see a two-way set associative cache in action.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.110
We will assume a 5-bit address space with a 2 byte

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.930
cache length. Notice that I've added a valid bit to

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.510
our cache here, so that we can tell whether data has

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.240
ever been loaded up to a line in the cache.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.100
Uninitialized caches are called coal. Let's say that 0 is the

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.250
first address. In most systems that's not allowed, but it's fine

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.400
for our example. The second bit here tells us the index

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.073
for the cache. So we'll need to put this

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:30.950
in the 0 set somewhere. We put it in here,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.560
flipping the recently used item to say 1, because

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.760
that would be our preferred place to write the next

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.960
cache line with index 0. Maybe after this, I

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.170
have an address that looks like this one. The index

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.270
here is 1, so we want to put it in this

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.320
group, and again I'll put it in the first line,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.590
setting the valid bit, writing the data, and marking

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.970
the least recently used bit. Our next address has

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.070
index 0, so it gets written there. Notice that

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.730
I chose this slot because the LRU had been one,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.730
and I flipped it back to zero because this

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.160
is now the least recently used item in this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.880
part of the cache. Next we have an address

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.390
with index 1. We checked the tag and we see

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.930
that it's a hit. Oh my goodness. Notice that this address is a hit, even

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.930
though we didn't read the exact same address

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.900
before. But we did read an address belonging

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.190
to the same cache block. Next, we have

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.720
another address with index 0. So, he comes

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.010
in here and evicting one of the previous

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.690
entries. This one, because of the LRU bit.
