Hey. Hey you, are you listening? Are you paying attention to this lesson or are

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.451
you off daydreaming or surfing the Internet? Well, I personally hope you're

00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:09.533
paying attention, because I'm about to tell you something really awesome about

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:14.454
consciousness, and a fundamental aspect of it. And that's attention. Attention

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:17.814
is our ability to focus on a specific aspect of our environment, and to be

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:22.470
conciously aware of this. Now, it's important to remember that this is a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.462
conscious effort to focus our attention. Psychologists focus on two main types

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:31.170
of attention, that's Selective attention and Sustained attention.
