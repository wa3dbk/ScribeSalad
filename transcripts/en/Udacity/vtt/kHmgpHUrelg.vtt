00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.460
Why do we need data standards?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.050
This simple illustration
helps to make that clear

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.640
using a seemingly obvious
data element: gender.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.010
It also helps explain
the difference between syntax,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.460
which is structure, and
semantics, which is meaning.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.980
Here, in system A, male is represented
by a one, and female by a zero.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.230
Over here in system B, that's reversed,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.910
with zero representing male and
one representing female.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.390
Should you mix data from these
two systems without some

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.010
intervening standard, gender would be
impossible to determine accurately for

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.457
reporting and other purposes.

00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:48.300
We say these two systems
differs syntactically.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.220
They maybe using the same
language of one's and zero's, but

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.542
they can't interoperate without some
intermediate translation process that

00:00:57.542 --> 00:01:01.800
maps one to the other, or
both to some common syntax.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.350
Over in system C, M is used for
male, and F for female.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.150
We say that system C differs
semantically from systems A and

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.630
B, it uses a different
language to represent gender.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.600
Moreover, system C recognizes
that gender may be ambiguous, and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.805
represent that with a U, a concept
the other two systems don't deal with.

00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:30.940
Interoperability between system C and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.800
the other two systems would require
translation from its syntax to theirs,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.840
or translations of both syntaxes
to a common form, a standard.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.570
Since patients with gender U can't
be represented in systems A and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.190
B, some accommodation for
that would also have to be made.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.300
If something as seemingly simple and

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.910
obvious as gender can lead
to this much complexity,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.870
imagine what happens with concepts such
as a patient's diagnosis, which is

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.740
inherently somewhat subjective and
can have thousands of possible values.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.788
That's why we need data standards.
