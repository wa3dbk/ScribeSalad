It's important to know that the field
has two main areas.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.360
There's the practice side,
and the research side.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.280
The practice side focuses
on applying the knowledge

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.500
we gain from research in everyday life.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.530
For example, diagnosing and treating
thought, and behavioral problems,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.900
or helping businesses
operate more effectively.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.510
Or even to get your children
to behave properly.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.370
The research side focuses
on furthering our knowledge

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.122
and understanding of how
people behave and think.
