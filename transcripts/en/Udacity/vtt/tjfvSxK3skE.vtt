00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is if we want an alternative of the patterns x and y,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
then we use a protocol. We say let's apply x to the set of numbers.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That gives us a set of strings that matches.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll just union that with the set that comes back from applying y to the set of numbers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, for one of char--this will be a list of possible characters that we're trying to match one of.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If 1 is in our list of numbers, then we should return all of those,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we have to return them as a set.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We'll say the set of character if 1 is in there.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Otherwise, there are no matches at all, so return null.
