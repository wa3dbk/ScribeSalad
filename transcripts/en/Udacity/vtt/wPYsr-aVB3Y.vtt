00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's go through it together, and this first one starts with a left angle bracket,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which looks super promising, but then it has this slash

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which we don't see reflected up here, so this one doesn't match,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
could not have produced this sequence of 5.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Over here we have a left angle bracket, a b, a right angle bracket.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Looking great. Salvador, looking good.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Dali, looking great. Oh, yeah, this totally matches.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Down here we have almost the same sentence, but there's no space

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
between salvador and dali.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is very close, but instead of getting 2 separate words at the end,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it would break down into just one word at the end, salvadordali,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so this one doesn't match.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Over here we start with a bold tag, have salvador and then dali,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but then we have a few more characters that aren't shown in this list of 5,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so this doesn't match exactly.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here we have salvador followed by the bold tag.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That's getting the order wrong, and the order of this breakdown is really going to matter.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We really need to know the order of words in a sentence.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Super important, it is.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Finally, over here we start with bold, and we have salvador dali again.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This looks great. No problems there.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Notice the spacing was a little different.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here we had a space between the bold tag and salvador.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Here we had kind of a space over here.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
These spaces don't matter very much.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Salvador Dali was a Spanish artist famous for his surrealist paintings,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
probably most famous for painting The Persistence of--

00:01:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I can't remember. Let's just go on.
