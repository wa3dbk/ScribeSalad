Alright, now you try one on your own. I want you to add these two rational

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:07.777
expressions together and remember to check to see if you can simplify your

00:00:07.777 --> 00:00:11.933
numerator and your denominator in the end. Make sure your numerator is

00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:16.551
multiplied out in the end, and make sure the denominator is in factored form.

00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:18.157
Have fun and good luck.
