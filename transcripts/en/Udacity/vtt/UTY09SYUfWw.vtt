00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.895
It's good enough to provide a single method present question whose parameter is

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:08.526
a question. A choice question is a special kind of a question, and so, you can

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:13.201
pass a choice question into a method that expects a question. In general,

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.674
anytime that you have a subclass, you can give it to any method that expects a

00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:23.133
super class object. Go ahead and try this out. Make a quiz that contains a

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:27.160
question and a choice question. Just reuse that question that we had before,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.240
that asks who was the inventor of Java. Over here, both of the questions are

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.794
paths to the single presentQuestion method. And in that method, just to make

00:00:36.794 --> 00:00:39.890
sure that you got the point, fill in the right type for the parameter.
