00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.940
Now that you have a sense of what a merging strategy could look like for

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.960
a simple file, let's take a look at how Git could use this type of

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.900
strategy to allow you to merge two branches together.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.480
Right now, I want to create a combined version of my coins branch and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.560
the master branch.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.300
If all Git had was these two commits, it wouldn't be able to tell how to merge

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.000
them together, just like you couldn't tell earlier whether Jake added a line or

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.440
whether Rachel deleted it.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.710
Luckily, Git also has a record of what the code looked like before the two

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.250
branches diverged.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.170
This is analogous to the file that Rachel and

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.300
Jake had at the beginning of the day.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.670
Using these three commits, Git can create a combined version of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.320
the two branches using a similar strategy to the one you used earlier.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.190
Commits are the basic building block of Git, so it probably isn't that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.260
surprising to you that this combined version will also be a commit.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.860
But what will be the parent of this new commit?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.360
As it turns out, when you use Git to create a merge commit, that commit

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.720
stores information about both of its parents, so I'll add arrows to both.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.290
Since the goal of this merge is to get the content from the coins branch

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.060
into the master branch, I'm going to want this new commit to be the new

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.350
tip of the master branch since the master branch is the one getting updated.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.090
Git practitioners will often refer to this process as merging the coin

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.880
branch into the master branch.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.810
After the merge, the master branch will include all the changes that had

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.550
before plus the changes from the coins branch.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.460
It's sort of like creating a new commit with all the changes from the coin

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.090
branch, except that I still have access to each of these old commits.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.550
Note that this is very different from what we would see if we took the state of

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.950
the files at this point, at the end of the coin branch, and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.130
made a commit with that on top of master.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.010
All that would do is basically set master to be the same state as coins, but

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.240
that's not what we want to do.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.400
We want to have all of these changes merged in as well.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.850
Once we've successfully merged the two branches,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.320
we won't need an easy reference to this commit anymore.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.470
We'll be able to reach it through the master.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.930
So once we're done with the merge, we can delete the coin branch.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.210
Note that when we talk about deleting branches, we mean deleting the label.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450
The commits will still be there in the history.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.940
However, if no branches can reach the commit,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.850
deleting a branch does effectively discard its commits.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.300
So if you deleted the coins branch without merging it in first, you would

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.260
essentially be abandoning these commits since they would all become unreachable.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.410
After you create the merge commit, which commits do you think would be included

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.960
if we ran git log on the master branch?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.080
For each of the commits with the checkbox next to it, check whether or

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.340
not you think it would be included.
