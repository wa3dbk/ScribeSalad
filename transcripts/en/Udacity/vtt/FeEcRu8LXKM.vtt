For these two functions, f of f inverse of x, just gives us x. And f inverse of

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.637
f of x also gives us x. Remember that when we create composite functions, what

00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:16.610
we're doing is taking the output of the function that's on the inside. And

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.570
using it as the input for the function that's on the outside. This seems pretty

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.862
uncanny that we end up with x for both of these compositions. Maybe we're on to

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:26.789
something here.
