00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.910
Sometimes it might not be clear to what exactly does this

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.390
particular verb correspond to. So consider,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.360
Susan comforted Jing. Well, what exactly did Susan do to comfort Jing?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.158
It's not at all clear. Not clear what the primitive action should be.

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:19.230
Although if you may not understand what exactly is the primitive action here.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.990
We want agents nevertheless to do common sense reasoning.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.380
Their interpretation might be incomplete, this interpretation might be partial.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.850
Nevertheless, you and I, as humans understand something about Susan and

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.560
Jing here, that Susan for example, did something that made Jing happier.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.546
We want the agent to do the same kind of reasoning, without knowing what exactly

00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:46.380
is the comforting action here. So we may have a generic primitive action of do.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.440
This generic primitive action will use it, whenever we are unable to decide,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.010
whenever the agent is unable to decide, what exactly is the primitive action

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.430
that should be pulled out. So the agent will simply say, well, Susan did

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.760
something that made Jing's mood happy and this is as much interpretation that

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.940
the agent might be able to the sentence, which is a pretty good interpretation.
