00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.588
The most basic parabola has the equation y equal x squared. Now, we can tell

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:09.548
that the center, or really the vertex of this parabola is at the origin, 0

00:00:09.548 --> 00:00:15.075
comma 0. The parabola opens in the upward direction, and it has an a value of

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:20.300
1. The a value is simply the number that's in front of the x squared term.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.610
Since it's not listed, we know that the coefficient is a 1. Another interesting

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.604
part about parabolas is that they're symmetric. If there's a point on the left

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:32.868
hand side of the graph, then there's another point equally distant away from

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:38.665
its axis of symmetry on the right hand side of the graph. For example, we have

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:42.889
the point negative 3, 9. Then, on the other side of the graph, we have the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:48.403
point 3 comma 9. We also have the point negative 2, 4. And on the right side of

00:00:48.403 --> 00:00:53.108
the graph, we also have the point 2 comma 4. Two units in the horizontal

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:57.520
direction right, and then four units vertically up. The lowest point, or the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.520
turning point for our parabola, is the vertex. It's at the origin, 0 comma 0.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.168
Now we could make an x and y table and create a table of values to get our

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:12.140
graph. But an easier way to get a couple points on the graph is to look at the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.406
a value. We're going to zoom in on this parabola. We can find the basic shape

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:22.838
of this parabola by looking at the a value. The points to the left and to the

00:01:22.838 --> 00:01:28.851
right of the vertex will be exactly 1 unit above the current point. So we move

00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:36.930
one unit left, and one unit up. We move one unit up since the a value is one.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.260
And then to get the symmetric point, we move in the opposite direction. One

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.648
unit right, and one unit up. So, we can see that we have a point of negative 1

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:52.000
comma 1, and a point of 1 comma 1. Let's make another graph and see some

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.702
comparisons. For the graph y equals 2x squared, we also get a parabola. This

00:01:57.702 --> 00:02:03.504
parabolas vertex is at the origin, its still 0 0. But what's different the a

00:02:03.504 --> 00:02:09.419
value. Now the a value is 2. So to get the basic shape of this graph, we'll

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:15.865
move 1 unit 3 and 1 unit left from the vertex. Then we'll go a units up in this

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:23.114
case 2 units. So 1 unit left and 2 units up. This gives us our first point at

00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:28.940
negative 1, 2. Then we can move 1 unit right. And 2 units up to give ourselves

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.687
another at 1, 2 and here is a 3rd parabola y equals 3x squared. Notice that the

00:02:35.687 --> 00:02:41.008
turning point of the vertex where this parabola is still at 0,0, the origin. To

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:45.450
find other points on this purple parabola we're going to use our a value. We

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:54.900
can move 1 unit left and 3 units up. This gives us coordinate of negative 1, 3.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.052
To find another point on the graph, we'll go the opposite way. We'll go 1 unit

00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:05.218
right, and this time 3 units up. This gives us a point of 1 comma 3. The a

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:10.120
value is always a quick way to get 1 point that is to the left of the vertex.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.585
And 1 point that is to the right of the vertex whenever parabola is in the form

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:19.054
of y equals. Notice 2 that as the a value gets bigger our parabola stretches

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:22.600
vertically or in other words it gets more narrow.
