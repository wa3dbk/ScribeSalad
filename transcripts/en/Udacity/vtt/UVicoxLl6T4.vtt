00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The question I'm asking here is given this test case that we were to talk about,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is it possible that I can conclude without trying it that this test case will succeed?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What this test case does is enqueues 7, sleeps for a while,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
dequeues an element, and then checks if it was 7, and the answer again is yes. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And again, it depends on making an argument about the actual form of the code for our queue.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you recall that code, the code didn't contain any dependencies on the time 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
at which queue request are out.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Just to be clear, we're trying to make arguments that a single test case is a representative

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of a whole class of actual executions of the system that we're testing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And in the general case, we can't make those arguments.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We can only make these arguments for the specific queue code that we're talking about

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
because we know that, for example, it doesn't depend on the integer value that we're adding. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It doesn't depend on the time at which operations are made

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and that's why these arguments actually work.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What we're actually getting at here is a fairly deep idea. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The idea is we have a single test case that represents a point

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in the input space for the system that we're testing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
By running the code, we mapped that point in the input space to a single point in the output space.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But the problem is, there is of extremely large input space and we can't test it all. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What we're trying to do here is build up an intuition for when we can make an argument 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that, in fact, we haven't made an argument about the mapping of a single input to a single output.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But rather, some class of inputs that are closely related, that are somehow equivalent for purposes

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of the system under test, and that if the system executes correctly for the single input that we've

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
tried, it's going to execute correctly for all of the inputs in this particular bit of the input space. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Let's look at a few ways in which the arguments that we've made here could've gone wrong.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If it's ever the case that our queue could work for some integer,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but not work for general integers, and certainly, it is the case.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
For example, if the Python runtime contains some sort of a bug where large integers were truncated,  

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that it would obviously be the case that if we put one of those large integers into our queue,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
it will get truncated somewhere in the queue processing here,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and what would come out wouldn't be what we had tried to put in.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Similarly, if the Python runtime contained some sort of a garbage collection bug,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that corrupted heap memory--it might be the case that sleeping would give the Python interpreter

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
time to corrupt our value, time to corrupt our queue, and we wouldn't get something out.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But in both of these cases here, we're making arguments about the broader runtime system,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and not the actual code under test and remember that the arguments that we made here

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
they're really only about the actual code that we were testing.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So in summary, we can make these kind of arguments but we have to be extremely careful

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that the assumptions that those arguments are based on are good ones.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What I'd like to do now is give you a little quiz about these concepts.
