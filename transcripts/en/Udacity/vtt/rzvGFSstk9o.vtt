00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.320
Okay, so here is the code for the class Movie

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.180
that we have written thus far. Now, bear in mind, that

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.450
you may have to go into full-screen mode in order

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.020
to see all of the details here properly. And I'm really

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.630
curious to figure out what happens behind the scenes when

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.420
I run this line of code. What happens when I create

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.200
an instance called toy_story by providing these four pieces of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.170
information or arguments. These pieces of information are the name of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.960
the movie, its story line, the link to its poster,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.920
and the link to its YouTube URL. Now clearly, the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.100
last two of these are not really links or URLs

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.020
just yet. They are English phrases and I did that because

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.900
there wasn't enough space on the screen for me to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.490
add the full links or the URLs to the poster and

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.380
the YouTube trailer. So, the first thing that happens when

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.210
we learn this line of code is that the init function

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.250
gets called. And the init function, you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.250
will recall, is the function we defined inside

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.360
class Movie. Self, in that case, is itself

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.910
or the instance being created, which is toy_story.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.420
The next argument is movie_title whose value

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.870
is Toy Story. Movie_storyline gets the value Toys

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.920
come to life. The variable poster_image gets the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.590
right value. And finally, the trailer_youtube variable gets

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.890
the correct link. Okay, so far so good. Now, once init gets called and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.980
all of these arguments receive their correct

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.130
values, all of the variables that are associated

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.269
with the instance toy_story, they get initialized

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.930
appropriately and these variables, you may notice,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.880
are title, storyline, poster_image_url and trailer_youtube_url. At

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.635
this point, if I try to print out

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:45.910
toy_story.storyline, it prints out the correct value. All right,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.790
now that we know exactly what happens when we create

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.700
this instance toy story. Let's go back to our

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.270
design and find out what we have to do next.
