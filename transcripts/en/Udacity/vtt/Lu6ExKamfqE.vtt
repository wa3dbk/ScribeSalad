00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.850
Okay, now we know that the kind is genuine, and the server is genuine. Now what?

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.170
Once again we go back to the principal of not overexposing any ID or

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.980
password for too long on insecure links.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.670
Remember that the login session used the username

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.550
and password exactly once. Now the RPC

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.650
session, you may be establishing multiple RPC sessions.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.950
Over the lifetime of the login session.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.970
Once a login session has been established,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.460
then you are establishing the RPC session.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.380
Now within this RPC session, you may be

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.670
making a number of File system calls. And for all of those file system calls,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.190
you don't want to over expose the use of this handshake key. And therefore

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.240
what the server does in the Android file system is. Use this handshake key

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.920
only for establishing an RPC session. Let's say within a login session, you have

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.270
three or four different RPC sessions, with the server. Three or four unique

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.220
RPC sessions. For each one of those unique RPC sessions, you have to use the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.350
handshake key to establish the RPC session.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.600
But, within an RPS session, what you're doing,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.740
is you're making a whole bunch of secure

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.320
RPS calls, to the server, for opening files,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.270
achieving new files, writing files and so on, and for all of those we don't want

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.450
to over use this hand shaky, and that's the reason, what the server does once

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.180
it validates the indentity of the client,it generates a

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.300
session key. Which is for this particular RPC session. Now it's going to

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.660
send this new session key a generated this particular RPC

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.950
session as an encrypted cipher to the client using

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.940
the hand shaped key. As the private key for encrypting

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.600
this message. And now Venus can extract

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.350
the session key using HKC to decrypt this

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.200
message and this sk is the session key for use for this

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.520
particular RPC session. For the rest of this RPC session, any time the client

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.510
wants to open a file or close a file or write a file or

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.130
read a file, all of those file system

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.200
operations is going to use session key as the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.380
handshake key for the rest of the RPC

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.850
session with the server. The second field, num, is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.700
the starting sequence number that Venus will use

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.920
on behalf of the client for all the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.050
file system related RPC calls that are going

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.120
to be made as part of this particular session.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.860
For this session, SK, is going to be the handshake key, and the sequence numbers

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.420
going to start here. There's again a safeguard against replay attacks on the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.330
server, by someone masquerading as a

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.430
client, and generating packets with certain sequence

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.350
numbers. So let's recap. What went over

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.150
for session establishment. The first message coming

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.660
from the client to the server tells the server that

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.700
a client is wanting to establish a new RPC session. The server has

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.650
to authenticate whether that particular session establishment

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.080
request is genuine or not. And the client has to know

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.850
that it is really talking to a genuine server, and

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.250
that's this pair of communication that you're seeing here.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.670
One to establish to the client that the server

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.610
is genuine, the second to establish to the server

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.220
that the client is genuine. And once the genuineness

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.810
of the client and the server has been established,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.630
the server says, for this particular RPC session, we

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.350
will not use this handshake key anymore for the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.900
rest of the communication that we want to do

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.560
for file system operations. I will generate a new session key, SK.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.860
Give it to you along with the sequence number to use as

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.600
a starting sequence number for RPC calls during this session. That's the

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.670
whole exchange that we're seeing here. Now it's time for a quiz.
