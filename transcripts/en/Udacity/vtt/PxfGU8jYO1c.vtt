00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.680
Some of you may have thought of this

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.620
already, and that is, prior to P two getting

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.460
its lock, it is possible that maybe another processor,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.400
say P three, also used the same lock. And

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.620
so, when it executed its critical section, maybe in

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.280
its critical section, it modified the page X again,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.520
and it creates its own def, let's call it

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.350
Xd prime. Because all of these locks are the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.860
same, When, the DSM software knows that now there are two difs associated with

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.450
this lock, L, one dif is with the processor P one, and another dif is residing

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.180
with processor P three, and therefore when processor P two tries to access x

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.580
The DSM software has not only to get the diff from P one, but it also needs

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.920
to get the diff from P two and apply it to the original, pristine

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.430
version of the page that is with the owner of the page so that it can create

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280
the current version of the page. And it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.610
can extend this to any number of processors.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.180
That may have made modifications, their own modifications,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.460
to this page under the provision of the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.112
lock L. All of those diffs are going to be applied in order for the process of P

00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:27.050
two to access the page as the current page. If after accessing the page

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.890
x and its execution P two. Touches let's say page Z at that point once again

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.430
the [INAUDIBLE] knows that, oh, I know that

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.080
Z was modified by the previous lock holder

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.540
Zd is the diff I know where to find it I'll bring the original copy of z from...

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.150
The owner of Z and apply the diffs to

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.750
it before letting P two access Z. So you can

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.520
see, that even though the invalidation was done right

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.600
at the beginning, we're procrastinating getting the this til

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.230
the point of access. So this is what LRC

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.240
allows you to do is just bring in what this

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.288
guy needs. So for instance, inside this critical

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:13.130
section maybe only X is accessed. Y and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.935
Z are not accessed at all, in which case, we never bring the diffs from P one

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:23.255
to P two for y and z.P two On the other hand, it is possible that P

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:26.030
two, as part of its execution of its

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.910
critical section. Modifies another page Q, different from X,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.870
Y, and Z. So now, the DSM software knows that this particular lock is associated

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.440
not just with X, Y, and Z, but it is also associated with Q. So future lock

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.960
request for L will result in invalidating X, Y, Z, and Q because all of those

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.870
may have been modified and the next critical

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.220
section that wants to access this lock L has

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.860
to get the current versions of all the pages that were ever associated with L.
