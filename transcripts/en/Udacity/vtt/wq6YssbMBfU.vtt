00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.718
Well, if you actually tried this, you will see that you get 434. That's a

00:00:04.718 --> 00:00:09.610
little unfortunate. The reason here is if you remember that 4.35 times 100

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.970
because of round off was 434.99 something. And the 0.99 something is the

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.930
fractional part, and that was thrown away to get this integer. To really do

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.712
this right in Java, you have to use a pretty arcane formula that's in fact so

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:30.724
arcane that I have to look it up. You use a mathematical function called round

00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:38.459
that gets you the closest integer. So, 4.35 times 100 may be 434.999. But the

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:44.556
closest integer to that is 435. And then, for reasons that are too depressing

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:49.262
to have to get into, you still have to cast that into int. We have a fact sheet

00:00:49.262 --> 00:00:53.200
that you can consult if you actually run into this situation. The round

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.130
function here is one example of a mathematical function. There's a bunch of

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.936
them, and we'll take them up soon, but first let's do another programming

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:01.150
exercise.
