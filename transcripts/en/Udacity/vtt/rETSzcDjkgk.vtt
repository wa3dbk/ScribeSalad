00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.530
Finally, we need to get the client to ask for

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.470
the right image to be downloaded. That is, it needs to

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.070
know what device pixel ration the device is using, and potentially

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.490
the layout size too, if it's responsive to the layout width.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.350
And then request only the appropriate image. This last part

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.000
is the hard part, because the web browser tries to kick

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.420
off the image downloads. As early as possible. Which of course

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.540
is a good thing for getting content on the screen quickly,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.590
but bad if the client asks for more than

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.870
one version, particularly on a mobile device with limited bandwidth.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.040
So how do you think we should approach this problem

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580
of asking for the right image at the right time?
