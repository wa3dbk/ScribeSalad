00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.719
The Internet is an extraordinarily complex creature, using a

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.100
wide variety of hardware and communication protocols. To help

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.150
make sense of it all, most any discussion of

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.740
networking begins with the notion of interconnection layers, an idea

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.550
that captures the most important relationships among the Internet's

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.450
components. Several attempts have been made to formalize these, most

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.550
notably the seven-layer OSI model, and the four layer

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.080
Internet protocol suite. We use a hybrid model here and

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.240
try to keep the discussion intuitive. The physical layer

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.000
refers to hardware that actually creates and transmits the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.850
electronic and optical signals, as well as the protocols

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.790
for interpreting these signals as bits. This would include

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.900
the network interface card inside your computer, the modem

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.540
that your Internet service provider gave you or recommended

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.270
that you buy. For ethernet cable connecting your modem

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.230
to your computer, and even submarine fiber optic cables that

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.010
stretch across the world's oceans. Protocols are interpreting the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.810
signals sent across these media include physical ethernet and sonnet.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.630
The link layer covers the communication between peers on a

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.840
local network. The most trivial topology for a local network

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.460
is just point to point, where there is a

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.610
permanent link between two end points. We can also have

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.910
more complex topologies, however, where multiple nodes are all connected

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.520
to the same medium, and feel all each other's signals.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.680
The challenge here becomes making sure that they don't

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.330
all talk at the same time. The link layer also

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.705
encompasses switching, where connections between nodes are made on an

00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:28.960
as-needed basis to reduce the potential for crosstalk. The network

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.730
layer is responsible for end-to-end communication on the internet. When

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.290
you request a page from the Udacity website, the data

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.920
doesn't come directly from our servers, but goes through several

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.580
intervening machines. This process of routing the data, or figuring

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.810
out what path the data should take, belongs to the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.390
network layer. Unlike other layers, which have evolved to include many

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.940
different technologies, the network layer is governed almost exclusively by

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.440
the Internet protocol and the system of IP addresses. Now, once

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.450
data reaches your machine, there has to be some way

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.590
of knowing which application it is intended for. Also, communication isn't

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.630
perfect, so we need some mechanism for detecting when data goes

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.700
missing, arrives out of order, or when the connection is overloaded.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.490
Coping with these situations is the job of the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.410
transport layer. And lastly at the highest level, we

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.270
have the application layer, which includes application specific protocols,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.340
such as HTTP for web, SMTP for mail, etc.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.450
The relationship between these layers is mostly one of

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.940
using. The link layer uses the physical layer to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.360
accomplish its goal of enabling point-to-point communication across a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.070
shared medium. The network layer uses the link layer

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.480
to accomplish its goal of end-to-end communication between two

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.580
machines on the internet. The transport layer uses the network

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.280
layer to accomplish its goal of reliable end-to-end communication

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.570
between applications. And the application layer uses the transport layer

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.100
to accomplish its goal, whatever it may be, whether

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.880
it's fetching a website, sending an email, or streaming a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.750
movie. The plan for this lesson will be to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.910
start at the bottom layer and move our way up.
