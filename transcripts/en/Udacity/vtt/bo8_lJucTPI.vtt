00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.713
Shown here is the homepage for dimple js.

00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:06.960
You can find it at dimplejs.org.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.960
As I mentioned, dimple is a library built atop of d3

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.630
that allows us to work at the abstraction level lower chart.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.660
Rather than lower level abstractions like visual end codings,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.710
such as shape, scale and positioning.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.470
The reason I'll be using dimple.js instead of

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.240
another charting library is three-fold, as outlined on their site.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.012
Dimple is built atop d3.

00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:36.427
Has a very gentle learning curve and designed for analysts.

00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:38.120
And the last reason and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.090
what's pretty unique to dimple is that it exposes the native d3 objects.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.930
So if you do want to get more complicated and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.920
ween yourself off of using all of dimple's convenience methods.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.820
You can access the underlying d3 objects themselves.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.470
As I mentioned dimple.js exists as a tool to

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.350
make business analysts more productive with charts.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.860
But to allow the flexibility to extend the visualizations for power users.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.530
Even though we saw d3 in lesson one, we only manipulated HTML objects and

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.220
a little SVG, and did not get into any data driven operations.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.066
We will be using d3 itself to create interactive visualizations and

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.496
animations in lesson four.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:27.304
But for now, since we're only creating charts and

00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:29.400
since many awesome libraries exist.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.184
They abstract a lot of the complexities of building charts yourself with d3,

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:36.660
we'll be using the libraries instead.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.430
This pattern that d3 defines to bind data to some elements on the page

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.910
is often one of the most confusing topics for newcomers to d3 to understand.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.740
Most often due to the .enter and .exit commands you can call on your data.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.960
These are only really relevant if you're adding and removing elements on a given

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.660
webpage in an animation, transition, or interaction.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.990
They are necessary, however, for any simple visualization you do,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.870
even if you don't have any interaction or animation in it.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.510
Rather than explain this pattern now and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.880
having you wonder why there's this dot enter, or how it could be used.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.620
I'll save the explanation for lesson four when

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.570
we will fully understand what's going on behind the scenes here.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.480
And how we can leverage it to create some pretty awesome interactive

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.220
animations and visualizations.
