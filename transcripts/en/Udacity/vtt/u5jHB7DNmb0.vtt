00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
We see that there are both internal
and external causes for motivations.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.130
The internal factors may be things such as
being hungry, thirsty, or even in pain.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.770
On the other hand the external factors
can include things such as,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.550
the sight of food, or the sight
of a pretty person,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.670
or a stimulus that indicates danger.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.680
We see that motivation is
the urge to move to one's goals.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.750
This involves needs,
drives, and incentives.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.130
So, let's define these.
For first, let's start with needs.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.750
Needs are states of cellular
or bodily deficiency

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.190
that compel or drive our body
to seek out what it needs.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.830
For example, we need food.
We need liquid or water.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.040
And we need oxygen.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.850
So, in addition to needs,
we also have drives.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.380
Drives are perceived states of tension

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.900
that occur when our bodies
are deficient in some need.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.630
And this intern creates the urge
to relieve the tension.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.360
So, the deficiency creates the drive,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.690
and our physiological
needs have the drive component.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.519
Drives intern lead us to do something
to satisfy the need, and the drive,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.520
and they lead to motivated behaviors.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.880
We also have what called incentives.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.930
An incentive is an external object,
or event that motivates our behavior.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.740
You may have a motivation to do well
at work to earn a monetary bonus,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.510
and the monetary bonus, is the incentive
that you're working towards.
