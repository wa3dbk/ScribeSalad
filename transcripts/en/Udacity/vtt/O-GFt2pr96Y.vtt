00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.936
So let's lose our coordinate grid and all of those right triangles. That's

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:08.888
right, we've gone off the grid. We just have one piece of string centered at

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:15.900
the origin, 0,0. And we have the end of the string at some point x comma y. We

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.100
know that if we were to rotate this piece of string anywhere, we would create a

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.165
circle by the position of the end of the string. So, what's that equation that

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:29.885
we can write relating x and y, and the length of the string? If you think about

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:33.168
relating the horizontal distance and this vertical distance with the length of

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:37.180
the string, I'm sure you can come up with the correct equation.
