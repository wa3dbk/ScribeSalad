Very cool. Alright, here's how my verify algorithm works.

00:00:04.323 --> 00:00:08.323
First, I make sure that we have a mapping

00:00:08.323 --> 00:00:09.888
from all of the nodes of the graph to--

00:00:09.888 --> 00:00:12.407
Hmm, I didn't check everything-- Well here's what I checked

00:00:12.407 --> 00:00:14.956
Make sure that the number of nodes in the coloring

00:00:14.956 --> 00:00:16.472
matches the number of nodes in the graph.

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:18.323
If not, then this is not a good coloring.

00:00:18.323 --> 00:00:22.539
Then for each node in the coloring list,

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.389
well, if it's the case that the coloring for the node

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:30.658
is not a valid color, then we say that's bad

00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:34.172
and then we check all of the neighbors of the node,

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:38.506
and we check for each combination of node and its neighbor,

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:40.190
whether the colorings match, and if any of the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.089
colorings match, that's bad, because that means

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.007
two adjacent regions with the same color,

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:45.440
so we return false.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.556
And if we survive all of those tests,

00:00:47.556 --> 00:00:50.524
then at the end of the day we return 'true'.

00:00:50.524 --> 00:00:52.588
The thing that I didn't check for that I probably

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:54.339
should have checked for, is to make sure that

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.372
the nodes that are in use in the certificate,

00:00:58.372 --> 00:01:00.658
are the same as the nodes that in use in the graph.

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:02.056
That would be kind of weird.

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.271
Or, if it has nodes that aren't in the graph,

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:07.889
then this will actually crash, which is not good,

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:09.290
so I probably should have checked for that.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.622
But the essence of it is just this:

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:14.533
We're running through all of the edges in the graph,

00:01:14.533 --> 09:59:59.000
and making sure that the colors don't match.
