00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.969
The process of configuration is also related to planning.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.780
You can consider a planner that actually generates the plan in this plan

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.670
obstruction hierarchy. But then for any plan in this plan obstruction hierarchy,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.260
then it converts a plan in this plan obstruction hierarchy into a skeletal plan.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.670
It drops the values of the variables in the plans and constructs it

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.540
into a plan it's simply specify the variable without specifying the values.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.130
The process of configuration planning then, takes these plans,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.740
organizes them into obstruction hierarchy and goes about [INAUDIBLE] shading and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.470
refining and expanding them. We already discussed how configuration is

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.960
connected to a number of other lessons like case based reasoning, planning and

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.000
classification. You may also consider this plan to be kind of strict for

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.880
physical object. In addition, this plans have been learned,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.260
through learning methods similar to the method of incremental concept learning.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.530
In addition, this plan hierarchy might be learned through learning methods

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.830
similar to the method for incremental concept learning. One of the things that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.129
we are doing in knowledge based AI is, to describe the kinds of knowledge that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.210
we need to learn. Before we decide on what is a good learning method, we need to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.720
decide on what is it we need to learn? The configuration process tells us

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.180
of the different kinds of knowledge that then become targets of learning.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.480
To connect this lesson back to our cognitive architecture,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.110
consider this figure once again. So knowledge of the prototypical chair,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.690
as well as knowledge about the radius, plans, and the abstraction hierarchy

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.190
are stored in memory. As the input gives specification with the design problem,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.390
the reasoning component instantiates those plans, refines them and expands them.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.080
The knowledge itself is learned through examples of configuration of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.927
chairs that presumably, the agent is already encountered previously.
