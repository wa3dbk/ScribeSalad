00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.030
We said that there are two types
of snooping coherence approaches.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.700
One was write update,
the other was write invalidate.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.470
So going back to our optimized write
update setup where we had the valid and

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.280
the tag bits, also the dirty bit for
write back cashes and

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.660
a shared bit that tells us
whether we are alone in this.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.800
A write invalidate protocol will
broadcast writes on the Bus so

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.940
that they can be seen by everybody.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.150
But instead of updating their copies,
they will invalidate them.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.520
So let's see how this works.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.930
Let's say this core reads A.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.800
We send this, get the value from memory.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.250
Now we have it as valid, not dirty.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.070
The tag is A, the value is,
let's say 0, and it's not shared.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.250
Let's say now we have the write to A,
and write 1 to it.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.030
We have a cache miss,
we broadcast the write.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.180
We now don't need to broadcast the value
with it because the other caches don't

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.350
need this value.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.735
What's going to happen is
as we send this to the Bus,

00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:07.540
it's going to be snooped
by this cache and

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.140
it sees that somebody's trying to write
to the block that they have in my cache.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.122
In our write update protocol we will
now need the value to put it here.

00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:21.830
In a write invalidate protocol all
we do is change the valid bit to 0.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.090
So now we will miss in
the cache next time we read,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.050
this particular cache
now gets the valid.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.540
It's not shared,
every time we do a write with broadcast

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.340
we know it's not shared because all
the other copies have been destroyed so

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.870
our write makes., The block non
shared in the writing processor.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.300
It is dirty and
now it has a value of one.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.270
So now a read of A here, in a write
update protocol would be a hit and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.170
just read here, but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.430
in a write invalidate protocol,
the read will still get the new value.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.840
It's not going to be incoherent, because
it doesn't get the value of zero.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.970
It will not be a miss,
and be sent to the Bus.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.820
Now the memory has bot been updated yet,
but the processor who has the dirty data

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.540
and matches the address of the blog
will see that there is a read request on

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.150
the Bus and respond with the data,
so now the blog becomes valid.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.590
Somebody gave us the data, so
definitely now it's shared.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.690
We get the data, and
the cache where we wrote

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.260
now also know's it's shared
because we gave it to somebody.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.180
So, clearly we are not the only
one who has it anymore.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.180
So now note that just like
in a write update protocol,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.450
if we have a lot of reads now
they can have cache hits.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.600
Another write will invalidate this so
there will be a cache miss also.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.890
So, the disadvantage of writing
invalidate protocols is that there is

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.620
a miss on all the readers
when somebody writes.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.670
However, there is an advantage to it
as well in that if you need to update

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.710
the same block twice,
let's say write two to A.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.480
We invalidate this copy by broadcasting.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.820
Now the block is no longer shared.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.050
We put two there.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.410
So we have the broadcast for
this first write.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.010
If we now do some more reads and
writes, they can all be done locally.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.160
We don't have to broadcast them.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.650
So basically by invalidating this copy,
we made ourselves be the only one

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.920
who has the block and now we don't
need to broadcast all the writes.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.610
So, for anything where one
core works on it for a while,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.320
then another one works on it for
a while, if the work involves writing,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.640
only the first write really
has to be broadcast.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.790
After that, it's a local access for
both reads and writes.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.080
In contrast with write update,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.630
we would have to keep updating the other
cache until it replaces the block.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.650
Just like with write update.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.440
Writing validate can benefit from the
type of optimization when we are writing

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.280
to different blocks and
accessing it later.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.400
So in that case B is fetched here
is not shared becomes dirty and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.910
C is fetched here is not shared
becomes dirty and gets a value of 1.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.520
And now we can have cache
hits on both reads and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.430
writes without going to the Bus for
B here.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.000
And we can access C here
with no going to the Bus.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.890
So for blocks that are only accessed on
one core we have the same behavior for

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.720
both write update and write invalidate.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.200
But for blocks that are shared
we get different behavior.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.940
Write update tends to
result in more hits but

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.070
does more broadcasts,
if we repeatedly update.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.910
Write invalidate generates a miss on
all the readers after a write occurred.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.740
But it allows us to locally
write after the first write.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.320
Note that with write update,
we ensured for

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.740
A that the second property
of coherence is maintained.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.310
By updating all the copies.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.180
So when a write occurs,
all copies are up to date, and

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.630
thus they will return
the new value of the write.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.980
With write invalidate,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.350
we ensure the same property by the write
invalidating all the other copies so

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.620
that now they have no choice but
to get the new version of the data.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.270
So either way, reads will get
the new version of the data but

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.320
that is achieved in different ways.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.230
The third property of coherence is

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.490
still ensured by snooping in a write
invalidate protocol with snooping.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.350
So basically snooping on
the Bus still ensures that

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.530
any writes that need to go to
the Bus because there is sharing

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.090
will be ordered by the order
by which they go to the Bus.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.080
So for example,
a write here will invalidate everything.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.560
Now a write here has to put a request
on the Bus because it's a miss.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.060
And also train the copy from here and
now everybody knows what the order was.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.860
In fact, at any given time, only the
last version really survives in caches.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.590
Because a write invalidates
all the other copies.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.760
So it's pretty clear
whose version was last,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.370
because all the readers need to get
the copy that was written last anyway.
