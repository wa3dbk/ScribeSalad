00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.520
If you carefully inspect the exit selection,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.689
you'll notice here that item 17 happens to be missing.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.990
It jumps from 16 to 18.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.280
And here I'm re-running the SVG select all code.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.220
On just circles to see all the circles, and what they're bound to.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.230
Scrolling down we can see here item 17 happens to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.380
correspond to a circle that has data with key 1930.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.110
So as you can see, since we're updating the year 1930.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.420
And we're binding the filtered year, which only corresponds to 1930.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.440
The exit selection is everything that doesn't belong on the page.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.130
Basically, every circle except year 1930.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.360
And in this binding we simply tell d3 to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.040
update year 1930 in case any of the data that was bound to it has changed.
