So from our last two quizzes, we now have
developed a new expression for total money

00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:09.464
earned by Grant. Instead of money from
wipers, we have 36w, where w is the amount

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:15.136
that each set of wipers cost. And instead
of money earned from nozzles, we have 11 times

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:20.324
2n, where n is equal to the amount that a
person pays for one nozzle. Now when I

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.954
look at this term 11 times 2n, it looks a little
bit complicated to me, definitely more

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:31.139
complicated than 36w does. Can you think
of a simpler way to write 11 times 2n?

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:35.279
Now, there are a ton of different ways that we
can write 11 times 2n and come up with a

00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:39.885
mathematically equivalent expression, but
I would prefer that we try to come up with

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.525
a simpler way to write this. So, if you
have an idea of how to do that, please

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.805
type it into this box right here.
