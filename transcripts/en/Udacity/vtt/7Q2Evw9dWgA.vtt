00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.090
Let's now take a look at layering.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.450
By and large, security is enhanced because it is straightforward to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.920
add a security layer between the system and its environment.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.000
As far as the effect of the other four qualities on layering, performance may

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.450
be reduced because the response to external events must be passed up and

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.350
down the layers, which may in, may also increase context swapping.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.710
Maintainability, on the other hand,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.200
might be improved because of the stable interlayer protocols and

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.890
interfaces would lead to well-defined and reusable components.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.880
It may even be possible to replace an entire layer or insert other layers.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.350
Reliability may be reduced because an event may be handled in multiple layers.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.500
That is, making it hard to find,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.360
when something goes wrong, what the responsible layer is.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.670
However the higher layers may have an oversight capability to provide

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.380
the necessary redundancy to improve reliability.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.700
As far as safety is concerned, similar to security,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.380
it maybe easy to insert safety monitoring layers.
