00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.180
There are many ways to gain users but
in the beginning a promotional offer or

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.860
incentives are great tools.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.470
There are many different types of
promotional offers you can use to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.270
attract new users.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.985
If you have an app that
people need to pay for,

00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:16.105
you can offer a free trial to it.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:19.715
If it's a free app you can
offer a premium version.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:21.845
For example with abarkment
we offer the app for

00:00:21.845 --> 00:00:26.222
free but, maybe we can give them
their first booking without any fees.

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:27.572
There's so many options.

00:00:27.572 --> 00:00:31.922
You could host a give away for a service
or a product related to your app.

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:34.562
You can offer discounts to products or
services you offer.

00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:37.902
You can give away bonus points
that they could use for

00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:39.532
something else on your site.

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:42.772
You can even come up with a special
offer for referring someone new.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.630
You and a friend,
$10 off your next order.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.310
The bottom line is you want to get
people excited enough about the offer so

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.620
they share it.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.440
And once your promotion is on social
channels or in a press release,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.170
it's more likely to go viral and
attract more users to your app.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.030
Now it's really wise to track your
promotions that you're offering.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
That way you can figure out what
promotions work the best and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.150
give you the most return on investment.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.030
You can use this by tracking
a discount code people use.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.290
Or using something like Google Analytics
to track traffic to your site

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.985
after you release a promotion.

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:20.575
We're going to cover Analytics
more in lesson five, but

00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:23.735
we want to get you in the mindset
of measuring everything you can.

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:26.985
That way, you can make future
decisions based on your results.

00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:29.575
Now let's see what Noam has to
say about promotional offers and

00:01:29.575 --> 00:01:30.765
incentives to gain users.
