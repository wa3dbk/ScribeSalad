00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.460
In a previous unit, you covered
supervised learning, which was a way of

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.430
teaching a system to understand
some concept based on some labeled,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.070
incoming data.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.290
But what about if
the data wasn't labeled?

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.580
So we use the example of teaching
a system to recognize my face.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.470
But that involved having a bunch of
pictures that a person had already

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.290
gone through and said,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.170
these are pictures of David, and
these are pictures of other people.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.580
What if we didn't have that?

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.270
What if we wanted to just teach the
system that understands similar faces

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.220
without going through and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.430
actually coding which ones were
the same person in advance?

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.300
That's where unsupervised
learning comes in.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.450
Unsupervised learning is helping
a system learn a concept based on

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.930
the unlabeled data, so

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.350
it just learns the ideas just based
on the data that's already there.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.160
This is very useful in
other domains as well.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.820
In healthcare, for example,
supervised learning can be

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.600
used to help a system identify
which patients are at risk for

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.990
a certain disease early if we
already know what the disease is.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.950
But unsupervised learning could actually
help us uncover diseases that we didn't

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.250
even know existed,
based on patterns of common symptoms.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.310
So in unsupervised learning, we're
really going to learn about how systems

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.430
can learn new and interesting things,
based on unlabeled, incoming data.
