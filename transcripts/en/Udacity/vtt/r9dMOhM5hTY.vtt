00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.380
So how do you use means ends analysis to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices?

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.120
What exactly is our goal in this context?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.390
You might think of the goal in different ways. We might think of it as,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.550
the goal is to solve the problem or in a different sense we might think of

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.120
the goal as the transform sum frame into another frame. And then trace back and

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.250
find what the transformation was? In that context how would you then measure

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.640
distance? We noticed that distance is important in doing means ends analysis

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.560
because that helps us decide what to do next. Once you have a measure of how to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.840
actually measure distance to your goal what are the individual operators or

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.500
moves that you can take to actually move closer to your goal and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.270
how would you weight them to be able to decide what to do at any given time.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.970
In addition, what are the overall strengths of using means and

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.460
analysis as a problem solving approach in this context,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.170
and what are its limitations. Is it well suited for these problems, or are there

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.150
perhaps other things that we can be doing that aren't necessarily under this

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.980
topic that would actually make the problem even easier.
