00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now we're ready to think about how we should represent

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the index for our web content corpus.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And we're going to have a quiz to see if you can think of a good way to represent our index.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So I'm going to give you several options.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And try to decide which one you think would be the best way to represent our index.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I should note that several of these could work.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We could build a search index using different data structures,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and if we tried hard enough, we could make many of these possibilities work.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But I want you to think hard about what's going to be the best one to use.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So the first option is we could have a single list

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
where we have a keyword followed by the URLs where that keyword appears

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
followed by another keyword followed by the URLs where that keyword appears.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The second option would be we would have a list

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
containing as its elements lists.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And each element would be a list of the keyword followed by the URLs where that keyword appears.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The third option, we could have a list where each element of the list

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is a list where the first element is the URL,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and the second element is a list of all the keywords that are found on that page.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The fourth choice is a list where each element is a list

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and each element list is a keyword followed by a list

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of all the URLs that contain that keyword.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So see if you can decide which one of these four representations

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
will be the best one to use to represent the index for our web content corpus.
