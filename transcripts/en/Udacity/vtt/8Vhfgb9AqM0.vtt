00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.394
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is one of the most common childhood

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:09.082
disorders in the United States. And it can continue into adolescence and

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:13.376
adulthood. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, symptoms

00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:17.034
include difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty in

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:22.980
controlling behavior and hyperactivity. Let's look at three types of symptoms.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.221
First we have inattention. Someone who has symptoms of inattention can be

00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:31.486
easily distracted. They may miss details or forget things and they frequently

00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:36.135
switch from one behavior activity to another. They can become bored with a task

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:38.925
after only a few minutes, unless they are doing something that they really

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:43.540
enjoy. This means they can have trouble completing or turning in homework

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.828
assignments. They often lose things needed to complete a task, and they seem to

00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:52.455
not listen when spoken to. Furthermore, they may daydream, become easily

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:57.553
confused, and even struggle to follow directions or instructions. A child who

00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:02.257
has symptoms of hyperactivity may squirm or fidget in their seat. Someone with

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:06.129
symptoms of hyperactivity may talk nonstop. They may run around touching and

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:09.824
playing with everything in sight. They have trouble sitting still at dinner, at

00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:13.660
school. And thus they may get in trouble from teachers as well as parents for

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.245
their hyperactivity. Now let's look at impulsivity. Symptoms of impulsivity

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:23.040
means a person may be very impatient. They may blurt out inappropriate comments

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.250
or show their emotions without restraint. And they may often act out without

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.260
regard for consequences. They may have difficulty waiting for things that they

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.557
want, and they may interrupt people's conversations or activities. Now as you

00:01:35.557 --> 00:01:38.905
can imagine, children experiencing a combination of these symptoms, can

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:42.361
experience great difficulty in managing their day to day behaviors that are

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.979
necessary, and needed for doing well in school, or interacting with others, and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.100
completing a daily routine. And not all attention deficit disorders will be

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.996
exactly the same. You'll see some who are more inattentive rather than

00:01:55.996 --> 00:02:01.201
hyperactive, and some who are more impulsive rather than inattentive. In order

00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:06.462
to be diagnosed with ADHD, one must meet a set of diagnostic criteria. That is

00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:10.550
comprised of a number of symptoms of this disorder. And now the causes of ADHD,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.310
or Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Disorder, include a combination of genes,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.654
and environmental factors. Now for a long time, people suspected that the

00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:27.032
consumption of sugar caused ADHD. However, there's no research that's provided

00:02:27.032 --> 00:02:28.679
support for that idea.
