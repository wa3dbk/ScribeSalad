00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.255
Now, where were we with Grant? Oh, that's right, he was on the plane. He's on

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:08.586
the plane going from home to the Cxpo in the city Udacity. But Grant is super

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:13.119
impatient and he would really love to find out where the halfway point between

00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:17.312
his hometown and Udacity is. He found out earlier that the exact distance

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:21.918
between these 2 points is the square root of 530,000, in miles, of course. So,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.542
he just measure half of the square root of 530000 along this line, that doesn't

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:30.927
seem like a very exact or very easy to do either. But just by looking at our

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.774
graph, I'd like you to give me an estimate for the midpoint is. That is, what if

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:40.373
a coordinates of the point that's halfway between these 2 points along this

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:40.662
line?
