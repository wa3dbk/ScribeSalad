00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.680
Okay. So the most ideal situation would be, if all instructions that we need to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.860
execute just go through the pipeline in the same stage. So basically, all of,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.960
all of them will end up executing in the same cycle.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.780
Let's see an example of this. So we have a nice table here. And

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.390
now we're going to have some five instructions here. So let's have instructions,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.420
so here is where we're basically just going to have our instructions. And

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.046
let's say that you know, the first instruction is an ADD instruction. R1 equals

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:36.760
R2 plus R3. I'm going to draw it like this so that we don't have to

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.860
actually have the opcodes and everything else clutter the screen. And

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.480
then we have R4 equals R1 minus R5.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:56.486
And then we have xor R6 equals R7 X or R8.

00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:02.718
And then we will have R5 equals R8 times R9.

00:01:02.718 --> 00:01:09.780
And finally we will have an add of R4 equals R8 plus R9.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.956
So remember these are instructions, not actual C-operations, it's just that I am

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:17.726
kind of showing them like this because it is a more compact representations of

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:22.092
them. And now let's see what happens in a pipeline where we do this for

00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:26.209
a five stage pipeline. So in the first cycle, so this is cycle 1,

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.529
this will be fetched and this will be fetched and this will be fetched and

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:35.770
this will be fetched and this will be fetched. And then in cycle 2,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.790
we will decode this and read registers, and decode this and read registers, and

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.450
decode this and read registers, and so on. And now if you remember your five

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.400
stage flight plan, the time comes to execute this thing. So if we just get all

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.470
five of them here and execute them. We will have a very good CPI. In reality,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.050
what's going to happen is that we are going to eventually write the results for

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.590
all of these things. And if we had more instructions here,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.540
it wouldn't matter. All of this would be done in basically five cycles. So

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.640
if we have five cycles for a very large number of instructions, the CPI is going

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.760
to be five cycles for pretty much an infinite number of instructions which

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.220
is going to be very close to 0. So we get a CPI for 0, which is very good.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.340
You know, you are getting basically 0, almost 0 cycles per instruction. So

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.900
that's wonderful. So what's wrong with something like this? Well what's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.100
wrong with it is that when we execute these instructions what has happened

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.330
is this instruction and this instruction have red registers at the same time.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.510
Remember that the decode stage is also the read register stage.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.670
So, what happens here is, we are here adding the R2 plus R3.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.630
And here, when we are writing, we are really writing R1. Okay?

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.330
But when we are adding here. I mean are subtracting R5 from R1.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.990
This R1 here is not the R1 that this instruction is writing.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.960
It's the R1 that we read before that instruction managed to write anything.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.920
What's wrong with this is that this first instruction is going to execute

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.320
correctly, but the second instruction because we are executing it too early,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.420
is going to basically read the R1 from before the first instruction so

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.330
it doesn't get the result of the first instruction. So the programmer that wrote

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.000
this wanted this R1 to be this R1. It was supposed to be like this, but

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.340
it isn't. And that means that we will have to do something about this.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.910
We cannot just let instructions execute in the same cycle.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.380
We actually have to figure out which ones can execute and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.300
which ones cannot execute in the same cycle.
