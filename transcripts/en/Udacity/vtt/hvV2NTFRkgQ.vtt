00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.480
It's true that this session is over, but

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.010
it's false to think that you won't
be seeing boolean expressions again.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.530
These constructs are the meat and

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.270
bones of another programming
construct called if else statements.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.750
We'll talk about these soon.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.880
See you in the next session.
