00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.265
Every time x increases by 10, y increases by 5. To get from 0 to 10, we have to

00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:10.580
add 10. And from 10 to 20, add 10 again, and so on and so forth for the rest of

00:00:10.592 --> 00:00:15.770
the x values. We're stepping by 10 every time. On the y side however, each

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:21.636
number is 5 greater than the last one. So, the change from table entry to table

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:25.520
entry, is 10 in the x column, but 5 in the y column.
