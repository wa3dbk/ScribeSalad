So, continuing with cognitive development and Piaget stages, we're going to

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:09.445
move on to childhood development. Here we the preoperational stage, this covers

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:14.852
the preschool years, from about 2 to 6 depending on the person. So, what makes

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:19.600
something preoperational? To answer that, we need to know what operational is.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.304
An operation is a mental ability to figure something out in ones head. It's

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:27.640
like problem solving, or trying to do a math problem in your head. Well, young

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.055
children can't quite do this yet, so they're preoperational.
