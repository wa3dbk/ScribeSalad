Hey James, what do you say about treating a displayProjects function that will

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:12.500
handle all of our projects and display them on a page?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.330
&gt;&gt; I have a better idea.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.440
We only just touch the surface of what objects can do.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.170
Let's take a look at them first, and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.110
then we'll finish off our resume using our newfound knowledge of objects.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.820
Does that work for you?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.060
Why don't you start us off?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.250
&gt;&gt; We saw earlier that we define objects with these curly braces.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.080
And we also include code for functions inside the curly braces.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.810
Guess what?

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.140
Functions are objects.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.680
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.250
&gt;&gt; I know you knew that already.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.160
It's a little bit crazy, but pretty much everything in JavaScript is really

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.180
an object when you get right down to it.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.300
There's a link in the instructor's notes with implications from

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.850
the relationship between functions and object.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.190
For our purposes it's useful to note that objects can

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.310
encapsulate functions as well.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.190
For instance, let's create display as a method of the projects object.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.860
Projects, the object,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.120
already includes all of our data about all of the projects we've completed.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.400
And now it's going to include a function that will help us display

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.680
those projects.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.340
Using dot notation here,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.590
we can add a new property to the projects object called display.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.910
And we'll set it equal to a function.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.730
Within these curly braces, we'll define what the function display will do.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.370
Even though we defined the projects object with object literal notation,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.860
it doesn't matter how we defined the projects object,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.350
we can still crreate this property display using dot notation.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.990
This is called encapsulation,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.440
meaning that we're holding the display function inside the projects object.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.370
It's a nice way to organize our code into logical domains and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.680
JavaScript makes it really easy to do so.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.280
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.830
So what should go inside projects.display?

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.750
&gt;&gt; Hm, you know what?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.220
Let's let the students decide first.
