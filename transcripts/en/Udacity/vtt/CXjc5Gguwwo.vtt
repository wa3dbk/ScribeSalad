So what is language? Well, words are just arbitrary sounds put together. Which

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.980
is clear when you listen to languages that you don't know. However, when it's a

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.580
language that you do know, these sounds have deep and immediate meaning.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.580
Language expresses ideas, thoughts, and intentions. Language and thought go

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.924
really well together. However, they're not the exact same thing. We can express

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:26.554
thoughts without language sometimes. For example, if we use things like

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:29.200
imagery, art, music, or even dance.
