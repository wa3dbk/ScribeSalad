00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:02.272
Let's talk about thread blocks and why they're there.

00:00:02.272 --> 00:00:04.656
Hopefully, you have some questions about how the GPU works,

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:09.879
since we've just sort of been telling you about threads and thread blocks without giving you much motivation.

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.882
You might be wondering why do we divide the problem into blocks.

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.284
When do blocks get run?

00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:17.353
And if you have a whole bunch of thread blocks, in what order do they run?

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:20.662
And I've told you that thread blocks were about letting groups of threads cooperate.

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:23.825
But I haven't told you how those threads cooperate or with what limitations.

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:26.694
To answer this we're going to have to dive in to learn

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:28.265
a little bit more about the GPU hardware.

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:31.434
At a high level, a Cuda GPU is a bunch of these.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:35.036
We call them streaming multiprocessors or SMs for short.

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:38.487
Now, different GPUs have a different number of SMs.

00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:40.743
A small GPU might only have one SM

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:44.713
whereas a really big GPU might have 16 SMs, for example.

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:49.822
An SM in turn has many simple processors that can run a bunch of parallel threads.

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:53.789
It also has some other things like some memory that we'll talk more about in a moment.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.927
When you've got a Cuda program with a bunch of threads organized into thread blocks,

00:00:57.927 --> 00:01:03.768
the important thing to understand is that the GPU is responsible for allocating blocks to SMs.

00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:06.270
Let me say that again because it's really important,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.073
the GPU is responsible for allocating the blocks to the SMs.

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:14.345
As a programmer, all you have to worry about is giving the GPU a big pile of thread blocks,

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:17.782
and the GPU will take care of assigning them to run on the hardware SMs.

00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:20.790
All the SMs run in parallel and independently.
