00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Y = bx + a, the key holy grail in linear regression and in much of  statistics is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
how to use data to determine the value of b and the value of a.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So if you can do this with data, then we solve the problem of fitting the best line

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and that's once again called linear regression.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So I won't give you the derivation but I'll give you the formula. Let's start with b.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Assuming your data comes in pairs for x and y as indicated here

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the formula for b might look really complex at first but I promise you it isn't.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Just in the calculations of the variance, we take the difference between x and the mean of x,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but rather than squaring this as in the variance case, we now do a product with the same term for the y's.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So important here, this notation x-bar is the mean of the Xi and x-bar is the mean of the Yi.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Previously, we would have called x-bar µ

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but now that we have two variables we're going to use the bar notation.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's go back and look at this formula here.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
When we computed the variance, we would have taken (Xi - X-bar)²

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but here we're taking the product of Xi - X-bar multiplied by the y direction of the same thing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So it's similar to computing a variance. The last thing we do is normalize this thing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Before we often normalize with n but now we're going to normalize with something else.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We normalize with the term that very much reminds us of the variance.
