00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
Now, we already talked about the notion of polynomial running time

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.280
being associated with tractability and exponential running time being associated with intractability

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.650
can lead to some borderline cases where you would probably argue.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:23.350
For example, if you had an algorithm that had polynomial running time of O(n¹⁰)

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:30.460
and you had an exponential running time algorithm with running time 1.01^n,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.130
then actually it would be very hard to decide which one of these algorithms to take.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.850
It would kind of depend on additional information.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.210
What other constant factors here and what is the size of the n.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.260
As I mentioned before, this hardly occurs in practice and this hardly occurs in practice as well.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.650
Tractable problems are usually really tractable

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.760
and intractable problems tend to be intractable in general,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.730
but in later units, we'll actually see how you can deal with exponential running times.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.960
The question we're now dealing with is both for Alice's problem and Bob's problem.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.830
Are they intractable or can we find a polynomial time algorithm

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.390
that would show us that these problems are tractable?

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.570
So far Alice and Bob really don't have a good idea on how to tackle that problem.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.460
That's why they actually decides to get together

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.690
and discuss with each other the problems that they are trying to solve,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.720
and to that meeting, they also invites a friend of theirs,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.840
and that friend of theirs is Carol because as they have learned

00:01:38.840 --> 99:59:59.000
Carol is also working on a problem that so far she has only found an exponential time algorithm for.
