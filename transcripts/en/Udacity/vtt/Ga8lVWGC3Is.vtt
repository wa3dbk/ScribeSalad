00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.880
The conference central application includes both a back-end

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.740
application that defines the end point function and front-end

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.210
application that has the web page users functions. So

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.740
I'm going to call the back-end application, basically I'm going to

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.320
refer to it as the back-end API and the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.800
part of the application that has the web pages

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.240
I'm going to refer to as the web UI.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.620
In our case, they're all in one single application.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.430
Got one app ID, we deploy the app, takes the back-end API and takes web the

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.300
web UI with it. However, the web UI and the back-end API don't have to be in

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.700
the same application. They could be in completely

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.180
separate applications, or you could even have multiple applications,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.045
that provide different front-end interfaces to the conference

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:51.926
back-end API. So here we've got several different applications,

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.219
each with a different kind of Web UI and we

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.179
have our conference API running here on the back-end API. However

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.073
in our case the web UI and the back-end API

00:01:01.073 --> 00:01:04.997
are in the same application. But our opinion doesn't really care

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:07.980
that they're in the same application. You still have to

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.060
authorize a front-end UI to access the back-end API. So, those

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.450
are a few things that you need to do before

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.100
you can start using the web pages in the Conference Central

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.990
application and these are all around authorizing the web UI for

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.180
login and giving the web UI permission to use the back-end API
