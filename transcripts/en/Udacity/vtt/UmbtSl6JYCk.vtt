00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
Here's our first loop. Let's think about what we know--

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.000
"n" is any positive integer and "i" is zero.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What we do know, that "i" is less than "n"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.410
because zero is less than any positive integer.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.550
This loop runs while "i" is less than equal to "n."

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.560
In every iteration, "i" increases by 1.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.190
We know intuitively that eventually "i" will become greater than "n"

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.290
because "n" is fixed.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.830
So, we can say definitively, that this loop always finishes.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.040
Like the previous loop, let's look at what we have.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.310
We have a positive integer-- "n"-- "i"--which starts at 1--

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.940
and here a while true loop.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.780
It will continue forever until we trigger the break.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.180
So, let's look at the inside--

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.390
"i" at every iteration, doubles--

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.690
and "n" at every iteration increases by 1.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.290
The point at which we break is when "i" becomes greater than "n."

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.030
One way to think about "i" is that it is an exponential function.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.330
At every iteration it doubles in size--

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.970
"n" is linear--every iteration increases by 1.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.180
We know "i" starts at 1, but every time it doubles--

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.580
"n," however, can start at any positive integer.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.680
It can be anywhere on here. But we do know, that it increases very slowly.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.390
In fact, it's guaranteed that eventually "i" will surpass "n."

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.690
I will leave the mathematical proof to you, but you can take my word for it for now.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.990
Considering that eventually "i" is going to be greater than "n,"

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.860
we know that we will eventually break.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.200
Which proves that loop 2 always finishes.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.840
So, let's look at this last loop.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.500
It's pretty simple code.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.540
We're given an integer "n," which is any positive integer.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.780
While that integer is not equal to 1-- if it's even--

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.710
we divide by 2, otherwise we multiply by 3 and add 1.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.650
This is pretty simple, however,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.290
in order to figure out whether this loop terminates,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.190
you have to solve an open mathematical problem.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.090
You have to determine whether or not the Collatz conjecture is true.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.400
The Collatz conjecture states that given any positive integer "n"--

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.300
this code will terminate.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.000
It's an open mathematical problem. And no one has solved it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.570
This is just an example of why a really simple loop like this

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.470
is really hard to determine whether or not it terminates.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.240
As mentioned in the lecture,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.210
it's actually impossible for a computer to solve this problem in general.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.210
The correct answer, this is unknown to anyone in the known universe.
