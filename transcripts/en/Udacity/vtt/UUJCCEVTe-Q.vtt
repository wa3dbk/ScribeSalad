00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.430
In the old days, it was commonplace
to save text as a graphic.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.790
As you can see here,
that doesn't scale well visually and

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.020
adds to the page weight and latency.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.980
Text as graphic can also cause
conflicts with format choice.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.180
Now in theory you might
want to save text in a PNG

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.620
format because text has solid color and
hard edges.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.020
But in this example
we've saved as a JPEG

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.980
because we're using text over a photo.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.295
Scale that up, and
you start to see artifacts.

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:36.555
Using text as a graphic also means the
text can't be found by search engines,

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:40.135
and isn't accessible by screen readers
and other assistive technologies.

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:45.151
You can see what the current page looks
like in the text only browser Lynx, that

00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:50.000
gives a good idea of what screen readers
and search engine web crawlers see.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.390
All you can see here is
the alt text on the image,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.050
which says koala and nothing else.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.320
And you can't copy
text as graphic either.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.340
If you do need to incorporate
text in graphics,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.500
overlay real text over the top.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.560
Simple.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.710
Both the photo and the text display and
scale much better, and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.760
you can select the text.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.560
And it's really easy to
add effects with CSS.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.700
I'm using the Lovely Lobster font,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.140
which is one of the many
free web fonts available.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.020
File size is smaller too because we can
save the photo as a nice small JPEG for

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.240
the photo, rather than having
to use PNG to cope with text.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.210
On the subject of text and
images, one way to ensure your

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.350
site is really responsive is
not to have any images at all.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.670
Maybe some of the pages on your
website don't need images.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.750
These sites use beautiful
topography CSS effects and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.980
great layout to achieve really
striking graphical effects,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.310
with responsive layouts and
stonkingly fast load times.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.500
Likewise, these sites,
which use images really sparingly.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.380
When you're designing a responsive site,
every time you add a placeholder for

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.130
an image,
think about whether you really need it.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
Sometimes the best image
is no image at all.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.340
In the past, typography on the web was
extremely limited by the number and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.660
quality of fonts available.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.898
With web fonts and modern CSS
implementations, that's all changed.

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:27.830
Web fonts and CSS enable
beautiful typography on the web

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.560
without having to resort
to using text as graphics.
