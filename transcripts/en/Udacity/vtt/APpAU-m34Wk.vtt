00:00:00.073 --> 00:00:02.952
What are some of the most interesting projects that you've seen done with

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:06.591
CUDA from the beginnings, all the way until today?

00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:12.231
Yeah, you know, one of the great parts about this job is that I continuously learn about fields of

00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:14.784
science and computing that I had no idea existed.

00:00:14.784 --> 00:00:19.088
Whether it be, you know, defense, or oil and gas, or finance.

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:24.503
One of my more favorite projects is the work being done in CT scanners.

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:28.429
A CT scanner is actually--I don't know if you know how this works

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.930
but it's a series of X-rays they take at different angles,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.069
and you're taking 2D X-rays and the machine actually composits

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.933
the X-rays together and were actually, recreates the 3D model of what's going on

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.001
inside your lungs or heart or body or whatever.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:48.128
While it's really cool to get that 3D vision, the bad part actually is the radiation is kind of harmful.

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:52.596
In fact, you want to kind of use the least amount of radiation, but the more x rays

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:55.009
you get the better the view of the problem you have.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:01:00.448
So what this one group is doing is actually, they're using GPUs and they've been able to reduce the

00:01:00.448 --> 00:01:08.874
amount of x-ray radiation by something like 20 X, really making it much safe as a procedure.

00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:11.765
And applying the power of the GPU to take many more

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:17.331
lower-dosage radiation shots, and combine them together to not only get a

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:21.133
clearer picture with less radiation, but you get it really quickly, in one sitting.

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:25.881
You don't have to home and come back to figure out if you have x, y, z problem or issue.

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:29.700
So it's really cool to see that kind of stuff truly affecting lives.
