00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.103
So, we have seen that we want
the cache to be small and fast,

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:07.661
but not too small because then
it keeps very little stuff.

00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:09.590
So, that it has very few hits.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.910
So, what are the cache sizes that
we have actually observed in real

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.170
processors.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.220
There is a complication there,
in that modern processors.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.830
Usually have several
caches not just one.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.380
So depending on which
cache are we talking about

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.040
it might be larger or smaller.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.030
So let's look at caches that we call L1,
or level one caches which are the caches

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.500
that directly service the read and
write requests from the processor.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.850
So when the processor wants to read or

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.239
write, it first goes to the L1
cache to check if it has a hit.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.160
If the L1 cache has a miss, then things
get complicated because before we go to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.470
the main memory, we go to other caches.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.320
And in several lessons,
we will actually see how that works.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.940
But for now, let's just see how
big are these level one caches.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.300
In recent processors,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.180
typical sizes of the L1 cache
have been 16 to 64 kilobytes.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.349
This is large enough to get about
90% hit rate, meaning only one-tenth

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.230
of all the accesses from the processor
end up going beyond this cache.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.102
Yet, these are still small enough to
have the hit time that is equal to

00:01:14.102 --> 00:01:16.840
1 to 3 processor cycles.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.870
So we spend very few
process cycles waiting for

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.890
the data to come back from this cache,
if it's a hit.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.400
Recall that memories have hundreds
of cycles, co this is very,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.710
very fast compared to the memory.
