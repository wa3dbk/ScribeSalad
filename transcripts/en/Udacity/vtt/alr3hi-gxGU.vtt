00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.499
Let's think about what we've learned. Now, we know that a function has the same

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.946
number of zeros, and the some number of linear factors as its degree. And, of

00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:11.154
course, we need to make sure that we count the repeats here. We've also seen

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:15.872
that complex zeros always come in pairs as conjugates. And we know how to find

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:19.400
zeros of all different types. I think it's time then, to work through an

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.212
example that involves multiple techniques we've learned. This is going to be a

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:26.592
great problem to help you summarize all the important aspects of determining

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:31.736
zeros. So, get ready for this amazing polynomial function. We have f of x

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:37.208
equals, we're off to a pretty good start. 2x to the fourth, minus 13x cubed,

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:44.525
plus 32x squared, minus 13x, and that's it. I hope you're impressed. So, if we

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:47.738
want to find the zeros of this function, how do you think the best way to start

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:51.976
would be? Should we factor the first two terms and then factor the last two

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:55.501
terms? Should we grab a snack, since it's going to be a long ride? Should we

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.838
pull out the greatest common factor from all of the terms? Should we use the

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:04.816
rational zero theorem involving negative 13 and 2? Should we divide both sides

00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:07.233
by x? Or should we combine like terms?
