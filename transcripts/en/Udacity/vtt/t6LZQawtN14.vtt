00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.390
You just a created a look up relationship. You already

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.980
created a master detail relationship before. What's the difference? In a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.830
master detail, the child record needs to have a parent. It

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.720
wouldn't make sense to have an attendee without a festival. If

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.270
we were to think about the relationship between attendees and festivals,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.120
we could delete an attendee and the festival would be fine.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.350
But if we deleted a festival, all of the attendees would

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.940
have to go away too. And that's called a cascade delete.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.140
Look up relationships don't have cascade deletes. So if we

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.650
were to delete a stage, we wouldn't necessarily want to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.490
get rid of all those bands, because those bands are

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.390
still around and they could play at a different stage.
