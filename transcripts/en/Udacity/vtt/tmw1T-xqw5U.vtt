[SOUND].

00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:07.490
So I want you to think about the first few minutes or seconds. When you're

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.060
interacting with a product for the first

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.110
time. What do you typically do? You might

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.120
play with it, look for directions. I

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.620
don't know. You might even smell it. Basically,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.050
you're figuring out how to use it. And

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.680
what supports that process? Well, signifiers and affordances.
