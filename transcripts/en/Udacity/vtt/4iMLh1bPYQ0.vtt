00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.319
So people diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, are characterized

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.584
by an overly inflated sense of self, a very positive view of themselves. All

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:14.013
their attention is self focused. Like the world kind of revolves around them.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:17.795
and because of this they really do disregard the needs of other people, and

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:23.576
make really strong demands on other people. Now, they appear to be very

00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:28.394
confident but this confidence is very fragile and vulnerable. They get really,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:32.784
really upset when other people criticize them. And, in fact, also the

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:37.005
relationships, having a relationship with someone with this disorder is very,

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:41.510
very difficult and trying because it's all about them.
