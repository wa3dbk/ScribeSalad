00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.580
Let's analyze some of the benefits
of coded aperture here.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.970
Basically, we looked at
variety of different you know,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.630
types of kernels here, larger scale,
correct scale, and a smaller scale.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.670
And, of course, we have the coded
apertures, of course, also scaled down.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.001
If you had an image like this to be
reconstructed on a conventional the,

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.724
again, Lucy Richardson types
of deconvolution method,

00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:23.072
you'd get a lot of ringing.

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:26.200
Of course, if we do it at the correct
scale so the size of the kernel matches

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.230
the kind of signal that's in the
original image, you'll do much better.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.760
But of course,
if you do it a smaller scale,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.340
you actually will add
other forms of blur.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.110
Of course,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.510
the secret is to figure out which of
these scales to do this kind of stuff.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.890
We've looked at that concept, and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.015
we looked all the frequency,
domain, fading, and blending stuff.

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.290
But in case of coded,
of course we have an artifact

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.810
that we might actually generate
something like this, but

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.050
we actually do get a much better
image at the right scale.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.670
And of course,
a little bit of blurriness and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.450
ringing at the scale that's smaller.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.830
I do loo, encourage you to look at the
Levinthal paper, that'll gives you more

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.569
detail about this kind of stuff and
how to choose the right scale.
