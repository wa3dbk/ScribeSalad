00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Another implication is that you should not use assertions to check for public preconditions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that is, conditions that your program must check anyway

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to ensure the integrity of data coming from third parties.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
As an example, if you have, say website or device, myaccount.com,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where users can enter arbitrary amounts of data to be processed

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
then do not use an assertion to check for the integrity of this data

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
instead use a check that is not optional and will always remain active.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, in our example over here, here's something that you should not write.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So here, we get an input, convert this into an integer, store this in deposit,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and then we use an assert to check this external data

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to make sure the deposit is greater or equal than 0.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
As soon as I turned the assertion off, this check will no longer be performed,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and therefore, it would be possible, say, to enter negative deposit numbers.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What you should do instead is just a regular check.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you do have some invalid data in here that comes from a third party, raise an exception,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
abort execution, pop up an error message

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
or do whatever is most appropriate for the situation.
