00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.910
So, we made these three histograms, and let's take a

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.770
closer look at them. We have one for females, one

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.860
for males, and one for NA. NA stands for Not

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.570
Applicable. And the third histogram we just created contains users who

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.570
are not labeled as male or female. This is how

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.980
R handles missing values. Missing values take on a value

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.420
of NA. Let's try creating our histogram for friend counts

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.680
split by gender one more time. But this time we'll take

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.300
a subset of our data and ignore the observations where the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.810
gender is an a. To do that, I'm going to subset our data.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.940
I can use the Subset command. And use a condition for the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.570
second parameter. The first parameter is just the data set. Here I'm

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.830
using the is dot NA function with a bang. This removes

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.870
any rows that have NA for the gender variable. So if I

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.170
run this code this time I shouldn't see the NA and fixing

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.490
a small typo I can see I have my two histograms for

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.160
females and males. Now I do want to point out there's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.470
another way that we could have subset the data. If,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.210
instead, I use the na.omit function, I would remove any

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.110
observations that have NA in them, not necessarily just for gender.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.160
You want to be careful when using the na.omit wrapper since

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.370
we might end up ignoring some users that are labeled as

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.210
male or female But, they might have different variables that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.060
do have NA values. Say for like friend_count or something else.
