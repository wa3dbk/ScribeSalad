00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.333
The all go through the point 1,0, as we can see right here. Each of them has

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:08.452
the same x intercept. It doesn't matter what base we use, whether it's 2, 4,

00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:15.822
10, e, or any other number. We will always have log of 1 equals zero. And that

00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:21.470
gives us the point, 1,0. This corresponds to the point 0,1 on the exponential

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.670
function graph, since as we saw before, a to the 0 is always equal to 1

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.435
regardless of what a is, unless it's 0, since 0 to the 0 is not defined. Just a

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:38.650
note, whenever the base is e, we don't usually write log base e. Instead, we

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.270
usually write the letters ln. You should have a button that says this on your

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.409
calculator.
