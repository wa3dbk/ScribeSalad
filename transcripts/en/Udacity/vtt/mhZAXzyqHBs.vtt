00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.860
Let's summarize this lesson. Chi-Square tests can check for how well observed

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.440
values fit the expected values for categorical data. In this case we have some

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.700
variable that's categorical, and there are different responses for that

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.550
variable. In our first example when we were helping Professor Rogers decide

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.177
whether or not he should hire that guide mountaineering company. The variables

00:00:24.177 --> 00:00:29.680
was success. Our responses were successful versus unsuccessful. In that case

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.690
there were just two responses. But there can be as many as we need for a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.250
particular categorical variable. And in the case of goodness of fit, our

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.520
expected values are what we guess for our null hypothesis. However in the case

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.330
of independents our expected values are based on the results of our marginal

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.725
totals. let's just assign some random numbers here. We have an m by n

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:59.395
contingency table and let's say the total number of subjects in the sample was

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:07.460
100. We would expect that 15 out of 100 of our subjects would have response 1,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.216
of variable 2. Therefore, we would expect that same proportion to have response

00:01:14.216 --> 00:01:20.690
1 of variable 1. If there were 30 total in response 1 of variable 1, then we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.680
would expect 15 out of 100 times 30, for this cell. And here is what we would

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.450
expect for the other cells. If it's easier for you to remember, the expected

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.630
values are the column totals times the row totals, divided by the total total.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.820
And then for both goodness of fit and independence chi squared tests. We

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.920
calculate the chi squared statistic by taking the sum of each squared

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.430
difference between the observed and expected values divided by the expected

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.500
value. Then we can use the chi squared table to determine if our results are

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.720
statistically significant. That's if we're doing it by hand, but usually we'll

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.880
use software, and the important part, is you know how to interpret our results.
