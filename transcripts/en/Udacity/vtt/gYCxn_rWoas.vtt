00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.831
Now the answer is that it actually does do something.

00:00:02.831 --> 00:00:04.814
It produces an output.

00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:08.492
If it takes numbers as inputs then it produces their sum.

00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:12.000
But it works also if we pass in strings.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.354
It would produce the concatenation of the 2 strings,

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:15.969
because the "+" operator

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.000
works on both strings and numbers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Given the name sum, it makes more sense to use it to add numbers,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but it will work perfectly well using strings as well.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And let me just show you that in the Python interpreter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So now, I changed sum to return the value of a.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.338
I have 2 variables that are strings.

00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:41.000
We've introduced s to 'Hello ' with a space at the end and t to 'Dave!'

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now I'm calling sum, passing in s and t,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and what I get as a result is Hello Dave!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Note that it does not change the value of s.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
s is passed into the first input.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.291
Even though we change the value of a here,

00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:57.568
that does not change the value of s.
