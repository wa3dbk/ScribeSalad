00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.230
Let's apply this idea of the degrees of freedom to samples and populations.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.607
Let's say these are values in a population. We can pick any n values from this

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:15.153
population to have the sample of size n. If n is five, let's say we pick these

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:20.580
five. There are five degrees of freedom. If we pick a sample of size n, we have

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.353
n degrees of freedom. But then we have to calculate the sample standard

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:30.732
deviation. And to do this, we need the sample mean. To find the mean, we add up

00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:36.240
each value in our sample, divide by the number in our sample, and then we get x

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.430
bar. That means that the sum of all the values in the sample has to be x bar

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.966
times n, this is just like that example you did before where you have n values

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:54.151
that must add to 10. In that case, you had n minus 1 degrees of freedom and the

00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:59.771
same applies here. In our population, when we need to pick a sample of size n,

00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:04.102
we now have a restriction that nth value has to ensure that they add to x bar

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:10.550
times n. In other words, n minus 1 of the values may vary as long as the nth

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.712
value results in that same sum to get the same average. N minus one is called

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:22.361
the effective sample size. Since the sample standard deviation depends on x

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:27.530
bar, there are n minus 1 degrees of freedom. You might ask, well why do we

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.530
divide by n with the population standard deviation if that also uses x bar?

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.365
Well, with the population we can't replace certain values with other values,

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:40.820
like we can with samples, because we already have all possible values of the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.894
population. Degrees of freedom are the number of pieces of information that can

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:51.354
be freely varied without violating any given restrictions. Think of degrees of

00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:54.953
freedom as the number of independent pieces of information available to

00:01:54.953 --> 00:02:00.601
estimate another piece of information. Only n minus 1 values are independent

00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:05.936
after we know the mean. As the degrees of freedom increases, the t-distribution

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:09.193
better approximates the normal distribution.
