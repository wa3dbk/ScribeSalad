00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.970
So let's recap the code we have at the end

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.590
of unit two. So we defined a procedure, get_next_target, that

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.050
would take a page, search for the first linked target

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.310
on that page, return that as the value of URL.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.470
That would be the first output, and also return the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.600
position where the end of the quote is so we

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.580
know how to continue. And then we define the procedure

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.680
print all_links that keeps going as long as we can.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.560
As long as there are more URLs on the page. It

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
will find the next target. Store these in the variables URL and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.580
endpos to keep track of the location end of string. If

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.620
there is a URL, what we did was just print it out

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.990
and then we update with the page to keep going. What

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.100
we want to do to change this is instead of just printing out

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.350
each URL as we find it, we want to collect the URLs. We

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.090
want to have a way to use the URLs so we can use

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.110
them to keep crawling to find new

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.040
pages. The structure we've been learning about this

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.270
unit is the way to do that. What we want to do is keep all the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.780
URLs in a list. At the end of this procedure, instead of printing the links

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.700
as we go, we want to have a list of all the links that we found.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.690
So this is what the current print_all_links procedure does.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.900
It takes the page as its input and its output

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.950
is nothing. It doesn't return anything. All it does

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.720
is do some work, prints out all these links. But

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.560
we can't actually use them at the end, because

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.990
it doesn't return anything. So what we want to do is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.228
change this. Instead of print_all_links, what we want is to

00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:35.280
get_all_links. We want to actually have the links in a way

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.890
that we can use them. So what we want,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.720
instead of printing all links is to actually get the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390
links. So we'll change the name of our procedure

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.400
to get_all_links. And instead of outputting none, what we want to

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.190
do is output a list of links. And that

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.340
should be the list that corresponds to the things that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.640
we were printing before, but now instead of just

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.070
printing them, we want to output them as a list.
