00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.610
For this style we will organize the components into layers.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.610
For the higher level components register their interest in lower level events

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.760
and are then called back when the events occur.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.030
In particular, the upper level components don't know the identity of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.800
the lower level components providing the events.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.660
The lower layers are going to handle the external events

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.790
propagating status changes upward.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.240
So when the user moves the handle, that particular event ultimately has to

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.710
be handled so that the user sees something different.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.290
So the event has to be propagated to higher layers into the architecture.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.842
Which then handle it to, to affect all those indirect

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:45.060
indirect implications of, of the requirements of the system.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.420
Well, I should say that the upper layers receive these notifications and

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.370
they prepare and present the results.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.840
This propagation of events is implicit, so we call it implicit invocation.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.570
Event announcement is made without the source component knowing the recipient

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.510
which is, which reduces the coupling between all the components.
