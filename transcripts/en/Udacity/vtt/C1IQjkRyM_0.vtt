00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.640
So this example,
this robot that's going down the hall,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.689
it's got this noise sensor, this is
perfect for sort of a probabilistic

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.712
Bayesian filter based tracker, and
the reason is, first of all, it's

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:15.870
going to have some continuous belief
about where it thinks it might be.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.670
Right?
So that's its belief, it's distribution,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.290
it's posterior about where it thinks,
and it's measurements are noisy, and

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.450
furthermore, it's really unlikely
that depending upon those

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.270
measurements that it will have a nice
Gaussian belief about where things are.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.049
It's belief is going to
be whatever it is.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.900
So we're going to make make use
of a particle filter to do this.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.720
All right?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.230
What you're seeing here,
is this is the prior density.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.610
So here's our little,
should we name our robot?

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.780
Sure, what's a good name see, I would
use some like R2D2 kind of name but

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.620
then I would get sued by George Lucas.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.520
So we'll call it R3D3.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.666
Okay, so R3D3 is sitting over here and
this here,

00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:01.240
this is his prior belief
about where it is right now.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.093
We have no idea how it got that value,
this is it's random distribution, and

00:01:05.093 --> 00:01:08.710
you can see it's a pretty uniform
distribution of particles.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.244
Now the sensor reaches out and
it gets the measurement and

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:16.260
let's just suppose it sticks its
stick out and it sees a hole.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.750
What that means is,
the stick doesn't run into anything, so

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.530
it says, it's a hole.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.210
Now using the sensor model,
the robot has to evaluate

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.830
not where it thinks it is but
first, what's the probability that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.255
I would see a hole if I was
at each of these locations?

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:39.580
So,after the robot sees the hole,
what it has to evaluate is

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.570
what is the likelihood that I would've
seen a hole, if I was at this location?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.400
So these values here, these are not the
probability that I'm at that location,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.790
given that I saw a hole, it's
the probability that I would see a hole,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.780
given that I was at that location.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.270
So the reason that it's
highest in the middle

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.150
is because even if I've got a wiggly
stick over here, the likelihood

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.220
that I see a hole is higher than if I'm
sort of at the edge of the hole, right,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.460
because then I might sometimes run into
the wall, sometimes run into the hole,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.980
and that's why I have this nice
tight little distribution like that.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.550
Okay?

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.000
So remember,
that's not p of x given the hole,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.590
it's the probability that I would
see a hole given that I was an x.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.750
Then what do we do?

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.180
Well, in a particle filter
we just multiply p of z,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.850
given x, probability the hole given x,
times my prior distribution for

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.780
everyone of these xs, okay?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.740
So that's what this
distribution is down here,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.230
that is the multiplication of
the prior times the likelihood,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.790
and in math, remember, the belief is
proportional to the prediction, or

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.480
my belief prior, that's this here, times
my likelihood, that's this value here,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.370
and then I have to normalize the whole
thing in order to get a new belief.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.790
Okay, that's why I'm doing that.
