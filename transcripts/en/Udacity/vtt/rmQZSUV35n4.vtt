00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.370
Thanks, Amir.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.200
Let's drill down into different types
of ideas that you could dream up.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.290
The first type of idea
is a simplify idea.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.080
With these types of ideas,
you're trying to make a process or

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.400
a task much easier for your user.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.330
Instagram did this by simplifying
the process for combining images.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.190
They have an app called Layout,
which allows you to combine photos from

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.500
your camera phone into
customized layouts.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.470
Another type of an idea
is a me too idea.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.710
It's where you take a current idea and
you bring it to a new market.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.860
Flipkart is a me too idea.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.280
Similar to Amazon, the company
leveraged market insights in India

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.920
to pioneer concepts such
as cash on delivery.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.232
Flipkart also partnered with other
companies to provide exclusive sales on

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:45.867
its website, since it had such
a deep understanding of India and

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:47.026
its user's needs.

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.418
Virtualize is another type of idea.

00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:52.645
It involves moving an activity
to the online space.

00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:54.380
Need to do your taxes?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.020
TurboTax allows you to send off
your tax forms electronically.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.590
You can even do them from
your mobile phone or tablet.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.720
Need to hail a cab?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.269
Lyft makes this process
also really seamless.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.720
You can do it right
from your mobile phone.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.000
For this type of idea, it's important
to think about how you can leverage

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.860
existing technologies or
build upon new technologies.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.290
For example, Lyft used the fact
that everyone had cell phones and

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.700
GPS locations to provide cab
service to people on demand.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.990
You might also try to remix or
combine two or more ideas.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.490
Slack, an online messaging tool,
is one great example of a remix idea.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.290
Slack is a team communication tool
that streamlines email, chat and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.300
private group messaging while
making all content searchable.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.840
I can chat at my fellow course
developers or I can put in an order for

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.510
some late night food.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.050
Finally, there are types of
ideas that seem impossible.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.850
Or almost impossible.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.830
These types of ideas are just
like Google's project Loon.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.190
Project Loon attempts to bring
internet to the rural and

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.670
remote areas of the world
using helium balloons.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.560
In the next few exercises, you'll
look at some different companies and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.880
determine which types
of ideas apply to them.
