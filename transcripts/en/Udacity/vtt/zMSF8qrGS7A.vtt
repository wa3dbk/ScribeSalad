00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Norvig] So here's my solution. You can look at the code.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I think it's pretty self-explanatory, so I won't go through all the details.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll just mention a few things.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First of all, notice that it's returning a tuple consisting of the major rank

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then the tiebreakers, and it just goes through them all in order--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And then the interesting part is, 1, how do you determine what major rank it is?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So we test to see if it's a straight flush. Then it's number 8. That's a straight flush.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Another example: If you have 3 of a kind and you also have 2 of a kind,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
then that's a full house, which is number 6.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And then what are the tiebreakers?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They're the important cards first that are part of the thing.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So with a full house the most important tiebreaker is the 3 of a kind,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and then the next most important is the 2 of a kind,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we pick out what each one is, put them in that return value to break the ties.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And a final thing I'll note is that card_ranks is defined to return the ranks in sorted order.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so that, for example, when you have nothing, just returning the ranks,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that means that the highest card is first and that's going to be the first tiebreaker,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the next highest card is second and that's the next tiebreaker and so on.

00:01:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And that's all you need to know.
