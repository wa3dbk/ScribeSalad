00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:06.360
The hypotenuse is 25, the longer leg is 20, and the shorter leg is 15 units.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.059
Great work for finding those three numbers. For a squared we'll have x minus 5

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.151
squared, for b squared we'll have x squared and for c squared we'll have the

00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:21.525
quantity x plus 5 squared. Keep in mind a and b are the legs, and c is our

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:26.104
hypotenuse. Now we have one equation with one variable, which means we can

00:00:26.104 --> 00:00:31.392
solve. Squaring the quantity x minus 5, we get x squared minus 10x plus 25, and

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:37.702
squaring the quantity x plus 5 squared, we get x squared plus 10x plus 25. This

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:42.163
x squared just comes straight down here. Next, we'll add like terms on the left

00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:47.922
hand side of our equation to get 2x squared minus 10x plus 25. The right hand

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:51.738
side of our equation stays the same. And since we have a quadratic equation, we

00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:54.987
want to move all of these terms to the left hand side so that we can get a

00:00:54.987 --> 00:01:00.480
quadratic expression set equal to 0. We move each of these terms to the other

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.634
side of the equation by subtracting the appropriate amount. We'll subtract x

00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:11.126
squared, subtract 10x, and subtract 25 from both sides of the equation. We do

00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:15.720
this so that with the x squared term remains positive, and then we can factor.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.928
This leaves us with x squared minus 20x equals 0. We can factor an x from these

00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:27.264
two terms since it is the greatest common factor. So, of x times the quantity x

00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:34.680
minus 20. We set each factor equal to 0. And then we solve for x. X can equal 0

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.191
or x can equal positive 20. Since we know we're talking about the side length

00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:46.126
the longer leg must be 20. The 0 doesn't make sense in this case. So our longer

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:51.946
leg will be 20, our hypotenuse will be 5 more which is 25. And our shorter leg

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:54.711
will be five less which is 15.
