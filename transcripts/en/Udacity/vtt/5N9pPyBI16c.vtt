00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.083
You might be wondering why this might be useful. Never fear.

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:05.691
We'll have 2 good examples in this unit

00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:08.358
and cover the first one here and the second a little later.

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:12.896
So let's consider the problem of sparse matrix/dense vector multiplication,

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:17.713
which we abbreviate SpMv, sparse matrix vector.

00:00:17.713 --> 00:00:21.931
Many interesting matrices have lots of zeroes, so we call those matrices sparse.

00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:26.411
And we want to find a data structure to represent them that squeezes out the zeroes

00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:31.202
as well as to find a more efficient way to multiply them by vectors.

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:35.950
After all, if there's lots of zeroes, we'll do lots of multiplications that have no effect.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.520
So sparse matrices are incredibly common in computational problems in many domains.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.040
For instance, PageRank is the world's largest matrix computation.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.400
PageRank is based on a giant sparse matrix that represents every web page in the world.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.466
How big is this matrix?

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:57.067
Well if there is n web pages in the world, this matrix is n by n

00:00:57.067 --> 00:01:05.117
and each entry at row R in column C is non-zero only if web page R Links to web page C.

00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:07.937
So the PageRank computation on this sparse matrix

00:01:07.937 --> 00:01:11.344
is how Google computes the importance of web pages.

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:15.587
Let's briefly refresh how we multiply a matrix by a vector.

00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:19.230
Students who already know this are welcome to skip to the next segment.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.096
So we're going to multiply this 3x3 matrix here by this 3x1 matrix here. So how do we do this?

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:29.005
For each output in the output vector,

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:36.077
we multiply the row of the input matrix by the column of the input vector.

00:01:36.077 --> 00:01:38.609
So we do this in a pairwise way--

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.668
a times x + b times y + c times z,

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:46.752
and that will create the entry here ax + by + cz.

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:52.482
For each additional row in the output matrix we simply do another one of these dot products.

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:59.136
So for instance, to compute this value here we dot product this vector with, again,

00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:05.102
our input vector to get g times x + h times y + i times z.

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:07.571
So let's do a matrix times a vector as a quiz.

00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:11.383
We're going to have this sample 3 x3 matrix times this sample 3x3 vector.

00:02:11.383 --> 00:02:15.388
And I'd like you to write the vector answer in these 3 blanks here.
