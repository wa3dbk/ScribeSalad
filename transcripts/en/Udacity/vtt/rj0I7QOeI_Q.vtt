00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.696
Okay, so let's do now an active power quiz. Suppose we have a processor whose

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:09.468
voltage can be changed between 0.9 and 1.5

00:00:09.468 --> 00:00:13.600
volts in 0.1 volt steps. Its frequency can

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.740
be changed between 1.8 gigahertz and 3 gigahertz

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.880
in 0.2 gigahertz steps. But there is a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.270
relationship between the voltage and the frequency you

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.310
have to use. If we want to use

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.138
the lowest frequency setting, our voltage can be 0.9 volts. If we want to use

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:37.457
the next frequency setting of 2.0 gigahertz, then the voltage needs to be 1.0

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:44.688
volts. For 2.2 gigahertz, we need to use 1.1 volts and so on. And

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:52.000
we can only get the highest 3 gigahertz with the highest voltage of 0.1 volts.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.352
So, we can not just lower the voltage and increase

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:57.068
the frequency. If you increase the frequency, you also have

00:00:57.068 --> 00:01:00.195
to increase the voltage. Of course, you are allowed to

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:03.968
use a 2 gigahertz frequency setting with any voltage that

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:07.034
is 1.0 volts or above. So we could, for example,

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:10.282
do 2 gigahertz and 1.5 volts, although that's, of course,

00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:12.892
going to be less power efficient than using the lowest

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:17.196
voltage available for that frequency. Let's say also that we have

00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:19.716
measured the power consumption at 1 volt

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:22.480
and 2 gigahertz, this setting here. And we

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.256
have found that the processor consumes 30

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:26.878
watts of power. The questions for you are,

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.462
what is the power for the most

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:32.700
power-efficient setting among these? Put your answer here.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.675
And what is the power for the

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:38.310
highest-performance setting among these? Put your answer here.
