00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.550
Here's a very simple app that
has a map embedded within it.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.610
It doesn't have visual controls along
the map that allow me to do things such

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.950
as zoom in and out.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.520
But I can actually pinch
the map if I want to zoom.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.500
Here you can see I'm zooming in, and
here you can see I'm zooming out.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.390
It also has data such as country names,
you can see here the United States

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.010
country name as well as the states
in the United States and cities.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.660
And also here we can see
Mexico is a country name.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.010
So a lot of the data is already
available on this map for me and

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.910
I'll show shortly how I built this and
it was very, very simple,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.910
very straightforward, and effectively
getting all of this data for free.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.400
If I zoom in on a specific location,
like right now I'm going to zoom in

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.320
on the Silicon Valley area, and
we begin to see town names.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.520
And if I get in even closer
we'll begin to see street names.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.980
Here you can see West El Camino Real.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.300
We can see Latham Street.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.850
This is right here where I'm recording,
and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.750
if I zoom even closer we'll begin
to see individual buildings.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.520
And here we can see buildings appearing.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000
Across the road from
here is a shopping mall.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.760
And, actually some building when,
I zoom right into them,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.180
I begin to see some of the details
of the interior of the building.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.090
So here we can see I have a department
store very close to me, and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.780
I'm beginning to see the sections within
the department store Including the fact

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.830
that they put the bakery right
beside the intimate apparel.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.870
Now, all of this data came with the maps
without me having to write anything.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.090
I just added the map to an Android
app with a default customization.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.020
It's very, very simple to do.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.820
And in the next few minutes, you're
actually going to build this exact app,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.850
and it will give you the foundation for
building much more complex and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.730
interesting mapping apps
later in this course.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.490
So let's get started.
