Here's how I would fix the constructor. aNme would change to name, xCoord would

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:09.621
change to just x, yCoord would change to just y. I have to change aName here,

00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:15.384
xCoord and yCoord. And now I need to make sure to write this.name equals name,

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:21.790
this.x as x and this.y as y. I compiled and got no syntax errors. And when I

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.833
run the program like I did before, the picture still looks fine.
