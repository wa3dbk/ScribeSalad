00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.260
So if we just plug in our values into Chebyshev's inequality,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.880
we see that x bar should deviate from the true beta star by no more than 0.01,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.730
and the probability of it doing that should be less than or equal to .1.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.110
So if you solve this for n, you get 25,000.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.680
Now this is troubling because we only have about 3,200 points.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.590
So what can we say with 3,200 points?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.920
Well, if all the other parameters are the same.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.790
And we just replace n with 3,200.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.656
The probability that deviation from the true data star is greater than 0.01,

00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:36.590
is 0.78 which is pretty high.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.190
However, we can decrease this probability to a more manageable 5%,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.460
if we drop our accuracy bound from 0.01 to 0.0395.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.540
So, just to summarize what we found out.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.402
For our 3,200 data points, if we accept a deviation from the true beta star

00:00:54.402 --> 00:01:00.719
of .0395, we can be sure we'll deviate from it with a probability of 5% or less
