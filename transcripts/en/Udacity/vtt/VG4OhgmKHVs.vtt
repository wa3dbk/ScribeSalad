Alright. So now we know how to parseJSON data. How do we actually retrieve that

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:13.446
from our server? This is where XMLHttPRequest come in. An XMLHttpRequest allows

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:19.875
our Javascript code running in a browser to fire a request off to our server to

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:26.060
a specific URL. We can also specify a function call once the server responds to

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:32.078
our request. Now, there are a few steps to this. First, we need to create a new

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.006
XMLHttpRequest object, and we do this using the new keyword, followed by

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:45.500
XMLHttpRequest with the parentheses. Now, note that case is sensitive here.

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:52.261
Next, we need to call the XMLHttpRequest open method. First, we need to specify

00:00:52.273 --> 00:00:58.396
the HTTP method to use. In our cases, we're pretty much always going to want to

00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:03.532
use GET. Second, we specify the URL to call out to. For example, if we were

00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:09.200
requesting a JSON file, we would specify the file name that we were interested

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:14.620
in. Finally, we specify a Boolean value that is set to true if we want the call

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:19.806
to be asynchronous. We pretty much always want the call to be asynchronous.

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:25.482
Next, we specify the onload parameter, which is a function that we define that

00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:31.010
gets called once the server responds to our request. Finally, we need to call

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:36.782
the xhr.send method. This will actually kick-off the request. Note that we need

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:42.446
to do all of these things first, before we can call send. Otherwise, the request

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:47.850
might hit the server and respond before we can specify our onload function. And

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:52.650
if that happens, we won't actually know what to do with the response yet.
