00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.190
So we've talked about visual cues to encode and represent

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.360
your data. Another thing we consider is the different types

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.062
of data that are available. Most data can be categorized

00:00:10.062 --> 00:00:13.660
into 3 basic types. In fact, we've seen all 3

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.320
types of this data during our walk through of the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.330
baseball data without explicitly referring to them as such. The

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.690
first of these types is numeric data. Numeric data as

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.530
you might expect, is any data where our data points

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.180
are exact numbers. These data have meaning as

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.730
a measurement such as a baseball player's height

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.260
or weight or as a count, such as number of hits or home runs for a player

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.490
or how many players there are on a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.160
team. Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.030
Numerical data can be characterized into discrete or

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.750
continuous data. Discrete data has distinct values whereas continuous

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.450
data can assume any value within a range. For

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.890
example, a player's number of home runs would be

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.830
a discrete data set. You can only have discrete

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.504
whole number values like 10, 25, or 34. A

00:01:01.504 --> 00:01:07.390
player cannot for example, hit 14.375 home runs. A

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.640
player either hits a home run or he doesn't.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.910
On the other hand, continuous data are numbers that

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.822
can fall anywhere within a range. Like a player's

00:01:15.822 --> 00:01:19.480
batting average which falls between 0 and 1000. So

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.440
a player could have a batting average of 0.250, they

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.442
could also have a batting average of 0.357 or

00:01:25.442 --> 00:01:30.050
0.511. And so again just to hammer this home, examples

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.960
of numeric data might be a baseball player's height

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.470
or weight or their number of home runs or a

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.040
number of hits or a number of doubles. The

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.910
take away here is that this is data that are

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.540
numbers and they are not ordered in

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.470
time. They're just numbers that we've collected.
