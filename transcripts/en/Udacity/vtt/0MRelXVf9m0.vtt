00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.380
So far, the issues that we've been talking about have been mostly system issues,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.940
things like reliability. I'd also like to spend a moment talking about

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
software engineering side of things, that is building these systems.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.000
First category of issue has to do with requirements. Because non-functional

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.610
requirements dominate this sort of situation, the requirements analyst has to

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.610
elicit this information from the customers. And of course, it's axiomatic that

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.070
the customers aren't always sure of what the requirements should be,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.150
particularly with respect to quality of service. That is, some kind of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.465
measured understanding of how the system is going to deal with these

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:48.030
non-functional situations. Second concern of software architecture. Recall,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.020
I've been stressing throughout the course that the key element of coming up with

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.760
a good solution architecturally is how it's going to deal with a non functional

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.230
requirements, a corollary to that is in coming up with the architecture and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.390
choosing the connectors how do those connectors relate to a middleware solutions

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.650
that we have. Can, for example, define an appropriate middleware technology for

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.350
dealing with one of the connections we've selected to be included in

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.380
the architecture. Third software engineering issue has to do with some design

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.590
questions. Whenever you have a distributed application you have a network.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.730
Whenever you have a network you have latency. That is delays in message passing.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.610
How is your system going to deal at the software level with this latency.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.540
Are there timeouts, are there the implementation of some kind of protocol for

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.720
resending, and so on. Another key question at the design level

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.420
as far as distributed applications are concerned is statefulness.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.910
You know that the web applications often are stateless.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.420
That is, every time you interact with the server,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.410
the server has to treat your interaction as a self-contained unit without

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.410
relying on any variables retaining values. Of course the database sitting there

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.418
can serve as a persistent but heavyweight way of keeping track of state.

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:18.070
The question from the designer then is how they're going to deal with this.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.090
One solution is, you've seen probably with respect to cookies,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.360
that is the server sends back some of its state to the client,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.790
which then returns that information on the next next interaction. And then

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.330
there's just the general question of concurrency. How is synchronization going

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.250
to be performed, how can you ensure you don't run into any of the problems like

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.370
dead like, dead lock or making sure that everyone of the pieces of the system

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.840
has some kind of interaction on a timely basis that is, that it's live
