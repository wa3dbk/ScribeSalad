00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.130
Now let's briefly consider just what happens to load and store instructions.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.910
Just like we had data dependencies that go through registers, this is for

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.950
example, why we did register remaining to eliminate the false dependencies

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.750
through registers and why we are doing these reservation stations and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.070
so on in order to kind of obey properly the true dependencies. There can be

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.570
dependencies through memory. Because loads and stores, in this case,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.160
are the only instructions that can have dependencies through memory, but

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.390
there can be dependencies. A read after write dependence occurs, if there is for

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.830
example a stored word, to some address in memory.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.160
And then we do a load word from that address.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.800
Then there is definitely a read after write dependence between the store and

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.050
the load. Basically the load uses the value put there by the store.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.150
We can also have a write after read false dependence. For example,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.660
we can have the program that first needs to load something then store it.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.010
If we reorder this, then the load gets a value from the store,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.350
not the value from before. And finally we can have a write after I dependency.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.040
There are two stores. The store to the same address. The last one should,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.610
can, leave the value at the end of that sequence. But

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.270
if we reorder them then the value in the memory ends up being the, kind of,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.060
stale value from the first of the stores. So, obviously, dependencies from

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.710
memory need to be obeyed or eliminate it just like register ones do.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.370
So what do we do about the dependencies? In Tomasulo's algorithm,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.010
we do loads and stores in order; basically we don't try to reorder them.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.750
When as we should these instructions, we put them load and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.930
store queue and then we just follow the order of this instruction. So for

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.790
example, a load doesn't execute if there is a previous store pending

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.210
even though maybe the load is ready to go but the store still is waiting for

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.760
something. The second option is to actually identify dependency between load

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.232
stores, et cetera, and then reorder them just like we did normal instructions,

00:01:54.232 --> 00:01:59.335
et cetera. But this turns out to be more complicated than doing it for

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:02.765
register-based dependencies, so we are not going to do that. And that's why for

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:06.070
Tomasulo's algorithm they chose not to do this for memory instructions, but

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.419
they chose to do, do it for other instructions. Modern processors actually do

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.410
identify dependencies, reorder, et cetera, even for loads and stores.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.864
But we will consider later how that is done. So, so for Tomasulo's algorithm,

00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:21.349
this was really kind of the, you know, option that they chose.
