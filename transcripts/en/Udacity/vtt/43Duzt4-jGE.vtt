9.0 minus 7.9 is 1.1. We still need an equal sign of course. And on the other

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:10.142
side of the equation, we still keep our log base 10 of J, since nothing down

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:16.222
here has cancelled that out. And we're subtracting log based 10 of C. Now, we

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:22.196
have minus log based 10 of S here, and we're actually adding one down here. So,

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:26.633
those two cancel out and this is all we're left with.
