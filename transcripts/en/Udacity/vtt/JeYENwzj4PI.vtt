00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.070
So we have observed that when

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.570
the cache that we use as the L2 cache is
used alone, it has a higher hit rate.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.910
Let's look back at our example.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.680
Here, where we see that 128kB cache,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.749
when used alone,
will have a relatively high hit rate.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.190
But when we use it after the level
1 cache has already been accessed,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.160
it only gets a 75% hit rate.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.960
So it looks like the L2
cache has a lower

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.830
hit rate than the L1 cache,
which can be misleading.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:43.860
So this particular type of hit rate we
call local hit rate for this cache.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.810
A local hit rate is a hit rate
that the cache actually observes.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.550
Of all the accesses to that cache,
this many are hits.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.826
But note that all the accesses
to a level 2, level 3,

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:03.270
etc., cache, are not all the accesses
that the processor makes.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.140
Those accesses that have a lot of
locality get to be all one hit,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.910
and never reach these caches.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.780
So, somehow,
their local hit rate is lower

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.170
because they never see
the easy accesses.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.650
If such a cache was alone, it would see
this, which we call a global hit rate.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.880
Essentially if we care only about how
many accesses that the processor make

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.610
go beyond a level 2 cache,
then we would really be seeing this.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.650
But note that this hit rate really
includes the hit rate of the level

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.980
1 cache and what are the actual
hits in the level 2 cache.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.100
So when we talk about the cache size and
how bigger caches behave better and

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.180
so on as far as hit rate is concerned,
usually,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.480
we think about the global hit rate,
because the local hit rate

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.060
heavily depends on what do you
have as the level 1 cache.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.725
If it's a level 3 cache then its
local hit rate would depend on what

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:09.804
is the level 1 hit rate,
what is the level 2 hit rate, and

00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:14.245
only then we even get to
access the level 3 cache.

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:17.900
Its global hit rate is
going to be similar

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.800
to our hit rate of that type of
a cache if it was used alone.
