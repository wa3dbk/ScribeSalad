00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's look at the measurement of this robot in its world with 5 different grid cells--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
x1 through x5.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's assume 2 of those cells are colored
red whereas the other three are green.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As before, we assign uniform probability to each cell of 0.2,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and our robot is now allowed to sense.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What it sees is a red color.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
How will this affect my belief over different places?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Obviously, the one's for x2 and x3 should go up,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the ones for x1, x4, and x5 should go down.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So I'm going to tell you how to incorporate this measurement into our belief

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
with a very simple rule--a product.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Any cell where the color is correct--any of the red cells--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we multiply it with a relatively large number--say, 0.6.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That feels small, but as we will see later, it is actually a large number.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Whereas all the green cells will be 
multiplied with 0.2.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
If we look at the ratio of those, then it seems about 3 times as likely

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to be in a red cell than it is to be in a green cell,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because 0.6 is 3 times larger than 0.2.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now let's do the multiplication.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
For each of those 5 cells, can you tell me what the result would be

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
multiplying in the measurement in the way I've stated.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.151
Please, for these 5 boxes, fill out the number.
