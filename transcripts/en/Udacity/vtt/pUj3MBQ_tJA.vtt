00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay. What I'd like to do here is work out what the general rule is.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Imagine that we've got some node and say it's numbered i.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What can we figure out about the parent number of i and the two child numbers of i?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The child numbers are actually quite easy if you look at them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's always the node number doubled plus 1.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That's the left child and the right child is adjacent to it so that is 2i+2.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And we can work out from this what the number for the parent ought to be.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
All we need to do is subtract one from i and have it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And in Python that will actually cause it to get rounded down,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but in Math symbols we'll just write a little floor here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Let's just double check that. Node 6 , 6-1=5.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Half of 5 is 2-1/2 rounded down is 2. 5-1 is 4. Half of that is 2. We don't have to round it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Both 5 and 6 have the parent of 2. Coming up the other way, 2 doubled plus 1 is 5.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
2 doubled plus 2 is 6 so that gives us this kind of local structure

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and this is repeated throughout.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Therefore we could use this to try to figure out what the right child of 72 would be.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's 72 doubled, which is 144, plus 2, which is 146.
