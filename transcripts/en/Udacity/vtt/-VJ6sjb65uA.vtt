00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.448
What excites me the most about my career is that I think that, that training

00:00:04.448 --> 00:00:08.608
animals in captivity is the absolutely best thing you could do for any animal,

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:15.356
because it teaches them to cooperate with their own care. It gives them freedom

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:21.293
from stress because they learn to understand more about their environment. And

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:25.197
it develops a very positive feeling about their caregivers and their entire

00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:31.808
experience. So we can train animals to do amazing things. Including eye drops

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:37.514
and stomach tubes, inoculations. We have injected the animals with anesthesia

00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:41.621
and removed teeth voluntarily. Instead of having to do something of use of like

00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:46.584
hold them down and force them through a procedure. We can release our animals

00:00:46.584 --> 00:00:50.614
into the open ocean and train them to perform behaviors working with us to work

00:00:50.614 --> 00:00:55.138
as watchdogs. Which is what the military does or as researchers which is what I

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.036
have done working with them in their natural environment and they choose to

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:02.377
come back. On the strength of the basis of the relationship that we have with

00:01:02.377 --> 00:01:07.632
them. So we can take better care of them, as well as, learn from them, as well

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:11.645
as, enrich them through this method.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.585
&gt;&gt; So say I or, you know, one of our students wants do do what you do, how can we

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:16.085
do that?

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:21.516
&gt;&gt; So, we actually offer internships for people. People come all over the world,

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:26.340
and come and work with our sea lions. They can learn how to train the sea lions

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.376
up close and personal. And learn all of these basic psychology techniques. So

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:35.030
even if you're not a psychologist, you can learn how to apply psychology and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.870
practice it right here in the facility with really amazing animals.
