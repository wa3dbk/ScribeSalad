Hey, kids, welcome back.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.370
I thought we'd kick off this lesson in
one of my favorite spots in Atlanta,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.548
Piedmont Park.

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:12.910
This area used to be
a dilapidated fairground, but

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.450
then sometime in the early 1900s it
was transformed into the lovely and

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.450
public open space that you see today.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.860
This transformation, by the way,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.420
was done by the Brothers Olmsted, sons
of Frederick Law Olmsted whom you might

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.770
know as the lead landscape architect
of Central Park in New York City.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.290
Okay.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.340
But why are we here?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.500
Well, this lesson is about parallelizing
computations on the heart and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.220
soul of computer science
data structures, the tree.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.570
You're going to learn
a bunch of tricks for

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.400
extracting parallelism
from tree computations.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.960
These include, for example, taking
the tree, converting it into a line, and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.720
then parallelizing
operations on the line.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.580
Now at some point in this process,
you and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.120
I are going to get a little bit stuck.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.100
So instead of trying to figure out
what to do, we're going to reach for

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.830
a classic trick in the lazy
computer scientist's tool box.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.810
It's called randomization or
more simply flipping coins.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.906
Lucky me.

00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:13.940
In addition to the video,
there is also a reading.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.173
So be sure that you do both, and
while you're busy doing that,

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:20.415
I'm going to go off and feed
the ducks which is probably illegal.

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:22.388
And then I'm going to take a nap.

00:01:22.388 --> 00:01:25.105
Good luck to you and
wake me when you are done.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:35.105
