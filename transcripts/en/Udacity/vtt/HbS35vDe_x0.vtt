00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.460
Now we're going to ask one more quiz question to finish off this lesson. How

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.826
many karma points per post on average would you need to be in the top 5% of

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:13.306
Udacity students? This one's a really tricky one. And it requires going

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:18.432
backwards. So instead of trying to find the proportion less than or greater than

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:23.449
a certain value, we're trying to find what value will give us this proportion.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.575
Try and figure it out yourself. This might take you some time. But I think you

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:29.247
can do it.
