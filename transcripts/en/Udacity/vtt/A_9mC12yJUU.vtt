00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.373
&gt;&gt; Okay 50% of 320 pixels is going to be 160

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:11.446
pixels. Next, we have the paragraph node which is 100% of

00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:16.395
its parent, so that's also going to be 160 pixels. The em

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:20.359
is 50% of its parent, so that's going to be 80 pixels.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.580
And finally, span is 25% of its parent, so that's going to make it 40 pixels.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.400
&gt;&gt; Yep. Great job.
