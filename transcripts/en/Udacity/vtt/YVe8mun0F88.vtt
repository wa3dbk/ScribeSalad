00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.510
We can start out by writing y and equals sign, since we know that we want an

00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:07.174
equation for the total amount of money that Grant spends a month, and that's y.

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:10.863
We also know that no matter how productive his business is, he's going to pay

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:14.323
$1200 in rent. And this is just a constant amount that he's going to spend,

00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:17.718
regardless how much else he spends on other things. Things.

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:23.112
So, you can write 1,200 as a constant and then a plus sign. He'll spend $6.50 on

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:28.207
every single wiper blade he makes. So, we need to add 6.5x to the end of our

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.024
equation. Voila, we have and equation with 2 variables.
