00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.260
So let's talk more about the predict not-taken predictor, which is

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.340
the simplest predictor we can have. It amounts to simply incrementing the PC. So

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.940
this predictor is very simple because all it requires us is to increment the PC.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.980
We know the PC from which we fetched the branch. We know how big the instruction

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.260
is. We can just increment the PC. So there is really no memory to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.100
this predictor or anything else. We have to do the increment of the PC anyway.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.470
Once we figure out it's not a branch, so this predictor pretty much uses

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.120
the hardware we have to have anyway. But the question is how accurate is it.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.900
A rule of thumb is about 20% of all instructions are branches. So

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.870
80% of the time this predictor will be correct, because it's simply not a branch

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.000
instruction. For branches a little more over half of the branches are taken. So,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.250
let's say, that 60% of branches are taken, so what we get is that

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.495
this predictor is correct. 80% of the time, for non branches. And also, another

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:08.200
8% of all the instructions because of the 40% of branches that are not taken.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.378
It is incorrect, 12% of the time. It is incorrect,

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:18.990
60% of 20%, which amounts to 12%. Now, if we know the misprediction penalty,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.850
we can easily compute, what is the impact. On CPI of branch mis-predictions.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.910
The CPI will be one plus, 12% times the penalty.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.324
In a five stage pipeline this would be two. So the CPI would be 1.24
