00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.830
Now, notice that we added 16 in order to complete the square for these two

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.298
terms. But the 16 is inside of these parentheses, and there's a factor of two

00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:15.198
on the outside of the parentheses. This means that we didn't actually just add

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:19.869
16 to the right side of our equation. How much did we really add to the right

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.445
side of the equation? Enter that number here.
