00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.910
The right answer is modula -3 pointers

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.784
are type-specific. That is, pointers in modula-3

00:00:06.784 --> 00:00:09.460
cannot be forged, there's no way to

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.144
subvert the protection mechanism that is built into

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:19.175
the language. So if I have a data structure defined In Modula-3. And if

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:25.255
I have pointer to the data structure, the only way you can use that pointer,

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:31.109
is as a pointer to that type of data structure. You cannot take a data structure

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.849
and cast it to appear like something else, this is something that we as C

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:38.851
programmers, maybe very used to doing, but

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.723
that's not something that is possible in Modula-3.

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:45.667
And that is what allows us to implement

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:50.359
logical protection domains in Modula-3 Using objects and

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:56.480
capabilities to objects as pointers supported by the programming language.
