00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.922
All we need to do for each of these, is to figure out what the cost of the

00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:07.642
order is. Then what the corresponding cost of postage will be. And add those

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:12.462
two quantities together to get the total cost. If a nozzle set costs $9.99, and

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:18.404
that's all were buying, that's under $10. So postage is just $2.75. $9.99 plus

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:23.860
$2.75 equals $12.74. For B, if we do the same thing, our postage is going to be

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.220
$5 instead, and we end up with $54.99. For C and D, we need to add together two

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.630
quantities to find the cost of the order, and our total cost for these two end

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.409
up being $17.98 and $51.98.
