00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.115
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Remember that this first equation, y equals Ax squared plus bx plus C, is the

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:10.169
equation of a problem written in standard form. Because this contains two

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:15.446
variables, x and y, we can use it to graph points on a two dimensional. Plane.

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:19.082
For any value of x that we might want to consider, we can come up with a

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:23.599
corresponding value for y. And then, of course, plot that point on our plane. We

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.911
can't do that with this equation over here. Because there is no variable on the

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:32.095
left side. The only variable in the quadratic equation is x. So clearly, the

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:36.503
equation of parabola relates y to x. Whereas, the quadratic equation does not.

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:40.897
However, the quadratic equation is very powerful and useful for us in it's own

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:45.089
ways. It gives us a very straightforward way for finding the x-coordinates of

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.397
the x-intercepts of the parabola that it corresponds to. And of course, we could

00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:53.557
find that equation, the equation of the parabola, by replacing the zero with y

00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:57.781
again. The other thing that's very useful about a quadratic equation is that it

00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:02.714
can actually be solved. Because we have one variable x in this equation and

00:01:02.714 --> 00:01:07.979
there's only one equation, we can isolate x and find some number of values that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.867
it needs to equal in order to make this equation true. So the equation of a

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:18.503
parabola can yield a graph, A quadratic equation can yield solutions. For values

00:01:18.503 --> 00:01:22.508
of x, that tell us a lot about these graphs of parabolas. I know this is a

00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:26.996
really subtle distinction, so if this seems a little bit confusing at all, that

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:31.391
makes perfect sense. I myself messed this up several times. Several crucial

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:35.746
times, before I really got the difference, so just keep reminding yourself of

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:38.184
the distinction, and when we use each one.
