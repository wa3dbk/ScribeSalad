00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.790
In an earlier part of this lesson module, we saw how to build a subsystem

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.330
that takes advantage of idle memory in peer nodes on a local area network,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.590
namely, using remote memory as a paging device, instead of the local disk. The

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.940
intuition behind that idea was the fact

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.470
that networks have gotten faster. And therefore access

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.409
to remote memory may be faster than access to an electromechanical local disk.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.820
Continuing with this lesson, we will look

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.560
at another way to exploit remote memories,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.160
namely, software implementation of distributed shared

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.355
memory. That is, create an operating system

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:47.740
abstraction that provides an illusion of shared

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.605
memory to the applications, even though the

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:55.600
nodes in the local area network do not physically share memory. So distributed

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.950
shared memory asks the question, if

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.370
shared memory makes life simple for application

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.330
development in a multiprocessor, can we try to provide that same abstraction

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.890
in a distributed system, and make the cluster look like a shared memory machine?
