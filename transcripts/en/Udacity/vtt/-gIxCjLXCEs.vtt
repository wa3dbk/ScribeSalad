00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.200
Let's continue our investigation by looking at some variables

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.030
that are highly correlated. This time we'll look at the

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.430
number of likes users received from friends on the

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.596
desktop version on the site. This is the ww likes

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:15.640
received. We'll compare this variable to the total number

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.670
of likes users received which is the likes received variable.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.130
Now you could of course get likes received through the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.580
mobile version but we're not going to look at that here.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.220
So now I'm going to hand it off to you. I want you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.650
to create a scatter plot of this variable versus this variable and it should

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.330
make sense that likes received should be higher than ww likes received. Since

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.410
some of the likes may be coming from other sources, either mobile or unknown.
