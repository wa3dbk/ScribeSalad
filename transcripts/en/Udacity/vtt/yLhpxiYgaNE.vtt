00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.610
One of the better-known breaches,
cyber attacks,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.440
that occurred towards the end of
2013 was the Target store breach.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.720
So in this case,
you would want to ask this question,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.790
what is of value that
somebody was after?

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.160
And if somebody was after, who was that?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.720
What is the threat source?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.550
Then we can say, well,
what vulnerability did they exploit?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.710
So the Target case, essentially what
they were after was credit card

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.970
data that is there on the point-of-sale
systems that are in Target stores.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.190
The people who are after
it are cyber criminals

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.800
because they want to profit
from the stolen information.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.020
And the vulnerability they
exploited is an interesting one.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.180
So, Target stores had
an HVAC contractor.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.120
The hack actually began with a phishing

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.515
message to an employee
of that HVAC company.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:59.722
Through that phishing attacks, they
were able to get credentials that gave

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:02.900
the cyber criminals access
to Target's network.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.879
And once they were on Target's networks,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.070
then they were able to get to
the point-of-sales systems where they

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.120
installed malware to siphon
off the credit card numbers.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.850
So this is a real-world example
where the security mindset,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.270
essentially we are saying,
where does the threat come from?

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.580
Cyber criminals.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.470
What are they after?

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.510
Credit card data.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.970
What vulnerability was there in
the system that was exploited?

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.110
Well, we just talked about it.
