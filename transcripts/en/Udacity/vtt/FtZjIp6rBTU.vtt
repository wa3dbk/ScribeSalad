00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.656
At the same time as Gloria has been learning about exponential growth to help

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:07.418
her pandas out, Grant has also been trying to figure out exponential functions

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:13.575
to help deal with his company's investments in different bank accounts. Suppose

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:18.225
that Grant wants to invest $10,000 and the bank say, you can get 3% interest

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:25.245
per year compounded yearly. Grant feels confused. The bank explains that

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:29.275
compounded annually means that once a year the total amount of money in the

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:35.033
account is calculated. And then 3% of that amount is added on top of the total

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:39.930
in-, interest. Let's start out by just calculating this for the first three

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.726
years that Grant has the account. I've already written in all the information

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:49.820
that we have and really it's all that we need to figure out the rest of this.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.968
You know that he starts out with $10,000 at the beginning of the first year

00:00:53.968 --> 00:01:00.276
that he invests. Our interest rate is 3%. So that means that 0.03 times this

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:07.640
amount will be added to the account at the end of the year. 0.03 times $10,000

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.910
is 300. 10,000 plus 300 makes 10,300. Since this is the amount that's present

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.444
at the end of year 1, it's the amount that's present at the beginning of year

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:27.497
2. So year 2 starts off with 10300. What I would like you to do right now is to

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:32.140
fill in the missing information in each of these cells. How much interest will

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.989
he earn in the second year? And how much will that give him at the end of year

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:41.672
2? Use that as the start of year 3 and then calculate the new amount of

00:01:41.672 --> 00:01:44.960
interest and then the new total.
