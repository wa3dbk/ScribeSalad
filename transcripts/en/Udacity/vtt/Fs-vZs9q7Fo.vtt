00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.994
When we carry out this long division, what we end up with up here, is x squared

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:09.930
minus 3 x minus 2. And note that down here, in our remainder spot, we have a 4

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.970
this time instead of a 0. This is proof that x minus 1 is not a factor of this

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.510
polynomial. Since we have a 4 left over, this doesn't go into our original

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.453
expression evenly.
