00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.018
The answer is it doesn’t work very well. So the

00:00:03.018 --> 00:00:06.753
reason for this is that anyone observing these

00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:08.953
messages given that there is only a small

00:00:08.953 --> 00:00:12.115
set while you can compute this value given the

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:16.161
public keys of C, B and A, you can compute the

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:20.002
value of Xi for the three possible votes, match

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.949
that up to the incoming votes, know exactly what

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.597
they are so there is no anonymity for the voters,

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:28.548
so either A or an eavesdropper could do this.

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:30.783
The second choice is a little more ambiguous.

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:32.636
See you could output any votes at once,

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:34.317
there is nothing that verifies the votes that C

00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:37.603
outputs. But in this case because the encryption is

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:41.774
broken, someone looking at that votes that come in

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.379
knows what the votes are already and knows if C

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.795
cheats but there’s no point to the Mixnet if this is

00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:50.041
what we do. So we need to do something different;

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:52.239
this by itself is not going to work. What we need

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.000
to do is add some randomization to our encryption.
