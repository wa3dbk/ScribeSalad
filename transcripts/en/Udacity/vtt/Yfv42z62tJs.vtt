00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.899
So what goes into a regular expression? Well, we saw one example where the star was a special character,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:17.999
and where, for example, A* represents "a," "aa," "aaa," and so on, as well as the empty string,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.732
because it could be zero occurrences of A.

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:27.332
So let's make a list of the special characters, examples of their use, and what they match.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:32.232
So we've seen the asterisk. Another special character is the question mark.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:39.999
So "A?" matches either the empty string or the single string A, and nothing else.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.799
So it means an optional occurrence of whatever comes before. In this case, an A.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.432
It could be a B, a C, whatever.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:56.266
Another special character is the dot or period, and that stands by itself. It doesn't have a two-character sequence.

00:00:56.267 --> 00:01:08.399
And so for example, a dot can match the character A or the character B or C or 7 or exclamation point,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.599
or any other single character.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.732
But it doesn't match the empty string, and it doesn't match a multiple character string.

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:23.466
We're almost done. There's only two more special characters in this subset of regular expressions that I want to talk about.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:29.399
Languages like Python have very complicated patterns that they match against for regular expression.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.399
Some of them go beyond regular to irregular expressions.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.499
But we're going to talk about a specific subset that we can write a program for to do regular expression matching.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.132
And it's only going to have five special characters.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:49.932
So these three, then the up arrow, again, is a character that's by itself, not a two-character sequence.

00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:58.599
So the up arrow by itself matches only right at the beginning of the line, or, that is, the beginning of the text that we're matching against.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.199
And so it's not much use by itself, but in conjunction with another character, it can limit the match to the beginning.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:20.866
So for example, up arrow-B matches against any string that starts with a B, like "ba" or "bb" or anything else where B is the first character,

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:26.099
but it doesn't match something where the B is in the middle, like ABC,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.399
Whereas B by itself would match against ABC in the middle.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:43.199
And finally, $ is the convention for matching at the end. So, A$ matches "ba", but doesn't match, say,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.166
"ab" or anything else where the A isn't at the end.

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:51.999
So let's correctly strike these out to say that these are not matches for these two patterns.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.299
Okay, so that's it. These are the five special characters.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.899
What else goes into a regular expression? Well, the empty string, and the only example of the empty string is the empty string.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.799
And what does that match? Only the empty string.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.932
Then any character that's not one of these five, like an A, that matches exactly the character itself.

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:14.932
A matches A, B matches B, and so on.

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:24.099
And finally, any concatenation of two regular expressions matches those two one followed by another.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:33.866
So, "ba", that matches "ba", but doesn't match other sequences, like "aa" or "bb".

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:40.032
Okay. So that's my language for regular expressions. Five special characters, empty character, one character,

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:43.767
or two regular expressions concatenated to each other.
