00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.380
So, here I have a directory on my local machine,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.430
which contains a couple of files, and I want to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.310
put one of them into hdfs. All of the commands

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.480
which interact with the Hadoop file system start with Hadoop

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.490
FS. So first of all, let's see what we have

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.300
in hdfs to start with. I do that by saying

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.590
hadoop fs minus ls. That gives me a listing of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.890
what's in my home directory on the Hadoop cluster. Because

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
I'm logged in to the local machine as a user called training, my home directory

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.850
in hdfs is /user/training. And as you can see, there's nothing there. So

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.080
now, let's upload our purchases.txt file. We do that

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.482
with hadoop fs minus put purchases.txt. Hadoop fs minus put

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:51.050
takes a local file and places it into hdfs. Since I'm not specifying

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.905
a destination filename, it'll be uploaded with the same

00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.190
filename. So, it takes a few seconds to upload. And

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.010
now I can do another hadoop fs minus ls, and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.060
we can see that that file is now in hdfs.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.400
I can take a look at the last few

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.740
lines of the file by saying, hadoop fs minus tail,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.330
and then the filename, and that just displays the last

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.210
few lines on the screen for me. There's also a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
hadoop fs minus cat, which will display the

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.070
entire contents of the file and we'll use that

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.510
later. There are plenty of other hadoop fs commands

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.570
and as you'll probably have started to realize, they

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.980
closely mirror standard UNIX file system commands. So, if I want to rename the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.167
file, for example, I can say hadoop fs minus mv, which moves

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:41.572
purchases.txt, in this case, to newname.txt. If I want

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:47.265
to delete a file, hadoop fs minus rm will remove that file for me. So,

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:52.621
let's get rid of newname.txt from hdfs. I create a directory in hdfs by

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:55.163
saying hadoop fs minus mkdir and then

00:01:55.163 --> 00:01:59.263
the directory name, and now let's upload purchases.txt

00:01:59.263 --> 00:02:04.839
and place it in the myinput directory so that it's ready for processing by hdfs.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.360
Once I've done that, hadoop fs minus ls myinput will show me

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.850
the contents of that directory. And just as I expected, there's the file.
