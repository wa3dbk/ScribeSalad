00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.159
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know that 5x over 6 is just the same as 5 6ths times x. So to get rid of

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:09.863
this coefficient of 5 6ths, we just need to multiply each side by its

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:15.422
reciprocal, which is 6 5ths. And we end up with x equals 24 over 5. Let's check

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:20.457
our answer just to be sure. We plug 24 over 5 back into the original equation.

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:25.078
We're going to start by just working with the left hand side of the equation and

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:29.381
seeing if what we end up with is equal to the right side. 5 times 24 over 5 is

00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:33.925
just 24, and we leave the denominator the same, since we didn't do anything to

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:38.819
it. 24 over 6 is 4. The left hand side simplifies to 4, which is equal to our

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.015
right hand side. So we are good.
