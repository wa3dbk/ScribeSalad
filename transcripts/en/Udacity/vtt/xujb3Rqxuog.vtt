00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.530
Our goal is to get you
a job in machine learning.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.910
So we highly recommend you take
advantage of the opportunities that

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.270
Marion described.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.860
The career development opportunities
throughout this nanodegree program

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.160
are just as important
as the content itself.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.780
And we encourage you to take advantage
of everything you're enrollment in this

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.550
nanodegree program gets you.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.980
Getting a job is about far more
than just knowing the material.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.430
But to get the job you do
need to know the material.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.190
So let's get started talking about
the foundations of the machine learning

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.431
engineer in nanodegree program.
