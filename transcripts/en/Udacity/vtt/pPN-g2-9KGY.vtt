00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, once again, I recommend getting started by drawing the finite state machine.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So on a or on b, we go over to state 2,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we could end there because this is optional,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or on c or d, we could go to state 3 and end there.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Here at the top, I've encoded the edges from state 1 on a we go to state 2.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
From state 1 on b, we go to state 2 as well--a or b.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
From state 2 on c, we go to state 3.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
From state 2 on d, we go to state 3.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And both states, 2 and 3, are accepting.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Then down here, I have 3 test cases.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"ac" which should be accepted.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
"aX" which should not. X has no business in this regular expression.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And just "b" alone, which should be fine because the c - d part is optional.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's go see.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And we get exactly the output we were expecting--true, false, true.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now you might have been tempted to have a c - d self-loop back to 2,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
instead of this right-hand side of the finite state machine.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
However, this self-loop changes the meaning to "[a - b][c - d]*".

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If you have this self-loop, acc is accepted--a-c-c, and it shouldn't be,

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so the self-loop is not the right way to go.
