00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.609
Of course work and

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:05.290
understanding how the brain processes
visual information continues.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.510
One of the interesting things has been,
sort of, separating out the, there

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.240
seems to be work in, in, understanding
that the layout of your visual field,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.370
the geometry of your field is different
than understanding what's in your

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.154
field that is the, the,
detection of things.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:26.190
And so notionally here,
here's an interesting little picture.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.780
The idea is that things come in, in V1
and then V2 starts to go up this area.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.150
This is the V3, V4 subsegment that
sort of does the recognition.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.950
This is sort of what's there.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.730
At the same time, there seems to be
what's referred to as this action

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.270
pathway where V1 has a lot of
projections into this V3 V5 area

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.180
that's sensitive to, it is sensitive
to shape, but the movements of shapes.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.410
And then there's always connections,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.270
cause there's connections
everywhere in the brain.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.170
But the idea is that
in the parietal lobes,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.390
that's a different structure up here,
is more of an understanding of action.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.370
So you have this one pathway that's
sort of the stuff that's there, and

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.990
another one that has to do with
sort of how stuff's moving,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.240
or, or where stuff is moving.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.360
There's another whole cool area of,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.960
another cool way of investigating
what goes on in the brain.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.990
If you presume that there are these
different kinds of process steps

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.420
going on in different locations, then
you would expect that people who have

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.190
certain types of brain injuries or,
or birth defect issues or

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.770
whatever, that certain parts of
the brain aren't working You would be

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.080
able to find selective elements of
their visual processing not function.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.230
We know this is true in language.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.980
Strokes in different areas can cause you
to lose either semantics versus syntax.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.550
So what happens in vision?

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.470
Well, there's this
very well known woman.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.550
She has this very interesting phenomena,
she cannot see motion.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.250
So like, she can't cross a street.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.050
She'll look down there and
she'll see the car there.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.580
And then, you know, two seconds later,
she'll see the car here.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.900
But she has no perception that
the car is actually moving.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.940
'Kay, so
she can't actually cross the street.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.570
All right?
Because she doesn't get any

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.930
understanding of sort of that
space time evolution of things.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.490
So that, you can think of that as
an example of there's this part that's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.470
doing this motion and action stuff that,
in her brain, is just not working.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.690
Remember she recognizes cars and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.820
toothpaste and all the different
kinds of things in her world.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.390
But she doesn't get a perception
of the motion and the action.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.310
And this is the type of thing that
leads further credence to the idea that

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.160
there's a separate pathway, this,
this separate part of the brain that is

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.810
processing this kind of information
that obviously she doesn't have.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.630
So, the idea would be that you know
this action pathway shown here Somehow

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.650
is not functioning as well as
it should in her, in her brain.
