00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.370
This was the motivation for coming up

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.820
with this abstraction of distributed shared memory

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.240
in a cluster. The idea is that we want to give the illusion to the application

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.129
programmer writing and explicitly parallel program. That

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.260
all of the memory that's in the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.120
entire cluster is shared. They are not

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.470
physically shared, but the DSM library is going to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.110
give the illusion to the threads running on each

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.270
one of these processes that all of this memory

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.150
is shared. And therefore they have an easier transition

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.990
path for instance, from going from a sequential program or

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.550
going from a program that they've written on an

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.440
SMP. To a program that runs on the cluster, because

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.190
they don't have to think in terms of message

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.240
passing. But they can think in terms of shared memory,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.630
sharing pointers across the entire cluster, and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.700
so on. Also, since we are providing a

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.880
shared memory semantic in the DSM library for

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.260
the application program There is no need for

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.170
marshalling and unmarshalling arguments that are being passed

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.640
from one processor to another and so on.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.420
All of that is being handled by the fact that there is shared memory. So when

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.540
you make a procedure call, and that procedure

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.680
call is touching Some portion of memory that

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.460
happens to be on a remote memory. That

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.440
memory is going to magically become available to the thread

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.310
that is making the procedure call. In other

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.780
words, the DSM abstraction gives the same level

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.630
of comfort to a programmer who's used to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.440
programming on a true shared memory machine when they

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.160
moved to cluster. Because they can use same set of primitives,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.630
like locks and barriers for synchronization, and the Pthread [GUESS] style of

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.040
creating threads, that will run on different nodes of the cluster. And that's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.780
the advantage of DSM style of writing an explicitly parallel program.
