00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
And, well, it's a bit of an opinion here but I would say that--actually for each three of these,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.190
you could say maybe, so if you don't have much time to design and program an algorithm,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.280
then brute force might be okay under certain conditions.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.140
For example when your instances are small and you have proper time to run the algorithm,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.620
then brute force might actually be a good idea because it's your time that you invest

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.490
into programming a more sophisticated algorithm.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.600
If it's your time that counts and not computer time, doing brute force

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.369
is sometimes actually a good solution.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.020
Whenever the instances are small, there's two reasons to us brute force.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.520
One is because you can implement it very fast, but the other good reason to us brute force

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.720
in these cases here is that because brute force algorithms are so simple they can be programmed

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.960
with very little overhead, so what I mean by that is that the constants that are involved

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.720
in the O notation are rather small and for small instances, such speedups actually play a role.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.160
For small instances, it could be a good idea to use brute force,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.300
but again even for the small instances, it might not be fast enough.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.850
What you need to solve a problem only once--that might also be a condition where a brute force

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.070
could be okay--that might mean that you have a lot of computational time available.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.160
Say you need to have this problem solved within the next 3 months or 6 months,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.960
maybe then brute force is kind of fast enough.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.860
Of course, in this case down here, I think that's the most debatable.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.780
You might want to try some of the more sophisticated

00:01:26.780 --> 99:59:59.000
techniques that I'm about to show you.
