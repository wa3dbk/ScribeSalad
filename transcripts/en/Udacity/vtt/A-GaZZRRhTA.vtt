00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.041
So to answer this, we want to look at these for loops

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:08.229
and decide how many times each warp is going to have to execute the for loop.

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:13.347
And that means how many times at least 1 thread in the warp is going to have to execute it.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:18.897
So looking at this expression here, for a single warp these values will vary from 0 to 31.

00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:26.110
So there will be at least 1 thread in that warp for whom this modulo expression evaluates to 31.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.143
And that means that the entire warp is going to go through the motions

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:33.217
of executing this bar function 31 times.

00:00:33.217 --> 00:00:36.881
Now, some of those times some of the threads will be deactivated.

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:42.011
So the very first time, thread 0 will not execute the bar function.

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.823
It will be deactivated because i will not be less than 0.

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:49.054
And the next time thread 0 and 1 will be deactivated and so forth.

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:53.695
Ultimately, the total amount of time that the warp has to spend in this loop

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:58.009
depends on the total number of time that any 1 thread has to spend on it.

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.670
Each warp will executive this loop 31 times.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.680
This next loop, though, is different.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.771
In this case the integer divide means that threads 0 through 31 are going to evaluate to 0.

00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:14.118
This expression will evaluate to 0, and therefore they're not going to execute the bar function at all.

00:01:14.118 --> 00:01:19.754
And in threads 32 through 63 we'll evaluate this expression to 1,

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:22.155
and they'll execute the loop 1s and so forth.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:28.106
So there will be 1 warp which evaluates at 0 times, 1 warp which evaluates at 1 time,

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:32.785
1 that evaluates at 2 times and so forth, all the way up to a single warp,

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:35.289
which evaluates at 31 times.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.938
So the average number of times that all of the warps will execute this loop is 15.5.

00:01:42.938 --> 00:01:45.674
So now we know what we need to know to answer the question.

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:52.222
Clearly, the second loop will execute faster, and it will be twice as fast

00:01:52.222 --> 00:01:57.491
because, on average, the number of times that the expensive bar function gets evaluated

00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:02.743
is half the number of times that that bar function gets evaluated during the first loop.
