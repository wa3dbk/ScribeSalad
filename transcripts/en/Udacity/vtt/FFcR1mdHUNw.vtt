00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.133
Here's a zoom in of the origional geometry, and here's a view after my

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.880
modifications. I changed the legs and feet of the model to have rounded edges.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.520
So, instead of a block with perfectly sharp edges, there's a small bevel. This

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.244
detail looks a bit more realistic, since most plastic parts are not razor sharp.

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:21.418
More importantly, a bevel let's the model pick up specular highlights along its

00:00:21.418 --> 00:00:26.534
edge. Here's sharp edges again. Here's smooth. It's worth keeping in mind that

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:30.080
specular highlights don't add all that much to flat surfaces. Which is why I use

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.903
the teapot for most material demos in this unit.
