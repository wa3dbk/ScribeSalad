The last principle that I would like to mention to you is also the most abstract

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.770
one. It is called the Principle of Intentionality. That is, design your software

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.310
in such a way that your intent is manifest and localized in the code. What this

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.610
means is that the conceptual distance between the problem that you are trying to

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.100
solve, and the code with which you are solving it is as small as possible.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.500
Intentionality supports traceability, validation and maintainability. You can

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.100
improve intentionality by appropriate use of cohesion, and naming conventions.
