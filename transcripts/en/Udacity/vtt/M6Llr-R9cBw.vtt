Thanks Gregg. So finally your on two and a half to three years old children

00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:09.138
begin the third phase of language development which is the sentence phase. Here

00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:12.927
they begin speaking in grammatical sentences. Now we know that children go

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:17.110
through predictable stages of language acquisition. That's from cooing to

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.330
babbling then onto one word utterances. Then two-word utterances. And finally,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.095
into the sentence phase. Now, all of this happens in approximately the first

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:30.860
three years of life. It's no coincidence that the brain of a three year-old

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.435
child is about 80% of an adult size brain. Again, this demonstrates the

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.571
importance of the size of our brain and our ability to develop and understand

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.939
language.
