00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.140
Okay. So we are back to the code and all

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.210
I have done is added the translate function to our program.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.560
So what this code is doing now, is saying, for

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.330
each file or for each photo, inside our folder, rename it.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.870
Here is the old file name and here is the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.070
new file name devoid of any numbers. Now my hypothesis is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.710
that if I save and run this program, all of the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.260
photo files will be renamed and we'll see the secret message.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.370
So let me go ahead and save it and run the program.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.670
Oh wow. That clearly did not work. Would you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.210
mind reading through this editor and telling us what

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.300
you think is the problem? Once you have a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.020
hypothesis, feel free to enter it into the box provided.
