00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.150
All I need to do to solve for x is take the natural log of each side of each

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.420
equation. For e to the x equals 3, that gives us x equals ln 3, which is about

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.070
equal to 1.099. For e to the x equals 2, we end up with x equals ln of 2, which

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.380
is about to 0.693. Now let's remember what these mean. These are both zeros of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.860
the function f of x equals e to the 2x minus 5e to the x plus 6. Now in the

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.070
practice section, you'll be able to see how this works a little bit more

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.420
clearly.
