00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
Enough with introducing new words to you.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.360
What is the algorithm that I propose that Dave should use?

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.870
It's a very simple one actually.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.220
The algorithm is now quite simple to describe.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.380
Of course it takes a bit more effort to actually implement it.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.850
Given any graph, the first step that we do is we calculate

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.850
a minimum spanning tree for that graph.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.470
That is something if you have had an algorithms class you know to be doable in polynomial time.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.880
That can be done in O(n²) time for an in vertext graph.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.250
Then you take a walk along the tree, and you can guess that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.340
that can be done in polynomial time as well.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.750
The running time of this alogirthm here in total---so it's a polynomial time algorithm.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.880
Now where I probably need to convince you is that this is actually

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.250
a good approximation algorithm, because it sounds so simple again doesn't it?

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.000
My claim now is, as I've written here, that this is an approximation algorithm for shortest tour.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Actually it's a constant factor approximation algorithm for that problem.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830
So how come?

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.040
Well, since you already saw one constant factor approximation algorithm,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.640
I am actually going to let you figure this out.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.780
Let's start out by taking 2 numbers and comparing them.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.460
The first number is the weight of the minimum spanning tree,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.100
and by weight I simply mean if you take the sum over all edges that are in the spanning tree,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.190
that's what I will call the weight of the spanning tree.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.210
The second one is going to be the length of the shortest tour for the network.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.690
Now first of all I would like you to tell me what you can say about these 2 numbers.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.690
How do they compare?

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.960
Is the weight of the tree smaller than the length of the shortest tour?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.110
Is it smaller than or equal to the length of the shortest tour?

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.680
Are both the same value?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.890
Or is the weight of the tree larger than or equal to the length of the shortest tour?

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.250
Or is it always larger than the length of the shortest tour?

00:01:58.250 --> 99:59:59.000
Please select which one is correct here.
