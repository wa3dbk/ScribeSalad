The answers are, when generating a report, probably a

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.520
task queue makes sense. Because that sounds like it

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.680
could take awhile. When registering a new user, the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.190
user probably immediately want to see that the operation was

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.160
successful. So the http thread makes sense. When checking

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.030
out a shopping cart, probably the http thread as

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.850
well. Doing photo face recognition, a task queue. That

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.250
may take a long time to do. And the user

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.400
probably, doesn't need to see the result immediately.
