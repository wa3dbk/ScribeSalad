00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.241
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How does this sort of work into the design process? I mean, I've heard of

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.633
this thing rapid prototyping, how does that, what's that all mean as far as 3D

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:11.619
printing. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The real hindrance with 3D printing right now is scale. It's very

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.458
cost prohibitive to print things like that are very large and scale. We have a

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:19.242
motor cycle in the gallery. But, that's pretty big print and it took a lot of

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:23.932
time and so there's this other idea out there called rapid prototyping and there

00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:28.692
you see products like one, two, three make things that take very large objects

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:32.968
like this elephant. Or last year refer maker fair we did a 12 foot tall trojan

00:00:32.968 --> 00:00:37.105
horse out of cardboard. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it takes those big elements and it takes them out

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:40.948
into folded panels or it takes them like as you can see in the octopus in the

00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:45.102
background into sliced cardboard cutouts. So we can use something like a laser

00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:48.475
cutter to make things very larger very quickly. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So it's just a matter of

00:00:48.475 --> 00:00:52.105
time, so right, I usually think of three D printing because, since you're doing

00:00:52.105 --> 00:00:54.882
layer by layer by layer, that can take a while. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The higher

00:00:54.882 --> 00:00:57.570
resolution you have, I would think the more layers you have to put down. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.260
its a really interesting time too because the high end 3D printers are extremely

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.675
high res and very slow [laugh] and very high cost. In the consumer grade

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:11.436
printers, things like a maker bot or a typing machine they're extremely low res

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:15.852
and very fast [laugh] but their cost is kind of going up and the high res stuff,

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:20.199
the cost is kind of going down so I think the next couple of years, we're going

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:24.495
to see a meet in the middle. And you're going to end up with this great device

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:28.464
that almost anybody can use and give you know, a print that is very usable for

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:29.423
multiple things.
