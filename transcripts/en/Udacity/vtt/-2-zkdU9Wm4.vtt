Constraint propagation also connects to human cognition.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.350
First, constraint propagation is a very general purpose method like,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.930
means analysis. In both knowledge based AI and in human cognition,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.710
constraint propagation allows us to use our knowledge of the world,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.470
in order to make sense of it. Constraints can be of any kind. Symbolic,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.220
as well as numeric. We discussed symbolic constraints in today's lesson.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.200
A good example of numeric constraints comes from XL spreadsheets,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.820
with which most of you are familiar. If the columns in a particular

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.290
spreadsheet are connected to some formula, and you make a change in one column,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.540
then the change is propagated into all the columns of the spreadsheet.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.890
That's an example of Numerical Constraint Propagation.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.320
We have seen constraint propagation under other topics as well.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.650
For example, planning, and understanding, and scripts. The next topic,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.800
configuration, will build on this notion of constraint propagation.
