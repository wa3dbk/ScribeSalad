00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.280
The .exit selection called in just the same way as .enter after data bind,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.720
represents something of the inverse of .enter.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.480
The right circle here corresponds to every HTML or SVG element on our page.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.880
It might have previously been bound to data, but in a new call to .data,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.030
no longer correspond to a row in our data file.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.260
So rather, every part of the right circle, which represents elements currently

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.620
on our page, which don't overlap with anything in the left circle,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.150
which corresponds to rows of data, which simply leaves us.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.530
HTML or SVG elements currently on the page which are not

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.700
bound to rows of our data.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.790
Dot exit's usually used if you initially draw a chart and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.480
have subselections where users can filter based on a category or

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.620
some animation where the data from one point in time to the next changes.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.060
And often .exit is used to remove elements from the page which you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.250
should no longer display.
