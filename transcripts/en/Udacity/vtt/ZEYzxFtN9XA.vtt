00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.330
The absolutely indispensable
element of dynamic programming

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.520
is what we'll call an optimal
similar substructure.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.360
By this I mean that we have some hard
problems that we want to solve and

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.250
we think to ourselves, oh, if I only
had the answer to these two similar,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.230
smaller subproblems this would be easy.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.200
And because the subproblems
are similar to the original,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.160
we can keep playing this game,
letting the problems get smaller and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.340
smaller, until we've
reached a trivial case.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.900
Well, at first, this feels like
an ideal case for recursion.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.660
Since those subproblems are similar,
perhaps we can use the same code and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.510
just change the parameters.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.410
Starting from this hard problem,
we could recurse back to this one,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.670
and then to this one, and so

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.060
forth using this whole subgraph
here to solve this subproblem.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.380
But when we recurse through this branch
we would come to this node again and

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.570
do all this recomputation again,
which would be terribly wasteful.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.531
This is sometimes called one
of the perils of recursion.

00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:59.724
And it's often illustrated to beginning
programmers with the example of

00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:02.170
computing the Fibonacci sequence.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.710
Each number in the Fibonacci sequence is
the sum of the previous two numbers, and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.000
the first two numbers
are one to get us started.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.457
This hard problem of computing the nth
number in the sequence depends on

00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:18.471
solving the slightly easier
problems of computing the n-1 and

00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:20.788
the n-2 elements in the sequence.

00:01:20.788 --> 00:01:26.124
Figuring out n-1 depends
on n-2 as well as n-3.

00:01:26.124 --> 00:01:32.153
N-2 depends on knowing the answer
to n-3 and n-4, and so forth.

00:01:32.153 --> 00:01:36.661
Thinking about how the recursion
will operate here,

00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:43.083
notice that we need to compute Fn-2
once for Fn, and once also for Fn-1.

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:46.052
So there's going to be some
repeated computation here, and

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:49.800
it's going to get worse and
worse the further to the left we go.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.418
How bad does it get?

00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:56.310
Well, the top-level problem of computing
the nth number will only be called once,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.910
and here we'll call the f-1
subproblem once as well.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.590
Computing S of n- 2
needs to happen once for

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.100
each time that the 2 computations
that depend on it are called.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.427
Once for n- 1 and once for n.

00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:15.590
Similarly, n -3 needs
to be called once for

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.580
every time that the subproblems
that depend on it are called.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.565
Twice for Fn-2 and once for
Sn-1 for a total of 3.

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:33.120
Fn-4 gets computed once for
each time that Fn0-3 is called and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.440
once for each time that Fn-2
is called for a total of 5.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.250
Notice that each number here is the sum
of the two numbers to the right.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.650
So this actually is the Fibonacci
sequence, and the number of the times

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.060
that the n-kth number is computed will
be equal to the kth Fibonacci number,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.590
which is roughly the golden
ratio raised to the kth power.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.760
So yikes!

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.680
This recursive strategy is exponential.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.190
Of course, computing the Fibonacci
numbers doesn't need to be exponential.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.594
We could just start on the left here,

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:09.786
initializing the first
two numbers to 1 and 1.

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:10.489
And then,

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.267
compute the next one as the sum of
the previous two with a simple for loop.

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:18.860
There are two ways to cope with this
problem of repeated computation.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.330
One, is to memoized the answer
to the subproblems.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.690
After we solve it the first time we
write ourselves a memo with the answer

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.540
and before we actually do
the work of solving a subproblem

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.420
we always check our wall of memos to
see if we have the answer already.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.430
So for instance, for this subproblem
here I would have memoized it,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.400
written myself a memo to remember
that I've already done it.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.540
And so, when I come this path here,
I wouldn't redo all this computations.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.530
I'd just look up the answer.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.360
Alternatively, we can solve
the subproblems in the right order, so

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.230
that any time we want to solve one
of these problems we're sure that we

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.040
have the answer to its
subproblems already.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.480
This can always be done because
the dependency relationships

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.690
among the subproblems must
form a directed graph.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.330
If they're a cycle, then we would
have a circular dependence and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.370
the recursion wouldn't work either.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.240
So we just find an appropriate ordering
of the subproblems so that all the edges

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.450
go left to right, and then we solve
the subproblems in left to right order.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.899
This is the approach we'll take for
this lesson.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.290
It tends to expose more of the
underlying nature of the problem, and

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.100
create faster implementations than
using recursion and memoizing.
