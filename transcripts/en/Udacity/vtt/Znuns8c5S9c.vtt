00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
This is a good time to revisit 
our final detail wireframe.

00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:06.605
For each weather forecast, 
we're going to need to store

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:12.797
at least the date, the condition, the high
and low temperature, the humidity,

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.016
the wind speed and direction, 
and the barometric pressure.

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.568
Since our database will use row 
to represent each forecast day,

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:26.757
we'll store each piece of data associated
with the forecast in a separate column.
