00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.350
Let's discuss the solution
to our TLB performance quiz.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.960
We have a one megabyte array that
we are reading one byte at a time.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.670
One megabyte is 2 to the 20th bytes.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.890
Our page is 4 kilobytes,
which is 2 to the 12th.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.690
So there are 256 pages in this array.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.970
Now what happens is,
once you have the first access,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.130
you will have a level one TLB miss.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.310
A level two will be missed and
the translation will be generated and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.100
placed in both TLB's.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.210
Next, when we access the second byte,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
we have a TLB hit because that byte is
in the same page as the previous one.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.330
So after the first miss
we will have hits for

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.950
the remainder of the four kilobyte page.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.725
In the first sweep we will
have 256 L1 TLB misses,

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:57.330
cause that's how many pages we accessed,
and we will have 4095.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:04.569
This is one less than four kilobytes,
times 256.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.710
They'll be hits at L1.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.210
After this first sweep, the Level 1 TLB
contains the entries for the second half

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.810
of the array, because the array needs
256 pages, we only have 128- entry.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.340
The level two TLB, however,
contains the mappings for

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.190
the entire array because it's still
has enough elements to hold them.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.130
So what's going to happen after the
first sweep, is the level one TLB will

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.460
continue doing this 256 hits and
this many misses each time we sweep,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.190
but the level two TLB will
start hitting all the time.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.258
So what we have is ten times
two-fifty-six misses here and

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:57.860
ten times 4095 times 256 hits here.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.530
Now the question is for
L2 what do we have?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.500
We know that we will have 256 misses,
that is because during

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.180
the first sweep we have no mappings for
any of the 256 pages.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.130
After the first sweep We will have
the mapping for all the pages so

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.170
we will only have hits, but
the question is how many of them?

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.350
Well know that we only
access the level two TLB

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.130
if we have a miss in the level one TLB.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.510
So the number of hits here will
be this minus this, so for

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.450
nine sweeps we will be having
these Misses go here and big hits.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.400
So this is the answer to this quiz.
