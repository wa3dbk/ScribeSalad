00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's make a scatter plot.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Please take a piece of paper and graph the size relative to the price

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as you are now used to in scatter plots.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
My question for you is when you graph this is the data linear.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That is, can you fit a line through the scatter plot data?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yes or no?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Please graph it very carefully and then make your judgment.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's a non-trivial question.
