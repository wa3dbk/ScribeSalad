00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I would like to show you a little bit about how a tool that my research group created

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
called Csmith works, and so Csmith is just a random test case generator.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We use it to try break C compilers. Let's just take a little bit of a look and see how it works.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What I'm going to do here is shell into a machine belonging to my group.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And we're going to look at an in-progress Csmith run that's been going for a couple of days.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's see the results. Let's see what happened. Okay.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So here's what happened over the last couple of days with this testing run.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So what I'm doing is making a program using Csmith and then using the latest version of GCC

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the latest version of clang that is LLVM C front-end to compile each test case

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with a variety of optimization levels.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And I'm not using any kind of weird optimization levels.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm basically just compiling it. -00, -01, -02.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And it doesn't matter if you're not a C compiler user.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
These are basically the sort of vanilla compiler optimization levels that any compiler user

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
would probably be using so what the bottom of this output shows us is that 150 thousand tests

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
have ran since I started this testing run and during this testing run GCC has failed

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
a half dozen times or so, clang has failed a few times, and also we see a few Csmith failures.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It could be that the Csmith failures are actual bugs but historically speaking most of the time

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
these are timeouts and so generally all of these tools are ran in their timeouts

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
when we use a random testing loop because random test tend to be really good at finding

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
performance pathologies but the tool runs for a really long time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And that wastes time so what we do is we just kill any tool after it has ran for several minutes

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
including our random test case generator itself so let's see what we can learn here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So what I'm going to do is look and see if we found any interesting LLVM failures.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And so when LLVM crashes it always tells us how it crashed using an assertion violation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And so as I've discussed a couple of units ago, many real programs contain a lot of assertions

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and these compilers certainly have that property. Okay.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So what we can see is that LLVM has crashed it looks like 4 times here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
One time with a message about wrong topological sorting.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And 3 times with a message about unknown live-in to the entry block.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And it turns out that I happen to know that this wrong topological sorting bug is not new.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is the one that I reported a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
On the other hand, this unknown live-in to the entry block bug is probably new.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So one thing we could do is check in LLVM's Bugzilla if this actually is new,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but what I'm going to do now is just assume that it is and let's take a little bit of a look at this bug.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So here we are in the actual log of Csmith's output.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And that it's telling us is what command line arguments it used when it invoked Csmith

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to generate the program that killed clang.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And so what you can see is it contains a bunch of options but also it contains the random number

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
seed that Csmith uses so we're going to need to cut and paste this,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and we can pass this to a different script, which is going to generate this program again.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And let's edit it. Let's look at it.
