Nice job getting through this lesson.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.790
By now, you should have a guide which
shows you the skills that are necessary

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.655
for you to meet your goals and
where you could use some help.

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:11.280
In this next lesson, you'll use
this guide as you learn more about

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.420
the different options you have to
fill any skill gaps you found.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.250
We'll explore hiring, outsourcing,
freelancers, mentors and

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.000
business partners as common options
you have to help with your business.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.770
So, bring your guide and
we'll see you there.
