00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.589
So we're going to keep going.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.690
Started with law.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.090
Spent a little bit of
time talking on ethics.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.560
But then going to move on to privacy.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.520
And privacy's something that we all
have some idea of what it is and

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.770
the fact that we want it.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.640
It actually goes all the way
back to Justice Brandeis.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.176
Famous thing about
the right to be left alone,

00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:26.640
but we want to examine it in the context
of, again, the online world.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.800
So how do we define
privacy in this context?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.860
Privacy is obviously related
to information about us.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.970
In this context it'll be information
related to what we do online, and

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.920
data that we have in the visible form.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.560
So definition basically is
a user's ability to control.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.700
So that's the key thing here, control.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.560
How data pertaining to us or
our activities Can be collected.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.450
Who can actually collect such data?

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.520
You do your things, you visit a website,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.770
you send an email, you make
a phone call, whatever it takes,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.580
but who can collect information
about these activities?

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.530
How can this information be used,
and can they,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.050
the entity that collects it,
share it with somebody else?

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.770
Here are the company, agency, whatever.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.910
So it really the focus is on our
ability to control all of these,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.940
and that's what privacy is.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.190
It's our ability to control information
about us and in this case we're going to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.560
focus on information that is collected,
shared, used in the online world.
