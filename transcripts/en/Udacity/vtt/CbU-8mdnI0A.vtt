00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.300
So going about and finding
co-founders is a lot like dating.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.270
You want to press the flesh and
leverage your social network and

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.330
find out who your friends know and
who their friends know, but maybe not so

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.420
much in a social sense but in a business
sense which businesses do you know?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.100
Who do you respect in
these companies and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.460
who can refer you to
the right kind of people?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.030
And when you meet them it's a lot like a
date, you are evaluating each other for

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.320
a potential match and a commitment
that's on par with marriage.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.790
Because when you actually go into
business with somebody as a co-founder,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.440
it is a bonded commitment.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.640
You're spending the majority
of your time with this person,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.220
you are looking in the same
direction as the these people or

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.470
this person and
you're all committed to the same thing.
