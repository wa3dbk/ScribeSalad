00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.180
So let's take a look at the code for

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.700
the updated query. So here's the query I had from

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.950
before, I just comment it out, so we can

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.070
keep it parked. But, here's the query where we get

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.630
all the conferences, and then we filter by city

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.335
equals Tokyo. To get conferences where there are more than

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:21.620
zero, but less than ten seats available, we need

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.310
to add two inequality filters for seats available. It's okay

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.830
to do that. You can't have inequality filters for

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.660
more than one property in a single query. But you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.390
can have multiple inequality filters for the same property. So

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.930
first we filter for seats available greater than zero. And

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.510
then we filter again for seats available, less than

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.530
ten. Since we to add sort orders we must first

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.650
sort on seats available, because that's a property with the

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.490
inequality filters. Then we can add other sort orders for

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.600
name, and for month. If we weren't doing any sorting

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.440
at all, we could just leave off all the calls

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.180
to order. You only need to make sure the sort

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.220
order for the property with the inequality filter comes first, if

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.770
you're sorting results at all. And again, if you wanted

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.850
to go ahead and actually test this, you're going to need

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.690
to make sure that you've got some conferences that are

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.210
in Tokyo with between zero and nine seats available inclusive. Actually

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.360
I guess that's not that difficult a

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.000
criteria. Conferences in Tokyo with five seats available.
