00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.631
Simplifying this expression is really just
2 instances of using the distributive

00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:09.498
property. Let's multiply each term inside
this 1st set of parentheses by 3. And we

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.035
want to multiply each term within the
2nd set of parentheses by 150. And now

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:18.389
we just multiply within each term to
simplify. And last, but not least, we add

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:24.505
like terms and we end up with a final
answer of 402w + 480n. This is

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:28.700
interesting. We can see finally, now that
everything is simplified, how the number

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.123
of nozzles that have been ordered compares
to the number of wipers that have been

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:36.176
ordered. Before, when we just had 84w +
60n, as Grant's total future earnings,

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:40.396
there were clearly more wipers than
nozzles in demand. But now the situation

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:44.884
is reversed. More novels have been ordered
than wipers. This is one of the many

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:47.842
reasons why simplifying expressions is
really, really helpful when we're doing

00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:51.156
word problems. When we have things
simplified down as much as we can, we're

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:54.561
able to see what real word situations are
reflected by the math.
