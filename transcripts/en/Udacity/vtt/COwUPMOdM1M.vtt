00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.172
In this problem we wanted to find the maximum volume, and we successfully did

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.380
that. We found the coordinates of this top point for this portion of the curve.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.460
Finding maximum and minimum is something we're often interested in, in math.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.681
It's a matter of identifying the point on a graph that is highest or lowest on

00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:20.931
the vertical axis. In a given area of the domain. So what is the minimum of this

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:24.894
function? Please fill in the two blanks right here. Tell me first what the

00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:28.926
minimum value of the function is, where we can tell the value of the function

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:33.022
based on the vertical axis here, which represents f of x, and tell me then what

00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:35.019
the x coordinate of this maximum is.
