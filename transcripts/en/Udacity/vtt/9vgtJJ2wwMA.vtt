00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.220
Now let's look at another whole concept.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.250
And that is the use of a CMOS sensor.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.910
CMOS stands for Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.700
again, has a lot of things that it has learned from CCD.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.680
But a CMOS, of course, is a little cheaper.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.950
And it's something which actually you will be, you're using all the time

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.129
because most of the cameras, the small cameras that you see and in fact,

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:29.700
in the high end cameras, now all move to using CMOS sensors as opposed to CCDs.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.100
Here are a few interesting differences between CCDs verses CMOS sensors.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.030
One thing to note is,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.010
of course, as we talked about before, there are these Bayer patterns.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.530
But ben, beneath the Bayer patterns are these photo diodes.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.655
We can refer to all of them as basically photosites.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.680
This is where, of course, information is captured and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.530
converted into light intensities and colors.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.510
So these regions are the photosites for either one of them.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.180
Basically, any one of these regions is a photosite.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.770
And we want to be able to capture information from these photosites.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.710
So the big difference is, the photosites in a CCD are passive and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.920
actually do no work whatsoever.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.520
As soon as something is captured, information is then moved over, and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.910
there is an amplifier that's used to kind of take the exact values and

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.950
amplify it to a scale that can be measured by the storage device that comes in.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.080
So I'm just showing an example of how things are copied over, one row at a time,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.560
and then saved.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.140
Photosites in CMOS actually have an amplifier right there.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.370
And actually they can do local processing.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.590
So the readout at each and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.830
every one of them is local as opposed to in this case, not really global, but

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.070
actually it's done after all the things have been stored.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.510
Here, every readout is done at the local sensor itself.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.070
So in essence, there is a small local amplifier at each and

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.010
every one of the photosites.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.230
So each and every point here, every photosite has its own amplifier.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.170
So, of course, that allows them to do local processing.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.669
One thing to note here is this is one of the traditional problems.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.966
If you play around with the video on your hand held camera or

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:17.930
a cell phone camera, you see something called a rolling shutter artifact.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.790
We'll actually, in one of the applications,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.810
talk about how we can get a rolling shutter.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.910
It's something which we've done a lot of research on.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.820
But basically one of the reasons for rolling shutter is because of

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.810
the readout that's happening at each and every photosite,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.200
if the camera is moving faster than the readout is, you will see some sort of

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.020
rolling artifacts, some non-rigidity in a scene, or some bending of the scene.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.380
That is just because when this thing is read, by the time this is read,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.020
the scene may have changed, and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.890
that is an artifact that's common in, especially lower end CMOS sensors.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.010
Higher end ones have a much faster readout rate and can do much better.
