00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.250
Now that you know about branches and reachability, you know everything you

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.560
need to, in order to understand the entire detached head message we saw earlier.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.290
Remember, to get this message, we checked out a commit, not a branch.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.660
Remember that head just means current commit.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.750
So head now points to this commit.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.630
First git says that you can look around and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.950
make experimental changes and commit them.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.250
You now know that git's history can be non-linear.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.990
So if you commit changes, they would look like what we saw before, here, and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.920
head would get updated to the commit that you just made.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.940
Next, it says that you can discard any commits that you make in this state

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.040
without impacting any branches.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.300
Since this commit isn't included in any branches, it won't show up in git log.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.570
It's not reachable and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.790
the changes made here don't show up in any of the branches.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.960
And like we said before, if you then checked out an actual branch,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.060
it would basically be like this commit never existed.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.030
The next bit says that if you want to create a new branch to retain these

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.900
commits you can do so by using this command.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.580
Git checkout -b new_branch_name.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.280
Running git checkout -b is equivalent to running two commands.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.069
First, its just like running git branch new_branch_name and

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.140
then, running git checkout on that new branch.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.990
Since this sequence of commands is something that people will want to do pretty

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.830
often, pretty much every time you're making a new feature,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.860
it's nice that there's this shortcut for it.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.120
If we do either version of these commands while we're still on this commit,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.960
then the new branch would be created here.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.600
Then any further commits will be on this new branch,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.910
since we already know that making new commits brings the branch with us.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.680
This last line just reminds us what commit we're on, making at as a shortened

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.560
version of the commit ID, and then tells us what the commit message was.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.510
Great, now you understand the entire warning.
