00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.622
&gt;&gt; What's a way to put the standard deviation in words? Just to warn you, this

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:09.191
is going to be a really tricky quiz. Maybe read them out loud slowly. You'll

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:14.001
have to think about each one, but this will really help you understand what the

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.988
standard deviation is. Are you ready? Here are your options. More than one of

00:00:18.988 --> 00:00:24.159
these could be correct. I put parentheses to specify the procedure. So, for

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:29.407
example, with this one here, I could have put parentheses around just some of

00:00:29.407 --> 00:00:34.983
absolute deviations, which would mean you find each absolute deviation, you sum

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:40.297
them up, and then you square it. But instead I put the parentheses here, which

00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:45.545
means you take the absolute deviation, you square each one, and then you take

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:50.995
the sum. This one's a little more complicated. This basically means that you sum

00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:56.017
each square deviation, then you divide it by n, and then you take the square

00:00:56.017 --> 00:01:00.961
root. So this will be very tricky. Go through each one of them and try and see

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.830
if it'll give you the same thing as the standard deviation formula here. Good

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.190
luck.
