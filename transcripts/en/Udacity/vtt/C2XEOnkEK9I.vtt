00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.380
Personality research consistently shows, that different personalities prefer

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.110
different careers and college majors. In fact, college counseling centers often

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.850
administer one personality questionnaire When trying to guide students, we are

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.919
still searching for a career that fits them. That questionnaire is Myers-Briggs

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.360
type indicator, or the MBTI for short. The MBTI consists of opposing

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.030
personality types. Extraversion and intraversion. Thinking and feeling.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.793
Intuition and sensing. In judging and perceiving. In other words people are

00:00:35.793 --> 00:00:41.025
classified, either as an extrovert or an introvert. Or as a thinker or as a

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:46.002
feeler, and so on. For example, intuition and sensing describes how people

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:51.890
prefer to take in information, focused on what is real and actual. So sensing.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.032
Or on patterns and meanings and data. So intuition. Whereas thinking and

00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:02.384
feeling describes how people prefer to make decisions based on logical analysis

00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:06.672
to thinking, or prefer making decisions guided by the concern for the emotional

00:01:06.672 --> 00:01:13.620
impact it has on others. So feeling. Now, personality types are different than

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.100
forms of dimensions because they categorize people as either one type or the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.860
other. Rather than on the continuum from high to low, like we see with the big

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.612
five. Researchers using the MBTI have found that extraverts prefers social and

00:01:29.612 --> 00:01:35.977
enterprising major such as physiology or social work even elementary education.

00:01:35.977 --> 00:01:40.393
Whereas thinking types prefer realistic and investigative majors such as,

00:01:40.393 --> 00:01:46.725
mechanical engineering or archaeology. Feeling types prefer artistic and social

00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:50.369
majors such as art, music or theater.
