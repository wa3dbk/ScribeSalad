00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When I look at an existing market, it's clear that if you've match those market needs,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you could be achieving profitability the soonest.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you're doing a clone market--that is copying a US business model in a foreign country,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that probably is the second closest to immediate profitability because you know the market exist

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that you just need to implement it in your local country.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Resegmented market--well, that's probably somewhere in between existing in clone and new

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
because you not only have to understand the market you have to understand

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the customer's specific needs or low-cost needs.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But the longest time to profitability is a new market.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You have a vision that you understand what the future might look like, but the market

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
just hasn't adapted yet and that might take years.
