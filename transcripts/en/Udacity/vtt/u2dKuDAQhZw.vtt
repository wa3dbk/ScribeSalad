00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.180
We have seen that DRAM accesses
are slow, because really we have to use

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.170
the row decoder to select the row,
then get those bits onto the bit lines,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.280
then sense what's on the bit lines,
and so on, and

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.490
only then we get the values in the row
buffer from which we can read them and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.670
send them back to the processor.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.390
But not all of the DRAM
accesses have to be that slow.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.350
So we will discuss a technique
called fast page mode,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.690
that makes some of the DRAM
accesses a lot faster than others.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.290
Remember our organization of the DRAM

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.160
with some part of
the address to select a row.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.270
That row of bits gets output
to the sense amplifier.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.160
We then latch those into the row buffer,
and then from the row buffer,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.450
we use the column address
to select a bit to output.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.050
And then, from the row buffer,
the column decoder,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.960
using the column address,
selects the actual bit to output.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.380
Note that once we have done all of this,
the row buffer can retain

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.830
the entire row, so if we want
to read a bit from the same row,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.495
we don't need to go through the whole
row address, sense amplifier,

00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:15.920
row buffer mechanism again.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.340
What we can do is simply keep what
we have in the row buffer and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.799
just change the column address.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.720
Then the bit simply gets read out of
row buffer without a new DRAM access.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.460
So this approach of finding
what we need in the row buffer

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.366
is call is fast-page mode.

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:40.970
It's not called fast-row mode just
because some people prefer to call

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.700
a memory row a page.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.950
It usually has thousands of bits,
so people call it a page.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.630
It has nothing to do with the pages
that we use for virtual memory.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.298
It's just a name for something that
has a lot of bits in this case.

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:59.230
So fast-page mode works this way.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.010
We do what is called opening up a page.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.669
That amounts to providing a row address,
selecting a row, sense amplification

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.520
of what the cells output, and latching
what we get into the row buffer.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.850
Now we can do a series of reads and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.830
writes to the page,
which really happens to the row buffer.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.770
We can read or
we can modify bits in the row buffer.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.800
Finally, when we want to do
something on another row in memory,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.430
we do what is called closing the page.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.830
We now use the sense
amplifiers to write back

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.990
to the row what we
have in our row buffer.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.630
It could be different data than what we
read because we have been modifying it

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.440
also in between.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.630
And this way if we want to do a single
read we would have to open up page,

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.300
do one read, then close up page
to write back things to our

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.800
memory cells because of
the destructive read.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.640
And then finally we have to do what is
called closing the page, which amounts

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.850
to writing the data from the row buffer
back into the row from which we read it.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.790
So if we want to do a single
memory read, we would open a page.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.120
The data is now in the row buffer,
and no longer in the row.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.310
Do the read from the row buffer and
then close the page,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.830
which causes the data to be sent
back and written back to the row.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.136
We can do a single write,
which amounts to opening a page,

00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:24.770
the data now ends up in the row buffer.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.990
We do a single write, so
we modify a bit in the row buffer, and

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.820
then we close the page which causes
the row to get the new data, and some of

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.180
the bits may not have changed, which is
why we had to read in the first place.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.760
But we can do a lot more than just
one operation in between opening and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.420
closing a page.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.900
So usually, it's advantageous to
open a page, do all the reads and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.990
writes that we can to that page before
we close the page and open another page.
