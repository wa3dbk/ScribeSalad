00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this first problem, we asked you to evaluate a few statements on interpreters.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first statement reads every operation can be sensibly applied to every type of value.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is not true. Let's take a look at the plus operator.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you add two strings, it's sensible that it concats them and it's equally sensible

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that adding two numbers is equivalent to adding them under the plus operator.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
However, adding a string and a number is not a sensible operation.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This doesn't really make sense--what we would do with this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Do we turn string into a number and add them arithmatically or do we concat "uda"

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
with the 5 and get a new string? In most interpreters, this is a problem.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The second statement reads--the meaning of an expression can depend on its context.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is true. At its core, this question is dealing with the notion of scope.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Let me show you an example in Python.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If I run this code, two values will be printed out--first 6 and then 5.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Because within the function, we defined x to be 6 and then print it out the value 6,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but outside of the function, the meaning of x is 5.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This implies that x--the expression just x--can mean two different things and its value is

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
dependent on the context it's in, whether it's in a function or outside a function

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or more precisely the scope of x.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Statement 3 reads--we can use a single dictionary as an environment

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to track JavaScript variables--this is false.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
As we saw in lecture it's necessary to use different dictionaries for different levels of scope.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Here you have a diagram of one possible environment.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Within a function named fun, x can equal the string Andy, whereas in the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
global environment, x can be the outside x string.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We generally represent each of these environments as a dictionary where the key

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
is the name and the value, and the value of that entry in the dictionary

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
is the value of the variable.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Because the name can be repeated and because a dictionary

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
has unique keys, we're going to have to have nested dictionaries

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
or more than one dictionary to easily represent our environments.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In theory, you could do it with a single dictionary, but also in theory

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
you can only use a single flat list for every program you possibly want to write.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But in practice you're going to need multiple dictionaries.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The next statement reads our JavaScript interpreter always completes

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
after recursively walking the parse tree--this is false.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The easiest way to demonstrate this is a little bit of JavaScript.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Here you have a little bit of JavaScript that never terminates.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Although the parse tree for this JavaScript is finite, interpreting it is infinite.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The way we interpret JavaScript is by running it, and in the process of running it,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we're never going to exit this while loop because the condition is true.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You may ask yourself, can our JavaScript interpreter recognize that this while loop

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
will never finish and simply skip it or somehow move on from it or just terminate early.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Well, although we can tell in this case that the while loop is never going to exit because it's true

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and then nowhere inside the loop we change the control flow.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In practice and in theory, doing this for the general case is impossible

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
due to the halting problem which we discussed in lecture.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The last statement states our HTML interpreter

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
always completes after recursively walking the parse tree.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
This is true because no matter what tags we use, there is no notion of a loop

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
like we have in JavaScript.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
There is no recursive calls that can cause the HTML interpretation to take

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
an infinite amount of time and interpreting the HTML is going to be a direct function

00:03:46.000 --> 99:59:59.999
of the number of elements we have in our parse tree.
