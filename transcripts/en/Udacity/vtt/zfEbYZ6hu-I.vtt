00:00:00.302 --> 00:00:02.264
So to implement the full particle filter,

00:00:02.264 --> 00:00:05.487
the only thing is really missing is the measurement_prob function.

00:00:05.487 --> 00:00:08.865
And that's a little bit more involved because I have to

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:14.460
really compare what the exact measurement would be for any ove, overt particle.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.617
And what I sensed and compute the probability correspondence between

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:22.020
the correct measurements, and what I sensed over here.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.420
To do this, I calculate predicted measurements using the sense function.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.150
Here comes a little flag that I defined.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.290
If I set it to 0, than the sense function acts noise free.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.670
Which is what I want, it could be the measurement model.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.370
But even we you left this out, you're going to get a fine answer on my opinion.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.330
But that makes it a little bit more accurate.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.300
So that allows me to compute the exact bearings of the landmarks for

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.970
my particle.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.760
And then I can compare these correct bearings called predicted measurements

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.290
with the ones that I received.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.540
Now do this, down here, in the compute errors routine.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.820
Where I go through each measurement and in two steps,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.460
I calculated the error in bearing.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.209
First, it's the absolute difference between my measurement that I observed,

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.560
minus the predicted measurement, and there's an i at the end over here.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.940
Let's see if you can see this.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.190
Right there.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.780
And this difference might fall outside minus pi plus pi.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.640
So this line over here just brings it back

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.110
to the smallest possible value in this cyclic space of 0 to 2 pi.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.690
So adding pi, adding more load 2 times pi and I subtract pi again.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.940
So this gives me a value between minus pi and plus pi.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.980
I then pluck this error_bearing into a Gaussian.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.360
And here is my Gaussian where I squared it,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.900
I divide it by my bearing-noise squared, complete the exponential, and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.200
use my normalizer to strictly speaking of, don't really need for

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.960
the implementation, I can safely omit it because weights are self-normalized.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.550
But I left it in, so it's actually really a Gaussian.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.010
And I take this Gaussian value and multiply it up into my error function.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.270
So for each of the measurements, I multiply in one Gaussian.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.550
And the final Gaussian is my importance whether I return in this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.150
function over here.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.820
So this is not easy to implement.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.150
I hope you got it right.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.530
Scrolling further down in my code,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.340
I now implement the particle field as follows.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.320
It uses a thousand particles.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.600
And this is exactly the same routine we had before,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.960
where we generate our initial particles.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.200
Here, I set the noise for

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.730
these particles, to be bearing_noise, steering_noise and distance_noise.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.900
I don't comment out the measurement generation step, I just take the input.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.090
And then as I go further down, I just run my particle theta.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.390
This is the exact same code you're familiar with.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.590
There's a motion update,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.970
there's a measurement update, and there's a resampling step over here.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.490
All those are the same as before.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.480
And at the very end I just print the result of get_position.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.720
So if I do this for my example, here is the position I get.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.660
And I guess for, I forgot to uncommon the Robot coordinate over here.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.064
But if you look at the values over here, 7.0 is about the same as 8,

00:02:54.064 --> 00:02:58.790
49 is about the same as 48, and 4.31 is about the same as 4.35.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.609
So this particle filter,

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.836
clearly does a pretty job in estimating the forward position
