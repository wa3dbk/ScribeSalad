00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.345
Here's a perspective projection matrix. Say you multiply a point with a

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:09.450
coordinate, 3,7,0,1 by this matrix. I'll save you the effort. You get 3, 7,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.610
negative 2.2, 0. W is 0. If you try to divide negative 2 by 2 by 0 without

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.496
safety glasses on, the world ends. In fact for any point X, Y, 0, 1, we'll get

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:24.340
a W of 0. What do all of these points have in common? The points are exactly on

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.892
one of the faces of the frustum itself. The points are in the anti-frustum, a

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:31.426
mirrored frustum behind the camera. The points are on a plane parallel to the

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:35.590
near plane that goes through the origin. Or the points are behind the camera.
