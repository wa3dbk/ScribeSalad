00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.050
So the end of this lesson,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.780
I just want to quickly summarize what we have covered.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.800
I've talked about what is a digital image and

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.840
how can you make it into a computational object.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.400
We've talked about different types of formats of images, black and white, color.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.230
And I've talked about histograms and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.700
other ways of extracting simple statistics of an image.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.450
And again, we have not talked about what they would be good for, but

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.380
that's coming up soon.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.790
So, in the next lesson we will actually get into is now, once we

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.710
know what we know about images, how can we do simple processing and filtering.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.370
And actually that's where some of the interesting things that I want you to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.042
play around with actually becoming really important.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:42.000
So far in all of the lessons we've looked at right now we're just looking at

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.220
the pixel itself.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.670
We'll also be looking at what happens in the neighborhood of the pixels and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.750
how do you actually do combinations of information one pixel to the other.
