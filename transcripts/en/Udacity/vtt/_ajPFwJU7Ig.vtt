00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.589
Congratulations.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.870
At this point you've learned about the most important and

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.390
difficult language features in JavaScript, including scopes,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.930
closures, the keyword this and prototype chains.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.270
You also learned a lot of different code reuse patterns that are built on top of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.480
those features, such as function decorators and all of the major classing and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.639
subclassing patterns that are available within JavaScript.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.200
Good luck applying them throughout the rest of your Frogger project.
