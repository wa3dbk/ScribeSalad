00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.330
So here are four of the animals that David classified as birds. Let us look at

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.320
the kind of features that he examined in order to classify whether or

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.228
not an animal was a bird. He may have used several features,

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:16.143
some of which he articulated, others that he may not have articulated. So

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:20.330
whether a animal has wings? Whether it has feathers? Whether it has a beak? And

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.360
so on and so forth. One could add more features here if one wished to do so.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.140
We do classification all the time. AI agents need to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.630
do classification all the time also. Why? Why is classification so ubiquitous?
