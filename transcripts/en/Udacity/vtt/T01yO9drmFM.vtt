Developmental psychologists study how we change from the cradle to the grave.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.295
When psychology was a new science, there was a great debate. This is called the

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:12.416
nature vs nurture debate. Some psychologists believe that we were born a blank

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:15.602
slate, or the Latin term â€œtable rasa.â€  This means that our environment

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:21.559
completely dictates who we are. Environment is everything with nurture. And

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:26.585
then some psychologists believe that it's nature. Or as they like to say, the

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:30.224
world within the skin. So, on the nature side, it's everything that we're born

00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:34.237
with, like our genetics that determine who we are. However, today we know that

00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:38.966
who we are is a function of both nature and nurture. It's a really complex

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.294
interplay of these two things, and we can rarely separate the two when trying

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:45.569
to explain different aspects of development.
