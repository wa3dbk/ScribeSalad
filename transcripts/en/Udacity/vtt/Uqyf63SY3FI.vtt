If you got this as your polynomial, great work. This question was pretty tricky.

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:08.650
So don't worry if you got it wrong the first time. I've rewritten the like terms

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.820
in this line. And here's the detail that we really need to watch out for. Here

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.091
we have 3m cubed. And here, we have 2m squared. Not like terms. Just because you

00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:20.857
see two trinomials. That doesn't mean you should add each term in its

00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:25.964
corresponding position together. Sometimes, they're not like terms. When I add

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:28.881
my like terms together, I get this result.
