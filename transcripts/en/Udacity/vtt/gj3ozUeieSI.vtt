00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.566
Thinking about what we've just seen in recent graphs, how do you think the graph

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.982
of the equation y plus 3 equals the quantity x minus 2 squared, will be shifted

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:13.391
away from the graph of y equals x squared? How many units will it be shifted in

00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:18.154
the vertical direction, and how many units in which horizontal direction? Please

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:21.820
pick one choice from each of these columns to fill in each blank.
