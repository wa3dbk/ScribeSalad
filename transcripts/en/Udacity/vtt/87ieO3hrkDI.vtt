00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.860
And, obviously, the answers, are all of these.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.020
It is a pain to change. We've basically hard-coded

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.240
these percent s's here and there and we're doing

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.070
this complicated logic to put everything together. That is

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.830
zero fun. We don't get any syntax highlighting. That's

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.250
correct. Because we're putting HTML in our Python code.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.480
So, we're not dealing with HTML. We're basically dealing

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.620
with big strings. And that's really tedious to manipulate

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.170
when your editor is set up to write Python. Our code is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.910
ugly. I didn't have a whole lot of fun explaining that code

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.420
to you. I can't imagine you had a whole lot of fun

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.720
listening to me attempt to do so. We can certainly make things

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.370
a lot more clear. And it's error prone. You know if you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.990
miss one of those percent s's, you get a percent s in

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.226
your output. If you want to, you know, add extra things, it's very

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:51.040
difficult to reason about and kind of figure out what goes where.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.890
So this is, obviously, not a particularly great approach

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.590
for generating HTML from our web application. It works for

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.890
short, little things like just a simple, simple tiny

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.060
form. But anything more complicated than that is very unwieldy.
