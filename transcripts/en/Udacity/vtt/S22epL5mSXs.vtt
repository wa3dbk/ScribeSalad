00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
So now with that kind of magic function if-better we could solve all the three problems

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.920
we have looked at so far in polynomial time.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.840
We could solve vertex cover, we could solve independent set,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.740
and we could solve clique in polynomial time.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.830
Now theoretical computer scientists like to divide problems into so-called complexity classes.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.890
And a complexity class basically contains all problems that can be solved

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.140
on a given machine within a specified time or a specified memory or even both.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.200
But we're going to stick with time for now.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.650
So if we draw this as a matrix and put time here and the machine here

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.680
then so far we learned about two different types of time.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.400
We have learned about polynomial time and we have learned about exponential time,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.280
and we have the normal RAM, the model that has basically the same capabilities as any computer

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.540
that you know, and we have just learned about the RAM that has the if-better function available.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.650
Each of these fields here in the matrix is a complexity class.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.370
So this field here, for example, would contain all problems that can be solved

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.300
in exponential time on a normal RAM.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.110
So vertex cover, independent set, and clique would all be contained in this class.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.320
But of course they can also be contained in other classes and I would actually like you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.300
to figure this out as our next quiz and the question is,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.630
in which other complexity classes, so this one here, this one here, or this one here,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.870
can we put our three problems vertex cover, independent set, and clique?

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.900
And I would like you to make a check mark if you're sure

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.840
that we can put these problems into that complexity class.

00:01:31.840 --> 99:59:59.000
If you're sure that we cannot do that or if we're not certain, I want you to leave that field blank.
