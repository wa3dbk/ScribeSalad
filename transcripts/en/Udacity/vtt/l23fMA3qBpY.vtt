00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What we're going to do right now is a recurrence relation,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which is a kind of recursive mathematical function,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is a good match for this recursive algorithmic expression for Rec&lt;u&gt;Russian--&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Rec&lt;u&gt;Russian recurrence relation.&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Looking at the structure of Rec&lt;u&gt;Russian, if a is 0, then it's going to execute 1 statement--&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
basically the test to see whether it’s 0 and returns.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Otherwise, if a is bigger than 0 and even, let's take a look at what Rec&lt;u&gt;Russian does in that case.&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We come in here with a number that is even and greater than 0 is going to execute

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the condition of this if statement, which fails so there's 1 of that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Then 1 more to do this plus it's going to recursively workout the value of this quantity.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Then one more operation to multiply that by 2.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I call a total of 3 plus however long it takes to multiply a over 2 times b.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We don't know what that is.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We're imaging that we're going be able to create a function T

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that is going to give us the answer to that.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's just leave it at that for now.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Finally, in the case where a is odd, it's going to execute the condition of this if statement,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the condition of this if statement, both of which will fail.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Then it will recursively compute the product, and then basically execute the returns.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
A total of 3 statements plus however long it takes to do the recursive call--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so 3 statements plus this particular kind of recursive call.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This now is a mathematical specification of a function.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We don't know at the moment what the relationship is between a and T(a),

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but at least it's fully specified.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It turns out that you actually can solve this pretty easily

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
by using what we already worked out about the number of times

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
you can divide a number a in half, rounding down if it's odd,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
before you get down to 0.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
See if you can put that together to try to answer the question

00:01:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what does T(a) equal from these set of choices.
