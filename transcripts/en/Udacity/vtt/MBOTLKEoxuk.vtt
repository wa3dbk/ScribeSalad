00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.840
So the structured knowledge for a presentation called script has six parts to

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.800
it. The first part is called entry conditions. These are the conditions

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.460
necessary to execute the script. So, for a restaurant script, as an example,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.190
the entry condition might be that there is a customer who is hungry and

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.143
the customer has some money. The result refers to the conditions that will

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:24.180
become true, after the script has occurred, after it has taken place. So, for

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.510
restaurant script, the result might be that the owner of some restaurant has

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.729
more money, the customer has less money, and the customer is now pleased and

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:37.240
is no longer hungry. So the third part of a script is our props. So

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.320
the third part of script are called props. Props are the kind of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.150
objects that are involved in the execution of this script so

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.030
in case of the restaurant script the props might include tables and

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.290
menus and food items and so on. So the fourth part of a script is roles.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.890
These are the agents involved in the execution of the script. As an example in

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.390
the restaurant script it might be a customer who goes to a restaurant,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.470
the owner of the restaurant, the waiter or the waitresses in the restaurant, and

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.560
so on. The fifth element of a script is a track. Track are variations or

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.850
subclasses of a particular script. So for example in case of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.690
the restaurant script we may have tracks for going to a coffee house, or

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.440
going to a fast food restaurant, or to a fine dining house. And

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.400
finally the sixth element of a script refers to scenes. Scenes are specific

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.980
sequence of events that occur during the execution of the script. So in case of

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.430
the restaurant script there might be a scene for entering a restaurant. And

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.040
a scene for ordering food. And a third scene for accepting the food and so on.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.710
When you put all of the six elements together then you get a complete script.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.570
In the previous lesson we had taken the metaphor of a molecule as a knowledge

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.930
representation. That is, knowledge representations that are not small or short

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.080
or not atomic, but are molecule in nature, script is a big, large molecule.
