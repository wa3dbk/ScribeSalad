The argument is birthday, and the return value is int. The argument goes in the

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.800
parentheses and is used in the days from method. The return value of the days

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.180
from method is then put into the variable daysOld. daysOld holds int, so the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.855
return value must be an int.
