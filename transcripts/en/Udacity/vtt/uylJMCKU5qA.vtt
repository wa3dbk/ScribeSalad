00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.200
This next demo will characterize
the effect of choosing to augment by

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.171
a shortest path.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:10.964
We'll let M be a matching and we'll let
P be a shortest augmenting path for

00:00:10.964 --> 00:00:16.024
M and then we'll let Q be an augmenting
path for M augmented by P.

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:21.113
Well, then the size of Q is at
least the size of P plus twice

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:26.324
the overlap between P and
Q in terms of the number of edges.

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:31.731
For the proof, we first observe
that the size M augmented by P and

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:37.654
augmented by Q minus the size of
the original matching M is equal to 2.

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:42.036
So the symmetric difference
between the augmented version and

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:47.326
the original, which is also equal to
the symmetric difference between P and

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:52.549
Q must contain two vertex-disjoint
augmenting paths of length at most P.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.151
They couldn't be shorter than P.

00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:56.760
Otherwise, P wouldn't
be as short as path.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.650
Therefore, the total number of edges in
the symmetric difference between P and

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.120
Q is at least twice the size of P.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.090
Now the size of Q plus the size
of P is the size of what is in

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.340
exactly one of the two plus twice
the size of what is in both.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.470
You can think about the overlap
being counted once in P and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.540
once in Q, but
not at all in the symmetric difference.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.740
Well then, applying our bound on
the size of the symmetric difference

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.500
between P and Q.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.235
We then have that this is at most,

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:35.532
twice the size of P + 2 times
the overlap of P and Q and

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:41.033
subtracting off the size of P from
both sides gives us the theorem.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:45.710
A corollary of this lemma is that
if P and Q are the same size,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.718
then they have to be vertex disjoint.

00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:51.759
The fact that they are edge
disjoint follows directly from

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.048
this equation to argue that they
have to be vertex-disjoint,

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:59.140
we'll argue that sharing
a vertex implies sharing an edge.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.250
So let's take this theorem and suppose
not, we'll let v be a shared vertex.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.508
Well then, v has to be matched
in M augmented by P, so

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:12.800
Q must share the matched edge with P.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.060
We can visualize this argument by
drawing P with the original matching M.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.120
Then once we've augmented,
P becomes like so.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.760
And regardless of what vertex
the path Q happened to share with it,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.260
that vertex is now matched and
augmented by P.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.240
So Q has to follow that edge, but
then Q and P share an edge and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.460
Q is greater than P by at least two and
that then leads to a contradiction.
