00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And you could do the intuition thing which is you can look at this

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and arrive at the point that there's no correlation and this is correct.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's a little bit tricky, but you can see x go up from 3 to 4 and y shrinks.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Then it goes from 4 to 5--the opposite happens to y, and it increases by the same amount.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That means in our data set, it will look as follows--up, down and up, and then they happens

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we already saw the best fit is the horizontal line, and the horizontal line just means

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
x and y are completely independent for this best linear fit.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Knowing x does nothing about y and knowing y does nothing about x,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and this kind of independence leads to a coefficient of 0.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's check it. What's the field over here? It's 0. It's 0 because -1+ 0+1=0,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's interesting even though this field over here ends up to be 6, 1²+2²+1².

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Zero of anything gives us a 0 at the end. So let's look at one final case.
