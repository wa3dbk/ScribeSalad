00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
For this problem we have a function clique,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and we want to know how many units of time does it take to execute clique(4).

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
To count the time, count each print statement as 1 unit

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and count each time range is evaluated as 1 unit.
