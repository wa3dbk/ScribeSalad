00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One last thing and we've been avoiding bringing this up until now,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but it's something you as an entrepreneur should know, it's a secret.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And it's a secret that we didn't even understand for a long time and that secret is

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
there are four types of startups and not knowing which type you are can really sink your company.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So we call this market type. It turns out that there really are four types of markets for startups.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
One is existing market. Another is where you take a segment or re-segment an existing market.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Another is a new market and another is a clone market.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So let's take a look why this is important and then we'll give you the definition of each one.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It turns out that the type of market changes everything.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It changes your initial market size, how much it cost to enter the market,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
what kind of launch you do with your product, it affects the type of competitive barriers you have,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and how you position or describe your product.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It affects your sales model. Are you going to hire direct sales? When do you hire them?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What kind of margins you should have or the profits?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
How long it takes, that is the sale cycle and something called the chasm width,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which we'll take a look in a sec.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It also affects how much money you're going to need to raise

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and how long it takes to get the profitability and then finally, it affects the types of customers

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and what they're needs are and how long it takes to adapt?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So, what are the things this looks like is just a checklist of market type seems to affect everything.

00:01:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What the heck can it be? So let's go a little further and define.
