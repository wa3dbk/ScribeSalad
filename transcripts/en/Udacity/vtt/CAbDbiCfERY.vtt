00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.850
Next let's try inserting an element.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.290
We could take the approach we used with
BST's, start at the root then move

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.740
down the tree one level at a time and do
comparisons until we find an open spot.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.880
However, if our element is bigger
than most of the parent nodes or

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.990
even the root we'll need to
shuffle the tree around a lot.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.400
As such, we take a different
approach to inserting here.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.900
We can stick the new element in
the next open spot in the tree.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.660
Then we heapify.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.299
Heapify is the operation in
which we reorder the tree

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.230
based on the heap property.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.990
Since we care that our parent
element is bigger than its child,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.520
we just need to keep comparing our
new element with its parent and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.260
swapping them when the child is bigger.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.530
We can take a similar approach
to an extract operation

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.980
where the root is removed from the tree.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.190
We stick the rightmost
leaf in the root spot

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.739
then just compare it to its children and
swap where necessary.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.300
The runtime of insert and delete,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.630
a more general case of extract ends
up being O of log in the worst case.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.600
Ultimately the worst case would involve
moving an element all the way up or down

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.839
the tree and would roughly be as many
operations as the height of the tree.
