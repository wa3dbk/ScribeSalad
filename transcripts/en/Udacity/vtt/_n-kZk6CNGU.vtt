00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.417
When thinking about an expression that includes an exponent, let's start with

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.650
one of these squares. I have a 2 by 2 square. I know I can write 2 times 2 as 2

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:12.957
squared, but, I don't have one square in my book of stamps, I have five, so, I

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.189
need to multiply this by 5. This would be the amount of stamps on one book of

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:21.970
stamps, but I have two books of stamps. So, we multiply this expression by 2. If

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:26.225
you chose the first one, nice work. This was a pretty tough quiz, so just hang

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:29.680
in there and keep trying with these order of operation problems.
