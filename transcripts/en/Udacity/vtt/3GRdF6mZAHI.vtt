00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; So I said that there'll be three potential general models left after

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.760
specializing and pruning. Those three models are going to be

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.120
that I could just be allergic to everything at Kim's, I could just always be

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.070
allergic to breakfast, or I could just be allergic to eating on Friday.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.150
I would prune the ones based on cost and whether or not the meal is vegan,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.150
because although I've had bad reactions to cheap, non-vegan meals in the past,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.690
here I didn't have a reaction to a cheap, non-vegan meal. So it's not sufficient

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.930
to say I'm allergic to everything non-vegan or I'm allergic to all cheap food.
