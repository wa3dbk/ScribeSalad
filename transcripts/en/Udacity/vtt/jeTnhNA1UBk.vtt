00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.470
Recall our terminology for describing architecture in terms of components,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.840
connectors and configurations. The components are mainly determined by

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.570
the system's functionality, with a few invented to handle non,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.640
some non-functional requirements. Now it's time to take a look at connectors.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.430
The main material for this lesson comes from the [UNKNOWN] paper,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.068
which I have asked you to read. There is also some material in

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:29.380
the optional text by Taylor [UNKNOWN] on software architecture foundations.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.820
According to Shaw and Garlan, connectors are responsible for

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.010
mediating the interactions among the components. They establish the rules that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.430
govern component interaction and specify any auxiliary mechanisms required.
