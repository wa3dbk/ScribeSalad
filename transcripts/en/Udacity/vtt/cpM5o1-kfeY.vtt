To help me make the point about what a digital image is,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.860
here I've taken a sample image of the Georgia Tech mascot Buzz,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.930
in of course his wonderful, colorful glory here.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.960
What we interested in now actually start looking at and easing apart

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.100
various aspect of an image, for example, a square image like this one.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.160
Just to help us along, I've actually converted this image into a grayscale

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.800
image, which basically means that the whole image is now represented not in

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.710
color, but just the different aspects of the gray values of an image,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.772
the basically, the range from a white pixel or white color, to a black color.

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:41.220
And this basically now is showing a black and white or a gray-scale image.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.350
Now, mostly we will be looking at these images and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.700
trying to represent them in a coordinate space here.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.970
I'm referring to the x and

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.690
y coordinate space, which basically allows us to be able to traverse this image

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.470
in this axis which is x, and in this axis which is y.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.534
And the interest in doing this is because now I'll be able to kind of

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:02.950
count down in some instances.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.620
If you start thinking of this as basically different columns and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.720
different rows of the image.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.950
So I'd go down each and every column, until I come here, wrap around and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.170
I would actually start looking for other columns going down row by row.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.780
So this is one of the representations we want to start looking at, and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.250
how do we best kind of represent and image in a form that allows us to,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.630
in a raster scan format, traverse each and every element of that image.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.650
So now that we know the axes of this image,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.760
let's look at the dimensions of this image.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.320
So here, I show you the whole box that represents this image.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.300
And of course the easiest way to reference this box would be through width and

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.840
the height of the image.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.160
Width represents the number of columns that would exist in this image,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.530
and the height represents the number of rows that represent this image.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.320
This is a square image, a classic image, and each of the basic width of this im,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.169
image is 512 pixels and the height is 512 pixels.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:15.110
And if you just do the simple math of trying to take 512 width and 500 high,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.970
512 pixels height you basically get an image that has about 262,000 pixels.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.910
And this converts it into a 0.26 megapixel image.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.420
And this is an approximate number of pixels, megapixels this image has.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.500
So, this is basically one of the ways of,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.490
the simplest ways of representing an image where we need to know the width and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.410
the height and how we'd be traversing it.
