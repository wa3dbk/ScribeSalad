So I have one final question here.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.939
Suppose this is an alarm system and true means or

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:06.740
positive means there's a burglar in your house.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.032
What box, what type of events and

00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:16.260
these would you think best characterizes a false alarm of the alarm system?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.590
So click on those four boxes and tell me which ones are false alarms
