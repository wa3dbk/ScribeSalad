00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.310
So here's our problem. If we try to see the amount

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.020
of users in each age group, it's not in order and

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.610
it's hard to compare immediately. This problem is even more noticeable

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.770
on a different plot. If we try to create the same

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.540
plot for users in each income bracket, we see a very

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.750
similar problem. And here it's much worse. These first two bins

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.500
are for a 100,000 and over 150,000. And this last bin

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.110
is for people who make under 20,000. Our eyes tend to read

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.010
pages from left to right, so this graph is pretty hard to

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.630
interpret. Or even better said, it'd be very hard to make comparisons

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.460
naturally with our eye. We have to always scan down to the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.450
bottom to figure out what group we're in. So let's order the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.030
factors in our age.range variable. What I want you to do is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.680
to look up the documentation for the factor function. Or you can

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.580
read through the example that we've linked in the instructor notes. Once

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.190
you're ready, try to write the code in order to order the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.750
levels of this variable. And just as a

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.350
reminder, the level should take on these values.
