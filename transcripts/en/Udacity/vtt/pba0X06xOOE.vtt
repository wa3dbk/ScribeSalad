00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.540
Now that you know what
Android resources are,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.260
and that you can put them
in different folders.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.840
Let's talk about how you can actually
access the resources that you saved in

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.580
those folders.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.050
When your app is compiled,
there's a tool in Android called AAPT.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.610
And that generates the R class.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.840
This is simply an R.Java file, and
I'll show you an example next.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
It contains the resource IDs for all
the resources in your S directory, so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.790
for all the resources that you've added,
there's an ID to refer to it.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.000
The ID is in a format that is
based on the resource type, so for

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.640
all Java resources which are graphics it
would follow the format of R.drawable.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.805
For all strings that are resources,
it would follow the formula

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:47.850
R.string.resource name which
is hello in this case.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.230
Note there are two ways that
you can access a resource.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.720
In Java code it follows the format of
R.resource type.resource name In XML

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.820
though, it follows the at notation, so
it would be at and then the resource

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.050
type would be string slash, and
then the resource name, which is hello.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.730
Here are more examples of different
resource types and how to access them.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.430
These are just a couple of
the common resource types,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.660
but there are many others.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.590
You always start with R, a dot,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.180
and then resource type, a dot,
and then the resource name.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.350
And the name is whatever you assign it.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.610
And then in XML you have @ and
then the resource type, slash,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.790
and then the name of the resource.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.640
Let's take a moment to find
all the resource IDs in

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.620
our main activity Java file.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.160
I'm going to open up the find
command in Android Studio.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.640
I'm going to use Cmd+F, or
you can use Ctrl+F if you're on Windows.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.460
It pops up a search field here.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.910
I'm going to search for
capital R dot, and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.430
then click on match case, so
that it only grabs the capital R cases.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.650
The first thing it finds is this
r.layout.activity_main reference.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.420
This is interesting because we're
referring to the activity main

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.710
layout file.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.170
This is actually how the main activity
knows to load up this XML file.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.390
Isn't that cool?

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.639
Let's look at the next reference.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.440
Okay.
In the displayQuantity method,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.360
we have a reference to
R.id.quantity_text_view.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.270
So this is referring to a ViewId.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.120
Specifically, the TextView
that displays the quantity.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.660
Hopefully some of the puzzle
pieces are coming together.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.220
By referring to this
view in the Java code.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.550
We can update it while the app is
running to show this numberOfCoffees.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.720
Let's go to the next occurance.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.520
OK in the displayMessage

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.470
method we see a reference to
R.id.order_summary_text_view.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.530
Here it seems like we're trying to
refer to this text view which displays

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.210
the order summary, so
that we can update it with this message.
