00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's talk about how we might implement the shortest<u>dist</u>node function.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We give it all the distances we've calculated so far for all the nodes that we could do that for

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and so that's just a big pile here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There is a bunch of nodes and for each node, we have some value

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and a lot of these values are temporarily assigned and they may actually change later,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but what we want to know is which of these we'd like to pull out the smallest value

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then we'd actually like to lead it from this set

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so we don't have to worry about getting the same value over and over and over again

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The next time we want to go in here we want to get the next smallest.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
How many different values might be in this blob?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, there can be at most one for each node then probably less.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There is probably lots of nodes that haven't been added in yet,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but at worst, it's going to be Î¸(n).

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The nodes that are in the graph may have distances associated with them.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
To get the smallest distance in here, the nature thing to do is to loop through the list.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Take all the distances that we actually have at the moment

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
just loop through them and pull out the minimum, easy Î¸(n)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and in fact, that's what I implemented here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The shortest<u>dist</u>node, you give it a mapping distances

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and it starts off with the best node undefined and best value something big

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
from probably really want something bigger than this and for all the nodes that we have distances for

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If the distance for that node is better than the best we've seen so far, reassign

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and when you're done, just return the best node.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is really quite straightforward and what is the running time that this leads to?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
These are some tricky run times than the ones I've suggested in the past.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We've got n nodes and m edges, and we want to know,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
if we implement the dijkstra algorithm with looping through the list to find the smallest value.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What is the running time that we get? Just make the selection.
