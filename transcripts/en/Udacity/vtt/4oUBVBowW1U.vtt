00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.910
With our previous discussion
of the classes, P and

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.210
NP in mind,
you can visualize the classes like this.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.381
Clearly P is contained inside of NP.

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.310
And we're pretty sure that
this containment is strict.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.629
That is to say there are some
problems in NP but not in P.

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:19.871
Where the answer can be
verified efficiently, but

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:22.200
it can't be found efficiently.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.610
But no one knows how to prove this yet.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.790
In this picture then, you can imagine
the harder problems being at the top.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.760
Now, suppose for

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.560
a moment that you encounter some problem
where you know how to verify the answer

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.800
but where you think that finding
an answer is intractable.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.456
Unfortunately, you boss or maybe your
advisor doesn't agree with you, and

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:43.434
keeps asking for an efficient solution.

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:47.080
How would you go about showing that
the problem is, in fact, intractable?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.610
One idea is to show that
the problem is not in P.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.853
That would indeed show that it is not
intractable, but it would do much more.

00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:58.083
It would show that P is not equal to NP.

00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.870
You would be famous.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.480
As we talked about in the last lecture,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.730
whether P is equal to NP is one of
the great open questions in mathematics.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.620
So I'm going to cross that out.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.447
I don't want to discourage you
from trying to prove this theorem

00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:10.720
necessarily.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.760
You should just know
what you're getting into.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.410
Another option is to reduce another
intractable problem to your problem.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.200
If you were working in the early or
mid-1970s,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.280
you might have reduced linear
programming to your problem.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.950
Practical methods for solving some
linear programs were available, but

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.900
most people thought that in general
it was not polynomially solvable.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.000
Since the solution to your problem
would solve any linear program

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.980
your problem must be harder.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.800
The trouble with this approach is
that it was later shown that linear

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.180
programming actually was
polynomially solvable.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.480
Hence the fact that your problem
is as hard as linear programming

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.260
doesn't mean much anymore.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.940
The Class P swallowed
linear programming.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.680
Why couldn't it swallow your program,
as well?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.020
This type of argument isn't worthless,
but

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.290
it's not as convincing as it might be.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.070
It would be much better
to reduce your problem

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.720
to a problem that we knew was
one of the hardest in NP.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.335
So hard that if P were to swallow it,

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:09.621
it would've had to have
swallowed all of NP.

00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:10.441
In other words,

00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:13.380
it would have to move this line
here all the way up to the top.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.280
Such a problem would
have to be NP complete.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.130
Meaning that we can reduce
every language in NP to it.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.840
Remarkable as it may seem, it turns
out there are lots of such languages,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.080
satisfiability being the first one for
which this was proved.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.760
In other words, we know that it has
to be at the top of this image.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.546
Turning back to how to show that
your problem is intractable.

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:41.707
Short of proving that P is not equal
to NP, the best we can do is reduce

00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:45.680
an NP-complete problem
like SAT to your problem.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.740
Then your problem would
also be NP-complete and

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.730
the only way that your problem could
be polynomially solvable is if

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.090
this line moves up here and everything
in NP Is polynomially solvable.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.900
There are two parts to this argument.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.330
The first is the idea of
a polynomial reduction.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.603
We've seen reductions before in
the context of computability.

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:08.843
Here, are the reductions we not
only have to be computable, but

00:03:08.843 --> 00:03:11.400
to be computable in polynomial time.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.540
This idea will occupy
the first half of the lesson.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.170
The second half, we'll consider
this idea of NP completeness and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.400
we'll go over the famous
Cook-Levin theorem.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.234
Which showed that bouillon
satisfiability is NP-complete
