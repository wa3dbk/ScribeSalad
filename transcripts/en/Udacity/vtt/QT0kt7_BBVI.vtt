00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here is a diagram representing our counter mode hash function.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The counter is encrypted using the key,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is then XORed with the message to produce the first cipher block.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And this is repeated for the second cipher block, et cetera.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then each cipher block is XORed together to produce our hash value.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
One way of creating a collision is to swap 2 of the cipher blocks.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For example, the first 2.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We can write this new hash as hash prime,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and it should be obvious that hash = hash prime.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now let's look back at our diagram,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and for notation, let's refer to the value

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
coming out of the encryption as E0 and E1.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Then we have M0 XORed with E0 = C0

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and M1 XORed with E1 = C1.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And we want to find M0 prime and M1 prime

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
such that when XORed with E0 you get C1,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and when XORed with E1, you get C0.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We can calculate M0 prime by first calculating E0 by reversing out the XOR

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and then XORing E0 with C1 to get what we want.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, in the code, here is a swap blocks routine

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that calculates the 2 message blocks needed by first calculating

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the eblock by reversing out the XOR

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and then applying the XOR on the eblock with this swapped cipher block

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and then returning both of them.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Here we get the inputs used for the cipher, which we then calculate.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
These next lines grab the 4 blocks we need,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and then we calculate the new message blocks,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which then get replaced into the message, which is returned.

00:01:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And then to test this, we call test, and it worked.
