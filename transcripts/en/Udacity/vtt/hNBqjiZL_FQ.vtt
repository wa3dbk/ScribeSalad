00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.238
To get some practice using navigation
controllers and storyboard,

00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:05.705
we're going to build
a Make Your Own Adventure app.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.240
It will look like this.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.445
It begins with the first
line of a story and

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:11.713
the user gets to choose
what happens next.

00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:15.034
So here we've got a tiger and
I think she should stalk to the door and

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:16.590
peek down the hallway.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.086
So we press that button and
it leads to the next part of the story.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.700
Let's work through
the steps to make this app.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.719
Even though this app
will have multiple views,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.962
I'm starting with the single view
template, because it's the simplest.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:31.540
The first thing I'll do is delete this
View Controller that was automatically

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.210
generated, then I'll drag
in a Navigation Controller.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.276
If you look in this automatically
generated Root View Controller,

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:41.075
you'll see that it has a Table View.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.077
But we don't need a Table View for
this app, so let's go ahead and

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.980
delete that as well.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.421
Then drag in another View Controller and

00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:51.519
we're going to set that to
be the Review Controller.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.517
I do that by bringing up the pop-up
menu for the Navigation Controller and

00:00:56.517 --> 00:01:01.272
dragging this Root View Controller
property to this View Controller I

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:05.540
just brought in, then I drag in
a Text View for the story text and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.579
two buttons for the choices.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.307
Making sure to set the appropriate
constants of course.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:17.710
This view is the first in a series
that have the same UI components.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.473
So, once I have this text view and
these buttons setup the way I like them,

00:01:21.473 --> 00:01:24.585
I'm just going to copy and
paste the whole View Controller.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:28.222
I can do that by drawing a rectangle
around the View Controller like this.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.865
Careful that second View Controller
appears right on top, but it is there.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.046
Once we have our two
new View Controllers,

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:43.760
we can add some more text for
the next part of the story.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.422
To segue way from one screen to the
next, I bring up the Connections menu

00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:50.244
for each button and
add a triggered segue, like this.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.458
Let's run it and
see what we've got so far.

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:04.091
Hm.

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.240
I'm getting a black screen.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.430
That's not what I want, but
I have a guess at why it's happening.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.889
I need to make sure my Navigation
Controller is set as the initial

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.300
View Controller.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.846
So, I go into my
Attributes Inspector and

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:19.407
I click this is Initial View Controller.

00:02:19.407 --> 00:02:20.470
Let's try it again.

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.320
Okay, much better.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.641
So you can see I need to adjust my to my
constraints a little bit on the buttons,

00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.919
but we've got a good start to our story.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.671
Now repeat these steps on your own and
for more details and

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.070
notes on how to polish up the app,
consult the upcoming reading node.
