00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.404
Now that we have an equation for the perimeter and an equation for the area,

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:08.089
let's try and rearrange this equation to solve it for l. We want to solve this

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.865
equation for the length, so that way, we can perform the substitution for the

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:17.506
length in this equation. We'll be able to solve this system of equation by

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:22.627
doing so. So take this equation and solve it for l. What do you think we would

00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:23.510
get here?
