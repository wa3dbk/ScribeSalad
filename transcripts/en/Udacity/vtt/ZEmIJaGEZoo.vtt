00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.969
With effort to expectation
generation just a while back

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:05.550
let's look into it more deeply.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.160
So when we actually
interact with the world

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.230
sometimes things do not happen
the way we expect them to happen.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.550
And sometimes things happen
that people are not expecting.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.110
But how do we know what to expect and
what not to expect?

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.940
So consider a situation like this.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.530
This is an instance of a script.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.400
In this particular case,
I have gone to Olive Garden.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.310
And the waiter is Andrew.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.500
So I move to a table and
I sit down at the table.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.460
And now Andrew sees me.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.460
So from my perspective, I am expecting
Andrew to come to me and give me a menu.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.659
But supposing this never happens.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.690
I am sitting there waiting for
Andrew, or someone else, to come, and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.750
no one comes.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.560
That's an expectation violation.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.630
So I know something has gone awry.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.760
The reason I know that is because
I continued expectations using

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.300
the scripts,
expectations that are never fulfilled.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.790
Now consider an alternate situation.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.160
Instead of Andrew coming to my table and
giving me a menu, Andrew comes to me and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.190
gives me a bill right away.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.320
Well I should think that I
would be surprised by that.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.380
That was an unexpected
event that occurred.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.830
Well several questions arise here.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.380
First, could this be the beginning
of theory of surprise?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.060
In both cases, we were surprised.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.640
In one case where Andrew did
not come and give a menu.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.440
In the second case, when Andrew came and
gave a bill instead of giving the menu.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.590
On second notice, a surprise,
it has two sides to it.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.640
One, when things do not happen
the way we expect them to happen.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.480
And the other,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.840
when things happen the way in which
we were not expecting them to happen.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.390
This example shows, that scripts not
only tell us what to make sense of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.980
the world around us, they also tell us
what to expect and what not to expect.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.220
And that's a powerful idea.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.630
&gt;&gt; So it seems like another example
where this happens really strongly,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.090
that we encounter fairly frequently,
is if you've ever seen a horror movie.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.760
One thing that horror
movies really do really,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.650
really well is they lure you into
expecting one thing to happen

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.810
only to throw something
completely different at you.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.830
So they lure you into kind of a false
sense of security in expecting that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.550
nothing bad is going to happen in a
particular scene, and then suddenly they

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.960
throw a ghost at you from offscreen and
it kind of startles you.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.410
And the reason it startles you is
because it violates your expectations

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.300
for what were going to happen next.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.390
&gt;&gt; David, that's a good point,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.690
that it happens in many
different kinds of movies.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.210
So when I go and
see a science fiction movie, or

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.840
even a romance movie,
I'm expecting certain things to happen.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.930
And sometimes I think a movie is
really good if it is new and novel and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.088
different and
it offers some surprising things.

00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:33.400
Notice that this could also be
the beginning of a theory of creativity.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.030
In the last lesson we were
talking about balance and humor.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.242
No we're talking about surprises.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:44.350
Some current theories of creativity say
that a situation is creative if it is A,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.930
novel, B, if it is useful or
valuable in some way, and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.000
C, if it is unexpected or surprising.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.760
Now, this begins to capture at
least one of those three dimensions

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.070
of unexpectedness or surprise,
and that's an important part.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.710
We'll return to computational
creativity at the end of this course,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.600
when we'll talk a lot
more about these issues.
