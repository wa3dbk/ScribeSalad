Hi, and welcome to my online course on computer architecture, UD-233,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.230
affectionately known as CS6290 here at Georgia Tech. I've been teaching

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.140
computer architecture for more than ten years now, and I'm now very happy to

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.620
be bringing this course to a much broader audience like this. In this course,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.770
we will learn how modern processor cores work. How these cores access memory,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.230
and how we put them together into a multicore chip. But let's start at

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.070
the beginning. You probably first want to know, what is computer architecture?
