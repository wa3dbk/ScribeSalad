00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
As I compare these 2, I would say that

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.720
Every city is visited at least once

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.250
sounds like each clause must be satisfied,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.770
so we must basically ensure that our satisfying assignment

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.500
satisfies it at least once,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.420
so I think this one here is closely related to this one down here.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.400
The main decision is the order in which to visit the cities.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.760
That is what makes this problem hard

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.050
and the analogous decision that you have to make for SAT is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.260
deciding which variables to set to true or to false,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.980
so I think these 2 are quite closely related.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.940
Then being able to visit a city more than once

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.960
but not having to do so.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.410
I think that is closely related to number 4,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.350
because what we have here is

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.840
one variable is enough to satisfy a clause,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.620
but of course, we can use more than one variable

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.480
to satisfy the clause; it doesn't hurt if there's more variables here

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.880
that will evaluate to true,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.000
so we can satisfy a clause in multiple ways,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.720
but we don't have to; one single variable is enough.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.770
And ten finally, saying that each variable

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.460
is either true or false.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.400
I think--and this is probably the hardest one to figure out--

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.500
and that is actually quite closely related to saying that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.270
you don't visit a city more than once on purpose.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.290
It means you basically have to make a decision

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140
what city to visit next,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.530
and that is, in my mind,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.690
more or less close to saying

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.600
I'm setting a variable to either true or false.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.830
Once you go along the shortest tour, you're always on your way to a new city,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.330
but again, I realize this might be a bit subjective here.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.850
Let's use this relationship to try and reduce SAT to shortest tour,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.260
and I think we should start out with this relation here.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.870
Deciding true or false is what makes SAT hard.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.530
The main decision is the order in which to visit the cities.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.510
So the important insight here is

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.840
that if we should try and find some way to represent

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.520
true or false

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.820
as an order in which cities are visited

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.110
and to assure through that order also that

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.680
you cannot have ambiguous assignment of true or false,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.870
so basically, you have to make a decision

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.340
in which order you visit the cities

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.190
and that much represent either true or false

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.300
and to figure this out, of course,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.190
that takes a lot of playing around with different networks,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.020
so even though I had learned the proof,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.150
I didn't quite remember how to do it,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.280
and it took me 15 or 20 minutes to play around

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.340
on a piece of paper with a pen to find out how it could represent

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.980
true or false variables as an order in which cities are visited,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.240
and there's many possibilities,

00:02:31.240 --> 99:59:59.000
but I'll show you what I came up with and then explain that to you.
