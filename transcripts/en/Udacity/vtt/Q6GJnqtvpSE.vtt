00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.288
By now you've seen a few different examples of composite functions. And for one

00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:10.872
pair of functions we found both, f composed with g, and g composed with f. What

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:14.768
I'm wondering is if order matters. Does it matter if f is the outer function

00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:19.025
and g is the inner function, or vice versa? In other words is the output of

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:23.096
these two composite functions the same. Well we're going to test that for a

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:26.704
bunch of different pairs of functions. In the first column over here, we have

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:31.570
what I'm going to call function one. And over here function two. For each pair,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.649
please find f of g and then g of f. And then pick whether or not they're the

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.844
same. Now I know that for some of these it doesn't actually look like we're

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:43.697
doing any math. These bottom three functions are all modeling real life

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:47.615
situations. But we can still think of them as functions. They all produce a

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.995
certain outcome and I'm wondering if the order we do these actions in, changes

00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:55.984
the final outcome of the situation. So, f of g, for this first case here, where

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:59.583
f is putting on left shoe, and g is putting on your right shoe, would mean

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:06.204
putting on your right shoe and then putting on your left shoe. Whereas g of f,

00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:09.984
would be putting on your left shoe, and then putting on your right shoe. So

00:01:09.984 --> 00:01:14.304
again, just consider if the order we apply either of these functions in,

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:17.269
affects the end situation.
