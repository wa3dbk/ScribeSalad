00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.315
Here's the last compound inequality we'll look at. Notice I have two inequity

00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:08.253
signs, and an expression with a variable in the middle. So you might be

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.521
wondering, is this an AND inequality, or an OR inequality. To think about it,

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.850
let's try splitting it up. Here's one inequality, so I'm going to write the one

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:21.460
here. And here's the second inequality. We want this amount to be greater than

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:25.430
negative 2 and we want this amount to be less than 4. So this is an AND

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:29.862
inequality. We know how to solve an AND inequality, and we could solve each of

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:34.219
these separately, but I'm going to show you something different. We're going to

00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:38.865
solve this inequality by working with each part of the inequality. All three of

00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:43.196
them. First I'm going to clear the fraction by multiplying every part by 5. 5

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:47.540
times negative 2 is negative 10. Here, I'm going to put the 5 over 1, then I'm

00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:51.796
going to reduce the common factors in the numerator and the denominator. So

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:55.569
these 5's reduce to 1. Now that you have an idea of how to perform the

00:00:55.581 --> 00:01:00.360
operations to every part, I want you to finish this one out. Write your answer

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:05.421
in interval notation in this box. Remember to use parentheses or brackets and a

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:09.366
comma to separate the numbers from the interval. Good luck.
