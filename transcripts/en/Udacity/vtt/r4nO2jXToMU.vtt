00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Something you might be wondering is do real developers 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
put assertions into the code that they write?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It turns out that often they do.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I took a quick look at the GCC and the LLVM code bases.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
GCC is the GNU compiler collection.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It contains not only the well-known C compiler and C++ compiler, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but also a Java compiler, and an Ada  compiler and a number of other tools,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the GCC source code base contains more than 9000 assertions.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, the LLVM compiler suite contains about 13,000 assertions,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that's over about 1.4 billion lines of code

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for a total of about 1 assertion per 110 lines of code.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here I'm just counting raw lines of code, not source lines of code.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This includes blanks, comments, and everything.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What this tells us is that the LLVM and GCC developers

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
have made a pretty serious commitment to checking assumptions,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
preconditions, post conditions, and invariant in the code that they wrote.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
One thing that I've done personally is reported a lot of compiler bugs

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to both the GCC and LLVM products,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and one thing I've learned is that much of the time

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
these bugs show up as assertion violations.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Not always--sometimes these compilers seg fall to have other problems.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But most of the time they're assertion violations.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
These assertions are actually succeeding at accomplishing the goals

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that we talked about on the left side of the screen here.
