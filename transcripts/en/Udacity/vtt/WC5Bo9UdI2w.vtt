00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.422
So now, let's see what happens when we do out of

00:00:02.422 --> 00:00:06.186
order load store execution. That is, we try the aggressive approach of

00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:09.114
loads going to memory as soon as they know the address, if

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:13.000
there is no preceding store that is also the same address. And

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.630
it later turns out that a store has been resolved to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.960
the same address. We have something like this: This is going to be

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.950
our sequence of instructions in the load store queue. Let's say that

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.520
we are executing these five instructions and this is their program order.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.340
First we have a load that loads from the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.130
address 0 plus R6, and puts the value into R3.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.400
Next we have an add that takes R3, adds R9 to it and puts the result to us into

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.560
R7. Next we have a store that takes the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.380
value from R4 and puts it in a memory location

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.520
determined by R7. Next we have a subtraction R1 minus

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.820
R2 goes into R1. And finally, we use R1 as

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.190
an address to access memory and put the value

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.990
into R8. In an out-of-order processor, when we try to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.375
execute these instructions, this is what might happen. Let's say,

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:04.010
that all of these have already been fetched, decoded, etc.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.120
So, let's say that the Load, because it only depends

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.230
on R6 switch. No other instruction is supposed to produce,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.340
it can dispatch. So it goes to memory and, eventually,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.120
it will come back with R3. But let's say it's

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.240
a cache miss, so it's going to take a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.620
while until this Load comes back. This instruction cannot

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.750
be dispatched until that happens. And this instruction cannot

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.740
be dispatched until that happens. In fact, the store doesn't

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.320
even know the address to which it's going to be

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.220
storing, until the add completes, which is going to happen

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.340
at some future point. Meanwhile the subtract can dispatch

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.620
and it produces R1 very quickly. At that point the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.860
load can dispatch. It has everything it needs to

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.590
know. It has the address, now it can go to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.500
memory and load from it. Let's say that the load

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.790
is cache hit, so it gets the R8 very quickly

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.410
and maybe supplies it to subsequent instructions. So at

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.590
this point in time. What we have is that the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.730
subtract and load have completed, we think we're just waiting

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.650
to commit them. The load and the add, and the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.479
store are not done yet; because they're all waiting

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.120
for the load to finish and then they can do

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.120
something. Eventually let's say that this load is done, now

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.280
we produce r 3 feed it to this add. The

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.590
add is going to be done very soon afterwards and now

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.960
we feed the R7 to the store. And now let's

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.790
say that this was some address X that we have

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.690
accessed here. If this results do not X, meaning the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.950
address addressed by R7 is not the same address as

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.800
the one addressed by R1. Then everything is going to be

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.640
fine. The store is storing to some other address, we

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.930
have loaded something else entirely and everything is fine. However,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.550
the problem occurs when the address that the store resolves

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.180
to si also x. At that point, the value from

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.470
R4 that the store is storing is really the one

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.800
that the load should have been loading, however the load

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.140
already loaded some stale value from memory.
