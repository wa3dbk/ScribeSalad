00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
So we're working with the decision version of vertex cover here.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:09.450
So as an input, we're giving a graph G with n vertices and an integer k.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.010
And the output is "yes" if G has a vertex cover of size at most k and "no" otherwise.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.030
So the first time you see this kind of use of the if-better function

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.490
it might still seem a bit strange to you so I'm going to explain to you what it does

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.890
and how we're using it here.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.970
We're using this if-better function to guess for us which vertices to put into the vertex cover

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.800
and which vertices we can leave out.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.170
Then we check if the assignment is valid although actually we wouldn't have to do that

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.420
but I'll get into that in a minute and if the size of the assignment that we have found is at most k

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.940
we say "yes, the graph has a vertex cover of size at most k and no otherwise."

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.510
So as you can see, we're putting a lot of trust into this part here of the function

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.680
because we're basically trusting the if-better to tell us correctly whether we should

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.130
put a vertex into the vertex cover or whether we shouldn't do that.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.830
And that is why I basically said that the computer that has this function available

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.730
is extremely powerful because if you can trust the if-better to do exactly what we want for us

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.590
which is guess the best possible assignment then of course this significantly changes

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.490
the running time of the algorithm here.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.450
So let's do a little quiz--what is the running time of this algorithm here for a graph with n vertices

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.480
if we can trust the if-better function to perform as specified and guess the best possible assignment

00:01:36.480 --> 99:59:59.000
of 0s and 1s to the vertices.
