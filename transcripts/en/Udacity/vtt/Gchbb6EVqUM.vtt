00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.719
The summer of 2001 essentially saw a

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.300
new era in internet security with three major

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
worm outbreaks. These three major worms were

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.560
Code Red One, version two, Code Red Two,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.200
and Nimda. Let's take a quick look at each of these worms. Code Red 1

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.600
was released on July 13th, 2001, and was

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.170
the first modern worm. It exploited a buffer

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.770
overflow in Microsoft's IIS server. From the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.040
1st through the 20th of each month, it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.350
would spread By finding new targets using a random scan of IP address space, it

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.510
would spawn 99 new threads, which generated

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.960
IP addresses at random and then looked for

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.670
vulnerable instances of IIS. Now version 2

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.450
Of code red one, was actually released six

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.290
days later and fixed that random scanning bug.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.640
So that each instance of the worm scanned

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.960
a different part of IP address space. After

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.620
the scanning bug was fixed, the worm was able

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.550
to compromise 350000 vulnerable hosts in a matter of only

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.590
14 hours. By most estimates, that was the complete set of hosts

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.650
running the vulnerable version of IAS. On the entire internet. The payload

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.630
of this worm was to mount a denial of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.900
service attack on whitehouse.gov. But a bug in the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.780
coding, caused the worm to die, on the 20th

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.500
of each month. If the victims clock was wrong however,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.220
the worm would actually resurrect itself. On the 1st.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.330
Fortunately in this case, the payload which launched the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.170
denial of service attack on whitehouse.gov actually was launched

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.000
at a particular IP address, not at the domain name.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.400
So the operators of the website needed only

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.670
to move the web server to another IP address

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.040
to defend against the denial of service attack.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.270
A better worm design would have been much more

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.320
catastrophic. Code Red 2 exploited the same vulnerability

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.420
but had a completely different payload, it was released

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.980
on August 4th, 2001, and was called Code

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.990
Red2 mainly because of a comment in the code.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.870
The worm actually only spread on Windows

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.990
2000, it actually crashed on Windows NT.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.810
The scan actually preferred nearby addresses It

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.520
would choose addresses from the same /8

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.085
with probability one half from the same

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:26.910
/16 with probability three eighths, and randomly

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.630
from the entire internet with the remaining

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.460
one eighth probability. The reason for preferring nearby

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.620
IP addresses is that if there was one vulnerable host on the network. There was

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.260
likely to be more, because the same

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.580
administrator that failed to patch the compromised machine

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.480
might have other machines on the same

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.050
network that were also vulnerable. This notion of

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.830
preferential scanning can speed up infections in some

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.880
cases by increasing the probability that scanning will

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.910
find another vulnerable host. The payload of this worm was an IIS

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.300
backdoor, and the worm was completely dead, by design, by October 1,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.250
2001. Nimda released on September 18, 2001

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.450
and was interesting mostly because it spread using

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.390
multiple propagation vectors. It was effectively multi-model. So in addition

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.310
to using the same IIS vulnerability as Code Red 1 and Code Red 2, there were

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.410
some additional vectors that it used. It could

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.460
spread by bulk email as an attachment. It copied

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.460
itself across open network shares. It installed an

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.620
exploit code on webpages on the corresponding web

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.000
server running on the machine, so that any

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.270
browser that visited the webpage for that server would

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.670
become infected itself and it would scan for the Code Red 2 backdoors that

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.350
that worm had installed. The interesting thing

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.980
about the multi-modal nature of the Nimda worm

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.570
is that signature based defences don't necessarily

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.150
help, because of the many ways that it

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.830
could spread, for example, by email or

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.580
via a website exploit, Nimda actually needs firewalls.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.560
Most of the firewalls pass the email carrying

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.050
Nimda completely untouched, using brand new infection with

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.300
an unknown signature, and those scanners couldn't detect

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.250
it. This was the first instance of a worm

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.450
that exploited what we would call a zero

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.720
day attack which is when a worm first appears

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.360
in the wild. And the signature of the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.800
worm is not extracted until minutes, or hours later.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.720
Zero day attacks are particularly viralent because the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.650
worm can spread extremely quickly, before any type

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.670
of signature-based antivirus has a chance to catch

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.870
up and prevent the infections in the first place.
