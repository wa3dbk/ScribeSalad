00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome back. We have the problem that we can't pass floating point parameters up here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And these were done later, result in errors while printing, so what we want to do is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we want to convert them automatically into integers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
How do we do that--well, we simply go along and use the Python function int,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which automatically creates an integer out of the object that's being passed in here,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and in order to make everything real perfect, we also do so in the assertions.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And this is the answer to the quiz.
