00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.892
This first graph over here, this green one, is the graph of y equals x to the

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:10.424
5th. And this purple one is y equals x to the 6th. Notice that this does, in

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:14.064
fact, continue that pattern that we had started to pick up on over here. Just

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:19.390
like x squared and x to the 4th, x to the 6this shaped sort of like a U.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.472
Although it's even steeper or skinnier, than the x to the 4th function. And it's

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:29.785
base looks to be a bit wider. So, as you move away from 0, the graph isn't

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:33.937
initially increasing very quickly. And then it shoots up really fast as soon as

00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:38.698
we move past 1. Think about why this is y. You might want to make a T chart with

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:43.801
values at the input for the function smaller than 1, and see how the value of y

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:48.627
increases as x increases. Now, just like y equals x to the 3rd, y equals x to

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:53.502
the 5th has one tail, or one end of the graph pointing to negative infinity, and

00:00:53.502 --> 00:00:58.463
the other pointing to positive infinity. Then we can see that y equals x to the

00:00:58.463 --> 00:01:03.000
5th is, once again, a skinnier graph than y equals x to the 3rd. But it still

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.863
has pretty much the same shape. This is really interesting.
