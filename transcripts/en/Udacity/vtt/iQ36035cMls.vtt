00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.360
In the last twenty years, one approach to treating Autism has been far superior

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.114
to other forms and has much empirical support. This approach follows ABA

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:15.800
principals, and this specific technique was pioneered by Ivar Lovaas. And is

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.084
termed Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, or EIBI. It's termed Early,

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:26.180
because the children with autism begin treatment very early in their lives,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.755
some as young as 18 months. It's termed Intensive, because it requires 20 to 40

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:37.556
hours of therapy per week. EIBI has been shown to improve adaptive behavior,

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:44.110
expressive language, receptive language and daily communication skills.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.590
Moreover, it improves daily living skills, and some studies have shown

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.757
increases in IQ. Therapist use the principles of ABA to teach children with

00:00:53.757 --> 00:01:00.862
Autism Spectrum Disorders verbal behavior and communication skills. They also

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:05.692
teach these children how to play, as this is a skill that they often lack. This

00:01:05.692 --> 00:01:10.044
evidence based therapy using ABA was recently the subject of the California

00:01:10.044 --> 00:01:15.070
senate. When they unanimously passed an extension to an autism law that

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.563
requires insurance companies to cover ABA therapies for treating ASD. And they

00:01:21.563 --> 00:01:24.440
did so, because these therapies are effective.
