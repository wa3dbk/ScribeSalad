00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.830
This is Marla, a 59 year-old woman
who has become obese as she aged.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.980
She has also smoked cigarettes for
many years.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.050
As a result, she's developed
several chronic diseases.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.910
Through Marla and her story we'll
learn about chronic disease and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.260
the problem it creates for
the US healthcare system.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.470
We'll also gain the background to
appreciate the key role health

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.580
informatics can play in
helping solve those problems.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.670
First, Marla is not unusual.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.730
The Federal government's Medicare
program provides healthcare for

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.630
some 40 million people
over the age of 65, and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.150
pays for
nearly half of all US hospital care.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.084
It is projected to be a major
contributor to future increases in

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:49.577
healthcare spending.

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:55.861
83% of Medicare beneficiaries have
at least one chronic disease, but

00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:02.769
the 23% that have five or more, account
for two thirds of Medicare's costs.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.990
Here is a list of relatively
common chronic diseases, so

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.230
now you know what some of them are.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.490
I could have added cancer,
since many people were surviving it and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.520
being treated for years, but
we'll use this list for now.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.620
If you, anyone in your family,
or anyone you know closely,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.090
have had hypertension, diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.130
heart disease or
chronic kidney disease, check that now
