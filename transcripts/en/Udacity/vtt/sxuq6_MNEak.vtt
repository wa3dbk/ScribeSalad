00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.410
Now that we have this
recursive formulation,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.440
we're ready to develop the algorithm.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.220
Let's convince ourselves first
that the recursive formulation

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.630
would indeed involve some
needless recomputation.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.360
Take the two top level partitions,
A B C times D E

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.640
on the one hand and
A B C D times E on the other.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.870
Clearly, we will have to compute
the minimum cost of multiplying A B C

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.500
in the left problem.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.820
But we are also going to have to
compute it on the right as well

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.590
since we need to pull D off
from this chain at some point.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.560
And we end up doing all the work
involved in figuring out

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.020
how best to multiply A B C over again.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.800
Fortunately for us,
there are only n choose 2 sub-problems.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.010
So we can create a table, and
do the sub-problems in the right order.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.090
The entries along the diagonal
are the base cases, which have cost 0.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.660
The product of 1 matrix
doesn't cost anything, and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.510
our goal is to compute this value
in the corner here, C 1 through n.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.519
The cost of multiplying
matrices a1 through an.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.700
Consider which subproblems
this depends on.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.240
When K equals one, we're considering
these costs here, C11 and C2N.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.500
When K equals two, we're considering
these problems here, C12 and C3N.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.240
When K equals three,
we consider these and so forth.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.670
In general, every entry depends on
all the elements to the left and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.160
downwards of it.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.810
There are many ways to linearize this
diagonal of dependence, but the most

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.010
elegant is to fill out the diagonals
moving towards the corner like this.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.240
We'll let s indicate which
diagonal we're working on.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.720
And then we will fill in
the diagonal entry by entry

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.600
from row 1 as far as it goes.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.830
For this row and diagonal,
the column j will be equal to i + s.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.230
And we compute the entry in the table

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.380
as the minimum of all the possible
splits of the subtree.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.930
The last step, of course,
is just to return this final cost.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.780
The binary tree that produced this
cost can be reconstructed from

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
the k that were chosen that
yielded these minimum values.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.330
We just need to remember the split that
we used for each entry in the table.
