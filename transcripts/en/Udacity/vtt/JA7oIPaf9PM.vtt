00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.590
Now you know how to get data out of

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.410
a variety of sources. In this lesson we're going to

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.120
focus on the data itself. How good is it?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.150
Can it be trusted? Is it reliable? We're going to

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.290
look at a blueprint for auditing our data to

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.370
assess it's quality, and we'll look at a number of

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.440
different quality measures. We'll also look at ways of

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.770
cleaning our data to correct any problems that we find

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.880
with it. As we'll see, this is a process

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.880
that's very situation specific. But even so, we can

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.950
identify a number of rules of thumb and best

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.410
practices that apply in a variety of different contexts.
