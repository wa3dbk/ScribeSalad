00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.250
If you're used to working with mobile
devices then your primary input

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.200
device is a touch screen that's
always going to be connected

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.830
unless your device is
having a very bad day.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.910
By contrast, TV remote controls and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.800
game controllers are usually
connected via Bluetooth.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.050
Because they're battery powered
controllers often sleep to save power,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.770
shutting down their radios after
a couple minutes of unuse.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.700
In this lesson,
we'll learn how to handle connect and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.120
disconnect events from input devices.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.180
The InputManager fires events when
devices are connected or disconnected,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.540
and it provides a method for
us to register an InputDeviceListener,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.030
which we can use to
subscribe to these events.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.070
Here they are, you can probably
guess what two of these mean.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.180
OnInputDeviceAdded and

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.625
onInputDeviceRemoved are triggered when
devices are connected or disconnected.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.100
OnInputDeviceChanged is
a little bit different.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.080
Typically, input devices don't
change but they certainly can.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.690
For example,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.730
you can imagine a game controller
might have two different modes.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.450
A good strategy for dealing with a
change event is to simply disconnect and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.530
then reconnect the device.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.480
Let's see how our asteroids
game handles this, and

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.470
we'll start back in the GameView.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.510
The fist thing to notice is that our
view implements the InputDeviceListener

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.590
interface, and we'll see where
this is defined in a sec.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.120
Once we've implemented that interface,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.870
all we need to do is override
those three methods we discussed.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.840
Here's onInputDeviceAdded.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.590
What's cool here is that when
a controller is connected our game

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.870
gets the device ID and
then creates a ship for it.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.400
We maintain a mapping from
ship to input device and

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.270
in this way we can support
multiple players easily.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.970
When a controller is disconnected
we simply remove the ship

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.770
corresponding to that device ID.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.400
Pretty easy, right?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.840
Here we are in the constructor
of our game view.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.070
The last step is to get a reference
to the InputManager and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.270
then register our view as Listener for
it.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.790
Rather than directly
accessing the system classes,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.610
we use the InputManagerCompat
provided by the controller sample.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.400
This is code that you're free to reuse.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.789
It abstracts the way differences and

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.130
how input devices are handled across
different versions of Android.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.110
Instead of designing your game to work
within InputManager from a specific

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.510
Android version, you can design your
game logic against InputManagerCompat.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.390
This class contains a factory
method which behind the scenes

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.100
will instantiate an appropriate
concrete implementation

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.660
depending on which version of Android
your game happens to be running on.

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:12.800
And you can see that Factory
method inside InputManagerCompat

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.640
right down here at the bottom.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.550
And by the way, the Factory designed
pattern is one of my favorites, and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.480
I highly recommend learning it
if you haven't seen it before.
