00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.020
So I want to use this opportunity to,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.702
completely, define, an image gradient in a discrete form.

00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:10.540
For a two dimensional function, F of x and y,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.078
the partial derivative would basically be del of F x,

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:19.380
y with respect to x, and this is of course in just x direction.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.595
And of course what we would basically be looking for is a small epsilon x

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:28.740
over x, between the two different values with epsilon gong to infinity.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.930
For the discrete data, we can approximate this using finite differences.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.030
Which basically says for x, the del F x, y could be approximated with just

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.890
moving 1 in, index point, in x, so of course, this would be as we have always

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.050
looked at images to be discrete samples of moving from one row to the others.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.760
In this case, of course, one column to the other keeping y the same, and

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.930
of course approximating with the difference like this.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.150
This is in essence what we just did in the previous cases of 1-D example,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.790
when we just took one row and subtracted from the other one, of course we would

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.180
do the same, for this one, for rows, for y, and of course, columns for x.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.325
And this is basically an approximation that allows us to do simple image

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:14.960
differences and use derivatives for images.
