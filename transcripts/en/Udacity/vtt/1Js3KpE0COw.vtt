00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.826
Before I write the code for this, I want to work it out for a couple other

00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:07.624
examples. Probably the easiest example would be January 2nd, 1900 since I know

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:12.991
that would be a Tuesday. I can calculate the days that January 2nd is after

00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:19.654
January 1st, by using the daysFrom method on the day object. In this case, it

00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:23.890
would give 1. Now, the day of the week would be the reference day plus the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.043
number of days that we are away from it. So, in our case, Monday, plus the

00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:34.027
number of days after. And this will work for this case. But if I take a

00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:39.679
slightly farther away case, like January 8th, 1900. I know that would be a

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:44.828
Monday again. But it's seven days after. So, I would get that it was 1 plus 7,

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:51.990
which is weekday 8. Weekday 8 doesn't exist. We only have up to weekday six.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.213
So, what I really mean to do is start on Monday, and add seven days. One, two,

00:00:57.213 --> 00:01:04.837
three, four, five. Six, seven. So, instead of continuing up to, day 7 and day

00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:11.915
8, I go back to day zero and up to day one. So, that means that I'm using mod.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:18.916
In this case mod 7. So, the uncorrected value in that case would of been 8, and

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:23.092
to correct it, I would calculate that the actual day of the week was the

00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:29.144
original one, the uncorrected one, mod 7. The first thing I need to do is

00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:31.645
create a day for the reference day and I'm actually not going to use birthday

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:35.540
in this case. So, this is actually the wrong way to do this, because I might

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.992
want to use this program to calculate lots of different days. While I'm

00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:43.650
testing, I'll make this an easy day, like I just mentioned so, January 8th,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.350
1900 and I'll set up my reference day. So, now I'm going to calculate the days

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.466
between the referenceDay and the desiredDay. Using that good old daysFrom

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:58.270
method and now the uncorrectedWeekDay would be the weekday of the referenceDay.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.522
I'll call is referenceWeekDay. Which is a Monday, plus the number of days

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:09.389
between the referenceDay and the day we're interested in. And now to get the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:15.214
correctedWeekDay, we take mod 7 from the uncorrectedWeekDay. let's check if I

00:02:15.214 --> 00:02:18.628
made any mistakes. I'm pretty sure that my answers should be Monday, that was

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:25.534
what I calculated before. Forgot to say that this is a day. And that one too

00:02:25.534 --> 00:02:30.748
and the referenceWeekDay was an int and I can't find a variable weekday.

00:02:30.748 --> 00:02:35.440
Because what I called correctedWeekDay should actually just be weekday and that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.841
one should work better. So, now if I run the method, I get that weekday is

00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:44.357
minus 6. Must be a bug. So, where could I have gone wrong? Somehow I got a

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:47.994
negative number here. I must have got a negative number because

00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:53.923
referenceWeekDay plus daysBetween is a negative number. ReferenceWeekDay is

00:02:53.923 --> 00:02:57.587
definitely 1. So, daysBetween must have been negative. It looks like

00:02:57.587 --> 00:03:02.076
referenceDay.daysFrom desiredDay is a negative number, but I'm here assuming

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:06.414
that I'm using it to count up. I'm going to check that using the debugger. I'll

00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:11.882
put a break point in and I'll run the method. So, when I step over the line

00:03:11.882 --> 00:03:16.107
where I initialized daysBetween, I can now see that daysBetween is coming out

00:03:16.107 --> 00:03:21.124
as negative seven. So, my suspicion is confirmed. Instead of calling

00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:25.476
referenceDay.daysFrom desiredDay, I should have called desiredDay.daysFrom

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:29.484
referenceDay. Let's try this one out. Now I actually get the weekday I

00:03:29.484 --> 00:03:33.214
expected. And I'm ready to go back and reset this day to the day I was

00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:38.160
interested in, which was June 18th, 1983. Looks like Sally Ride entered low

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.600
Earth orbit on a Saturday.
