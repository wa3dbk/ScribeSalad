Requirement 6 recall, says, "Books are checked out for three weeks unless they

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.490
are currently bestsellers, in which case the limit is two weeks." Okay, what's

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.980
happening a key that points to an issue here is that they're explicit numbers.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.880
And if they're explicit numbers then typically that means there has to be some

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.950
kind of a check. And if there's a check, where you going to express the check

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.570
okay. It turns out that UML provides a way to express requirements like this and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.960
associate them with elements of the diagram, and this part of UML is called

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.050
the Object Constraint Language, or OCL. It's an official part of the language.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.090
It's available and supported by tools, including drawing tools

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.300
that you can then annotate various parts of the diagram with, with the OCL.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.720
It provides, that is OCL provides sufficient expressive power

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.890
to convey to any level of detail the functional requirements of a system because

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.080
it's essentially equivalent. In power to the first order of logic,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.570
okay? So, let's see how we would express Requirement six using OCL
