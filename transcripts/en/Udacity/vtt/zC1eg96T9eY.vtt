Direct interaction, where for example, you use the mouse to control or

00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:08.048
influence what's happening in the scene, is handled using events. An event is

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:12.170
generated by the system whenever a user presses a key or uses the mouse. There

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.898
are other kinds of events, but these two, keyboard and mouse input, are the

00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:18.991
main ones we care about in Three.js. Well, I should mention there's also a

00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.738
touch interface that's somewhat similar to the mouse interface, so that you can

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:25.774
interact with scenes on a smart phone, or other touch-sensitive display. You

00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:29.702
can ignore any and all events or can listen for any you wish. Here's code for

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:32.650
listening to a mouse click event, specifically mouse down, which means when the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.839
mouse is first clicked. If you want to wait until the mouse button was

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.222
released, you would listen for mouse up. The addListener event takes a function

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:43.450
name as an input. Whenever the mouse button is clicked this function is called.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.180
This code defines the function called on mouse down. This preventDefault line

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.660
is optional. It makes your program not past the mouse event on up to the page

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.068
running your javascript program. I usually don't use this call. The rest of

00:00:55.068 --> 00:00:58.093
this function is up to you. A mouse or key click could modify an object, start

00:00:58.093 --> 00:01:02.456
an animation, you name it. Enough talk. What follows is an example of using the

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:06.840
mouse down event to perform picking. You are orbiting around a bunch of blocks.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.159
Try clicking on a block as you move past them.
