00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.170
Now we're going to set
up a simple project, so

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.560
we can experiment with presenting
stock view controllers.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.550
You're probably familiar with views like
the Camera Roll, Activity Views, and

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.770
Alert Views.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.050
These are off the shelf view controllers
which we'll present without modifying

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.290
Apple's code.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.580
To get some practice with presenting
off the shelf view controllers,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.580
we'll make a one button app
with a method named experiment,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.200
which presents one of
Apple's view controllers.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.580
It'll look something like this.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.890
One button which presents
the camera roll, and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.820
the experiment method will
look something like this.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.460
In this method we'll need a reference
to the view controller we're

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.490
about to present.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.900
So how will we get that
view controller reference?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.090
We'll just make one.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.210
So here we invoke the constructor for
the view controller required to select

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.890
an image, and then in this line,
we present the image picker.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.670
Now see if you can repeat
this experiment on your own.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.450
Just create a single view project
with a button labeled Present, and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.710
then connect that button to
an action named experiment.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.840
If you get stuck, consult
the steps in the instructor notes.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.520
But first try to complete
it without peeking.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.849
Again, your app should
look something like this.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.330
When you're finished,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.260
describe your level of confidence
working through this exercise.
