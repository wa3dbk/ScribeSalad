00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.660
I've talked about eyes and cameras and how they

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.220
both work. The eye is part of our visual system.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.100
The brain interprets what the eye sees. How is

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.850
this visual system different than how a camera produces an

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.780
image on its film or sensors? In other words,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.550
how does our brain interpret what the eye itself records?

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.345
Is it that the eye's sharpness changed with lenses?

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:25.690
Bright light can blind us? We can control what our

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.360
eyes focus on? Or we see images correct side up not upside down?
