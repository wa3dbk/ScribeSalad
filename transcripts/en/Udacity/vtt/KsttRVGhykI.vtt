00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.899
So now we've arrived at these two equations. This is what we learned about Euler's number,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.099
and this is what you saw in the previous quiz about the exponential function.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.799
Where X was equal to pi. These equations are very elegant, but highly inefficient.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.232
Who wants to compute the product of millions or billions of factors?

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:27.432
Power series come to our rescue. If you actually want to compute Euler's number or the exponential function,

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:33.432
you're going to use power series. So let's try and turn this product into a sum of powers of X.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:41.566
To get started, here's a quiz for you: One plus X over four to the fourth power. What would that be?

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:49.966
Some number without X plus some number times X, plus some number times X squared,

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:58.399
plus some number times X to the third power, plus some number times X to the fourth power.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.367
Fill in these numbers using integers such as three or fractions such as five over 42.
