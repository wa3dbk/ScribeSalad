00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.750
There are three cardinal
properties of frames.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.510
The first property is that
frames represents stereotypes.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.327
Now we all know about stereotypes.

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:11.231
We deal with stereotypes all the time.

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:14.675
Here's a stereotype for
the world eat or ate.

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:19.515
And this particular stereotype,
the slots are dealing with our

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:24.210
stereotypical, my stereotypical notion
of what happens when something is eaten.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.365
There is a subject and it is a frog.

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:27.805
There is a location.
There is a time.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:30.614
You may have a different
set of stereotypes.

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:34.465
In fact, stereotypes often
are very culture specific.

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:37.320
Second, frames provide default values.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.310
So not only do they have these
slots which come from other notions

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.000
of a stereotype of this particular word,
but

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
many of these slots may have
values already filled in.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.367
As an example, I may already
have a default value which says

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:55.161
that after the object has been eaten,
it is no longer alive.

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:59.590
It is inside the subject's stomach,
and the subject's mood is now happy.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.830
There are our default values.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.480
Of course, when you have default,
you can also have exceptions to them.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.926
As an example,
it may be that when Ashok ate a frog,

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.707
it made him sad because frogs
don't suit him very well.

00:01:12.707 --> 00:01:17.140
Now the exception handling is
both very powerful and a problem.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.110
It is powerful because I can have
stereotypes or default values, and

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.110
when needed,
I can override the default values.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.261
But it's also a problem,
because you can see what will happen.

00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:28.828
The more instances that I have,

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:31.859
the more times where I'll be
overriding some default value.

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:32.517
And then I have to

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:36.030
go to worry about how to manage
all of this exceptional handling.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.230
Nevertheless, frames provide a very nice
way of capturing both default values and

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.760
exception handling.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.130
The third cardinal property of frames
is that they exhibit inheritance.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.360
So I can organize this
frames in a frame hierarchy.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.350
Here is a frame for an animal, and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.050
then, that has two subclasses, a frame
for an ant and a frame for a human.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.380
Note, I'm using the language of
classes and subclasses here.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.633
Now inheritance works, in that I may
have some slot for the class animal,

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:10.411
and then, I may specify for the ant more
specific values for some of those slots.

00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:14.358
For example, number of legs is six or
the number of arms is zero.

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:17.554
But, the important thing is that
I inherited these slots from

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:18.608
the super-class.

00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:21.290
Of course,
when I specify the sub-classes,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.070
when I go down this frame hierarchy,
I may keep on adding additional slots.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.282
So for a human man,
we may also add the job and the name.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.179
There's classes then we have instances,

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:37.176
as an example, Ashock is the name of
the person and the job is a professor.

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:41.541
And so, this instance is also
inheriting all these slots and

00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:44.360
the slot values from the class.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.522
&gt;&gt; We can also see that when the frames
provide default values, that's very

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:50.939
similar to a constructor when we're
dealing with object oriented programming

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.115
that supplies some initial values
when an object is first instantiated.

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:57.170
So it seems like there's actually a very
rich connection between classes and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.690
frames here.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.102
&gt;&gt; David, that's a very good point.

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:02.423
In fact, there is a history to it.

00:03:02.423 --> 00:03:07.032
Frames and object-oriented
programming came about the same time,

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:09.343
the 1960s and the 1970s.

00:03:09.343 --> 00:03:12.540
And I'm sure they influenced
each other in both directions.
