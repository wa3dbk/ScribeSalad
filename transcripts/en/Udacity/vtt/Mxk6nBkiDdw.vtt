00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.750
As we discussed in the class the right thing to

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.050
do here was to use the factory pattern. So here is

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.910
a possible code to solve the problem. Of course that there

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.220
are different possible solutions. So what we did for this code

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.210
was to first create a private, static, Singleton object called

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.340
instance, which is the one that will keep track of the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.250
only instance that can be created on the class. Then we

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.750
define the default constructor, the constructor that doesn't take any parameter

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.900
as private. In this way other classes cannot create instances

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.310
of Singleton without calling our factory method, and finally we

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.650
create the factory method. And the factory method is very

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.600
simple. The method will first check whether an instance of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.970
the class was already created. If it was created, it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.010
would just return that instance. Otherwise, it will create a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.550
new instance and assign it to that instance member variable

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.960
and then return the newly created instance. So with this code

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.540
you're guaranteed that other classes cannot bypass the factory

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.530
method, because the default constructor is private. And the that

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.600
the factory method will create one and only one instance

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.020
of the class, which is exactly what our requirements were.
