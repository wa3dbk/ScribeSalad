00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.953
Let’s analyze them one by one. This requires at

00:00:02.953 --> 00:00:07.340
least 1C and then you can have zero or more As.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.412
This is CA star and we’re suppose to match

00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:13.701
optional CA star, so this isn’t quite right. A string

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.690
that’s accepted up here A or even the empty string

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.797
is not accepted down here. Down here this finite

00:00:19.797 --> 00:00:21.333
state machine would allow you to do

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.747
A, C, A, C, A, C, to alternate between them

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:26.353
because there is only one state. The regular

00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:29.207
expression up top does not. Over here this is

00:00:29.207 --> 00:00:31.771
looking relatively promising; if we have no C's we

00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:34.763
can have a star that’s pretty good and we can also

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:37.294
have an optional C. But here is a string accepted

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:40.869
by this first regular expression C, AA that is not

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:43.358
accepted by this machine. C and then we would

00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:45.694
fall off. So this is not a good bat, so either I’m

00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:48.634
super evil or this last one is the winner and it turns

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.697
out that the last one is the winner. And essentially

00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:55.284
up here we have A star and down here we have

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:58.539
CA star. When I put these two paths together, I

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.431
get optional C followed by A star.
