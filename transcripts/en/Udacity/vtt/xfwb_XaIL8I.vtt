00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
With this algorithm in hand, we can actually do some useful analysis

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
beyond just discovering things about the size of the components.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So what I'm going to ask you to do is to take the code that I wrote

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and see if you can call it in a way that will answer this question.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We're given a graph G that includes a node v1 and a node v2.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We want to call mark_component

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and use that to discover whether or not there is some path--even if we don't know what it is--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but some path that takes us from v1 through the graph to v2.
