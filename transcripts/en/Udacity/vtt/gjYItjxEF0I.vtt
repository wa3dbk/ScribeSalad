00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.830
How do we understand the risk that is
posed to the cyber assets that we have?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.230
So this is going to require that we
understand the risk to the online

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.220
information, and the systems where it is
stored, and how they're connected, and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.470
who they can be accessed by,
and things like that.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.400
So these kind of questions
are exactly what we call

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.830
developing a security mindset.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.450
A security mindset is really

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.340
asking the kind of questions
that I was just talking about.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.120
So if you say, well what exactly,
how do you define a security mindset?

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.290
You have to say, well,
who are the bad actors?

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.430
What can possibly they exploit?

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.460
What vulnerabilities do I have?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.580
And if they are successful in
exploiting a vulnerability,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.880
what is that attack going to be?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.800
So in the security mindset,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.910
the first thing we worry about
is what is the threat source.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.940
In particular, who is the entity
that wants to do us harm?

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.270
So, there are obviously these
criminals who are in it for

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.440
the money, professional criminals
who want to profit from

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.260
the data that they can steal.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.266
There's another sort of threat
source people worry about.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:15.028
These are activists who use
the Internet, in particular, hacking.

00:01:15.028 --> 00:01:19.470
That's why they're called hacktivists,
and they have some sort of an agenda.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.630
People may agree with it,
or may not agree with it.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.820
When you sort of think about Snowden,
well he had an agenda.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.000
He didn't like certain things that
the US government was doing, and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.570
that was the reason for him.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.670
It wasn't that he was trying to profit
from the information that he took, but

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.160
the reason really was activism.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.290
Finally, threats can
come from nation-states.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.500
And countries are actually doing this,
they're doing it for

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.300
political advantage, they're doing
it for spying on each other.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.600
So the risk comes from sort of
the threat source, sort of the entire

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.390
spectrum, from a set of group of
criminals all the way to nation-states.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.364
So the threats are clearly very real.
