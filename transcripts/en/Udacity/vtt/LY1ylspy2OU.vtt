00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.200
Here is one way to explain the Mapreduce programming

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.850
model. Say that I wanted to count the number of

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.930
occurrences of each word that appears at least once in

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.460
a document. Let's use the text of Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.750
Here's a bit of text that says Alice was

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.400
begining to get very tired of sitting by her sister

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.560
on the bank And of having nothing to do. If

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.600
I wanted to solve this problem without Mapreduce, I might

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.680
create a Python dictionary consisting of all the words

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.600
and their counts. I could go through the document

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.570
and say, for each word in the document, if

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.980
there is a key for that word, add one.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.375
Otherwise, set the initial for that key equal to

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.590
one. And instead of applying it to this short

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.070
sentence fragment from the book, we'd apply it to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.640
the entire book. Before we solve this problem with Mapreduce,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.480
why don't you try to write a Python script

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.720
along the lines of what we just discussed, that will

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.060
get the job done. Given many lines of a text,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.530
create a dictionary with a key for each word, and

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.390
a value corresponding to the count of the word in

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.880
that text. Note that we want the words to be

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.360
stripped of any capitalization and punctuation. We just want the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.920
basic words. Here's some code to get you started. First,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.990
we import system string. And then we

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.360
initialize an empty dictionary, which will hold our

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.840
words and values. We cycle through the lines of the input, and for each line we

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.730
create an array, data. Which is essentially all

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.700
of the words in that line, split by

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.780
white space. So if we started with this

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.060
line. Hello, how are you? It would become,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.910
hello, how, are, and you, in an array of length four. Your code should go here.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.120
After we split the line by white space, and before we print out the dictionary.
