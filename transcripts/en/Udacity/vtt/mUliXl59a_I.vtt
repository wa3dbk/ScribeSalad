00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.320
To get started with
SleepingInTheLibrary,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.190
you'll want to download
the starter project for the app.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.450
The download link is posted
in the instructor notes.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.259
The UI is already built for this app, so

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.276
we can focus on just
the networking aspects.

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:21.522
If we run the app,
we have a title label at the top, and

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:24.580
then we have a button at the bottom
that'll grab a new image from Flickr.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.530
Right now, if we tap the button,
it just disables the UI and it waits for

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.000
an image to be loaded from Flickr.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.941
Back in our Story Board, we can
see that there's an image view for

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.103
our image, as well as a label,
this photo title label that we

00:00:39.103 --> 00:00:41.975
can use to display any text
associated with the image.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.151
Then in the viewController.swift file,
we have a single action,

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:55.450
grabNewImage, that's called
when the button is pressed.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.440
In the action, we disabled the UI so
that we can't ask for

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.660
a new image while waiting for
another image to load.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.939
And then we call
the getImageFromFlickr method.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.644
This is where we'll start
writing our networking code.

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:18.240
First, we'll create the NSURL.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.830
We can do this directly just by copying
the URL like we saw in the API Explorer.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.250
But from a design standpoint something
doesn't really feel right about this.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.010
It's not very maintainable.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.340
What if the names for the arguments
change, or we want to change the URL and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.520
use different arguments?

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.099
It'd be much better if we
broke this URL to pieces.

00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:49.400
The good news is, is we're going to
help you out a little bit.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.370
If you've been poking around,
you may have noticed that we've created

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.210
a separate Swift file,
Constants.swift, where we've defined

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.960
all the constants for doing just that,
breaking the URL into pieces.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.450
Here in this file there are structs
that contain constants for

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.010
the different parameter keys and
values that we want to use in our URL.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.710
So what's with the static keyword and

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.370
also what are the structs that are
contained within the constant struct?

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.590
First, the static keyword,
it's similar to the class keyword.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.350
And what it's doing here is it's saying,
this Method property,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.940
it doesn't belong to FlickrParameterKeys
struct instances, but

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.490
instead it belongs to
the whole struct itself.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.040
Now, that may sound a little confusing,
but the benefit of this approach is that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.920
we can refer to these constant values
using a really nice dot notation,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.370
and it's very intuitive.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.204
So let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:53.687
And this is also going to help explain
the structs within structs that we

00:02:53.687 --> 00:02:54.990
saw in the constants file.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.395
So if we want to specify the method,
let me make sure which one that is, so

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:06.980
FlickrPrameterKeys, and
then the method value, we can do this.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.640
And just like that, we're referring to a
constant in this very nice dot notation

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.223
that kind of goes left to right and
it reads in a very intuitive way.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.965
Similarly, we could specify the API
key by going Constants.Flickr.

00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:32.134
Nope it's in Flickr, I think values,
ParameterValues, here we go.

00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:33.612
API key.

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:35.549
Like so.

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.439
And because of each of these properties,
the method and

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.150
the API key are declared as static,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.300
we never have to make instants of
the constant struct to use them.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.510
Now you don't have to do it this way but

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.571
we've chosen it because it's a nice way
to maintain all the constant values

00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.122
in one place,
where we can easily change them.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.130
Now, back in the view controller, we can
use these constants to build the URL.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.220
And I'll add a print statement for
good measure.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.430
So let's build and run, and
test if our URL is what we want.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.320
And this is not bad.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.040
You'll notice that in
the API key argument

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.200
here I have the YOUR API KEY value.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.117
You want to substitute
your API key in there.

00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:29.916
But I think we can do
a lot better than this.

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:33.950
This might be harder to see
than the first one was.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.290
I propose that we optimize the building
of our URL by creating a method that

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.790
formats all of the arguments.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.310
And this will be more
reusable obviously, and

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.460
it'll also give us an opportunity
to escape any of the characters

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.310
in the arguments that might
include unsafe ASCII characters.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.910
Let's do this next.
