00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So now we come to the last problem of unit 6 and actually the last problem for entire course

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
aside from the final exam at least.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now you have a chance to put together all of the informations that we gave you in unit 6

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to create a 2-D wild fire.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're going to be looking at a big grid of forest and seeing how diffusion, heat loss, wind,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and combustion come together to affect the time derivative of the temperature.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
As I talked about before, these four factors can simply be added together

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to show how T changes with time.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's look at the code for a second to figure out what are we going to ask you to do.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
As you can see, they've given you a number of different constants

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that are going to help you out a lot.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
One thing that's kind of a small detail that maybe interesting to know

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is that the velocity due to the wind, which we can see right here, is actually very low.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's much lower than the velocity of the wind itself since the fire is only going to follow the wind

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
at a fraction of the wind's real speed.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
As I said earlier, your first task is going to be to take into account heat diffusion,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
heat loss, wind, and combustion in the 2-D heat equation right here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Fortunately, we're not going to ask you to use the implicit method that you used in homework 1.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can just use the explicit method you used before so basically the forward Euler method.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And important thing that we need to deal within this problem is especially the varying conditions.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We must be careful to not introduce any hard edges anywhere, or they will probably lead to artifact.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
First in the solver to the huge values in the derivative and second in terms of the model itself.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We want to make sure that we don't see any staircases or pixelated contours

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or really anything that does not look like reality.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
To help deal with this, we have already included a smooth calcium bell shaped

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
for the initial distribution of the temperature.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The second thing that you need to do, however, is to create an initial distribution for the wood density.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, I'll give you a little bit more information about that right now.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Remember the grid that we're creating using the code

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
is basically making a map of the terrain that we're looking at.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This graph right here is going to give you an idea

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
of what we are looking for in terms of wood density distribution.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now here we have a bunch of lines that are parallel to one another but slightly displaced.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
X and y are actually just the physical coordinates that we are looking at.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But the different colors of the different lines correspond

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to changes in the wood density at each location.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So every point along the blue line is going to have the same density as every other point on that line.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Every point on this purple line has the same density and so on and so forth.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
In the code, we created 2 constants for you, wood 1 and wood 2 which have underscores in the code.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That would be very clear what they are referring to.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In this mark out, the highest and the lowest possible values of wood density that we have in our forest.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now, all of these lines are parallel to one another, and we've given you the slope and the code.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That means that the only factor differentiating from one another is their y intercepts.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
If you make a graph of wood density versus y intercept to make something looks like this.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You can see that we are only letting wood density vary between wood 1 and wood 2, right here.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Another hint that might be helpful when you're doing this problem

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is that you can solve for the y intercept of given line by saying that

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the y intercept equals some y value minus the slope times the x value of that point.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So it's kind of a tricky problem but remember it's your very last one before the final.

00:03:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If you have any trouble, come to forums. Good luck.
