00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.220
Today we are canceling
the robot apocalypse!

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.020
First we need to activate
GigaGal's arm cannon and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.810
make sure we clean up
the bullets that fly off screen.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.200
Then we need to add in explosions
when ever GigaGal scores a hit or

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.910
destroys an enemy.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.330
Finally, ammo isn't free, so
we need to add in ammo power ups for

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.140
GigaGal to grab.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.340
Let's get started.
