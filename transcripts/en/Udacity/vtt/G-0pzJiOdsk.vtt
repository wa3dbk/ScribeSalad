00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.578
So let's pick one of these graphs to play with a little bit more so we can get

00:00:02.578 --> 00:00:06.520
better acquainted with rational functions. As I'm looking at these equations, I

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.110
think that h of x is equal to 1 over x would be a great one to start out with.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.030
So, let's pick that, I'm going to blow it up here for you. So here's our graph

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.897
blown up. Now there actually are two lines for the graph of y equals 1 over x

00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:23.917
will never cross. Can you tell from the graph here, or from the equation, what

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:28.890
those two lines are? Please type in their equations right there. Now, don't

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.798
worry at all if you don't get them. I'm going to talk a lot more about this, in

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.899
just a bit.
