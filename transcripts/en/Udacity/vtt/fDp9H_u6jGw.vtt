00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.780
Let's start by looking at line f, this turquoise line right here. I like to find

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:10.437
the y-intercept first, which on line f, is at 0, negative 2. So b is just

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:15.422
negative 2. Then I can use this point to help me find the slope. If I move over

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:20.935
1 to the right, I need to move down 1 in order to hit the line again. So, the

00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:26.545
slope is going to be negative 1 over 1 or other words just negative 1. For line

00:00:26.557 --> 00:00:32.485
g, the y-intercept is actually the origin, 0, 0. This means that b has to equal

00:00:32.497 --> 00:00:37.965
0. To find the slope, I see that if I start at the origin, I can move to the

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:43.693
right 2 units and then down 1 unit to reach the graph again. So, the slope is

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:49.327
going to be negative 1, since we moved down 1 in the y direction, over positive

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.743
2, since we stepped 2 to the right. So, the slope is negative 1/2. And lastly,

00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:59.500
we come to line h. This intersects the y-axis at 0, 3, b then is 3.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:05.525
Interestingly enough, just like with g, if we walk over 2, we have to walk down

00:01:05.537 --> 00:01:09.652
1 to get back to the graph. So, the slope for this is also negative 1/2.
