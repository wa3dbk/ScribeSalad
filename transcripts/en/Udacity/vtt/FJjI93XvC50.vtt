00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.678
Since the mean is supposed to be the same as the population mean, then it will

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:11.051
be one of these two. So, which one of these looks to have a standard deviation

00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:17.659
of about 2.71? For this wider one, the standard deviation looks like it's at

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:23.556
least 5. So, this is the correct sampling distribution. So, why is knowing the

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:29.071
shape of the sampling distribution important? Well, first of all, let's say we

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:31.546
want to increase our klout score.
