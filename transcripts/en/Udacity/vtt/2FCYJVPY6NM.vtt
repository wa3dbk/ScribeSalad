00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.630
So let's take a look at the code

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.030
for the set announcement servlet. You'll need to

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.500
have imported the memcache service and the memcache

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.630
service factory. Obviously import all the things you

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.250
need for attp servlet, and you'll have to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.980
import the conference and the constants. The set

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.230
announcement servlet extends http servlet, and then basically

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.660
we write the logic to find out the conferences

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.141
that are nearly sold out. So this is just a query. So we do the ofy.load. We're

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:36.552
loading entities of kind conference. We're filtering first on

00:00:36.552 --> 00:00:39.505
seats available less than five, but there's no point

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:41.881
in telling us about conferences that have no

00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:44.278
seats left at all. So obviously we need to

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:47.279
filter on seat available at least one, ie, which

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:50.669
is greater than, greater than zero. And then we

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:53.054
create an array, and basically just add each of the

00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:56.280
conference names to the array. And then, if we do have

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.320
some conferences, we're going to build a string that we're going to

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.000
use as the announcement. We get the announcement key, which is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.690
stored in the Constants file. Obviously, we have to get

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.690
the Memcache service, so we use the MemcacheServiceFactory to get the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.890
Memcache Service. We use announcement key, and we save our announcement in

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.804
Memcache. We set the status of the response to 204.
