00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:03.459
As app developers, it's our job 
to maintain the illusion

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:07.074
that once started, every app 
is waiting patiently in the background

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:09.703
looking for its chance to be the star
when called on.

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:13.233
So whenever the user switches back
to your app, whether or not the system

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:14.687
is killed during in the interim,

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:18.129
they should be presented 
with the same UI they had when they left.

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:22.027
To help, Android has a pair of handlers
specifically for persisting state

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:23.559
in these circumstances.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.913
OnSaveInstanceState is called 
immediately before onPause.

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.687
So, as soon as your app 
is no longer active,

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:36.959
an onRestoreInstanceState 
is called immediately after onCreate,

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.520
but only if the app is being restarted

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.623
after having been terminated
by the system.

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:45.835
That means you can read the bundle 
of state information saved the last time

00:00:45.835 --> 00:00:48.855
your app was moved 
to the foreground here.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:51.614
The next time, 
you'll use the switches to your app

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:53.811
even if it was killed by the system
in the mean time.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.778
Using that bundle, you can return 
your UI to the same state it was

00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:00.469
the last time the user saw it,
creating a seamless transition

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.230
that hides the resource management
happening under the covers.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.648
That's enough of the "why,"
let's go back to Dan

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:09.385
and see how to put this theory
into practice.
