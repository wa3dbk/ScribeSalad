00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.640
Now let's turn our attention to Auditing Accuracy. As I

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.460
mentioned in the overview, this is something that is difficult to

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.760
do in a lot of situations because it requires gold

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.870
standard data. Let's take a look at our city's info box

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.320
data set for an example. Returning to the Hyderabad wikipedia

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.800
page. If we scroll down, we can see that country is

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.140
one of the fields that's included in the info box

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.120
data for this, and for most countries in this data set.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.690
Now it's possible in our data that the countries specified

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.630
for a city isn't actually a valid country for one

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.406
reason or another. So in order to audit this country

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:39.002
field for accuracy, we're going to need some means of programmatically

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.670
processing it and comparing and the values that we find

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.990
to some set of data that we can reliably assume is

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.740
correct. So, the gold standard data that I'm going to use

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.890
here is some country code data from the ISO. The International

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.340
Standards Organization. This is data that pairs a two digit country

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.600
code with a country name. So in order to verify these country

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.680
codes, we're essentially going to do a look up of each name

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.170
we find in this list of country names we can rely on.
