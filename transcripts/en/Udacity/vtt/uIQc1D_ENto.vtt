To finish typing the rest of this inequality, you should have entered a

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:08.918
backslash, the letters le, a space, the letter b, another backslash, and an le,

00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:13.633
and another space, and then the number 2. This last one is really complicated.

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:17.729
But hopefully, you stayed with it and figured it out. First, we type a

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:22.630
backslash, the letters inf, and a space for this infinity symbol. Then, we use a

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:27.616
backslash and the letters ge and a space for the greater than or equal to sign.

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:32.674
We have the letter x next, and then another backslash ge space for the greater

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:37.250
than or equal to sign. And finally, we finish out with a negative sign or

00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:42.405
negative infinity, and a backslash letters, inf, and a space. This will give us

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:46.507
our last negative infinity. Feel free to play around with MathQuill and see if

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.701
you can type in some other things. We'll definitely be learning more about

00:00:50.713 --> 00:00:51.756
MathQuill as we go.
