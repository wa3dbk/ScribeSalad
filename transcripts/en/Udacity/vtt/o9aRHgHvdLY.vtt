00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; So we actually going to
explore this idea of labels,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.840
that a mandatory access control
policy would use in a DOD,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.890
Department of Defense
kind of environment.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.470
A little bit more by
looking at some examples.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.529
So information is going to
have classification and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.702
users going to have clearances, okay?

00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:22.956
So the highest sensitivity
typically is top secret,

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:26.501
that's the innermost one then secret,
confidential and

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:31.610
going out we have this unclassified we
said this information anyone can see.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.470
So most sensitive,
least sensitive, this is.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.160
We said, the level at which
has somebody is cleared or

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.800
the classification
level of the document.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.160
So we said label is going to
be a sensitivity level.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.410
So for example,
it could be top secret here and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.370
a compartment that describes what kind
of data is contained in the document.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.840
So are we going to, let's say look at
documents one, that is top secret.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.970
And let's say these documents
have information about

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.710
various arm stock piles.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.110
So this document let us talks about
nuclear and chemical weapons.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.380
You hear about them in the news, so
this is clearly extremely sensitive.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.800
So we going to say
that is top secret and

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.720
the document contains information about
both nuclear and chemical weapons.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.370
We have another document that
has information about let's say

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.650
conventional.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.750
So maybe it's sensitive but
it's a notch below.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.460
So let's say this is only secret.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.150
So we have two labels here.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.678
L 1, L 1 sensitivity level it's TS
comma the compartment is nuclear,

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.150
comma chemical.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.860
Remember this compartment
here looks like a set, okay?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.430
So their document may pertain
to multiple topics or areas.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.026
Each one of them could be in this and
that's the description of

00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:51.270
the document using the set
of terms that we have here.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.560
So L1 is (TS comma {nuclear, chemical}).

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.090
L2 is secret (S comma {nuclear,
conventional}).

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.710
Using these labels L1 and L2, we're
actually going to be able to decide

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.840
axis control in the end comes
to being able to read and

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.620
write documents because that's
what you do to files or documents.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.880
So we actually, when disclosure or
confidentiality is an issue.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.530
There is a model, Bell and
La Padula model or BLP model

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.490
that makes use of labels exactly like
the L1 and L2 that we have here.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.250
And actually the model is defined by
a set of rules that tell you when,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.430
based on these labels,
you can read or write.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.230
But implementation of
the mandatory access control,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.790
is always going to require
some kind of labels.
