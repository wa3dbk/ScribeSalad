00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.577
Let's say that Chris is super popular. The number of Facebook friends he has is

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:11.291
2.5 standard deviations above the mean. So, in other words, he has more friends

00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:16.802
than about 99% of people. If the true standard deviation of our original data

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:21.902
set is still 36 and the original mean is still 190, then how many Facebook

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:23.805
friends does Chris have?
