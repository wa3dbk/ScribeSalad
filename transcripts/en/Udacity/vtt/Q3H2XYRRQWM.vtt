00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.104
Conveniently, Grant just made the decision that he would like to keep the amount

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:09.939
he spends on nozzles in the next month, at most $10,000. So we have something

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.618
new to add to our what we know list. Assuming Grant maxes out this budget, he

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:19.726
will spend $10,000 total on making nozzles. Thinking about what our variables

00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:24.482
stand for, which one of them could be replaced with 10,000? Do you think it

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.763
belongs in the spot of y, or x, or b?
