00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.736
We know the total amount of money we invested was $10,000. And if I add up the

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:09.661
other amounts together they should total to this. Well I don't know how much I

00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:14.587
invested at 7.5%, that's x. And I don't know how much I invested at 8%, that's

00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:19.165
y. But I know that if I add those two unknown amounts together I should get

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:21.645
$10,000, so this is my first equation.
