00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.285
Here I'm back to tell you how to write conditions in Java. Those conditions

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:08.301
that you can put inside an if statement to make a decision. Often times you

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:11.949
want to compare two values to see which one is smaller, which one is larger and

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:16.660
there are a bunch of operators that you can use. Here's a list of them. A

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.547
couple of them look just like what they look in regular mathematics. The others

00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:25.750
look slightly different. This one here, you would write as greater than or

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.662
equal, or maybe greater than or equal, like that, in math. This one here is a

00:00:31.662 --> 00:00:35.286
less than or equal. This one here is a simple equality, and this one here is a

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:39.512
not equal. Of course, these three symbols were chosen because there's no

00:00:39.512 --> 00:00:44.214
keyboard character , for the mathematical symbols. The equal, equal on the

00:00:44.214 --> 00:00:49.780
other hand was chosen because the plain old equal already has another meaning.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.379
In Java you use the equal, equal for comparison and the single equal sign for

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.673
assignment. If you want to assign a value to a variable, here we want to assign

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:05.077
the number 13 to the variable 4. Then we use the equal sign, and of course

00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:09.407
afterwards, floor is 13. If on the other hand, we want to test whether or not

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:15.300
floor equals 13, then we use the equal, equal comparison symbol. Let's put if

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.950
statements and relational operators to use in a fun graphical way, to draw

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.630
flags. Here you see the flag of Indonesia, as simple as flags get, red on top,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.870
white on the bottom. Here you see the outline of a simple class for drawing a

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.615
flag. Its get color at method, its called for every x and y value in the flag,

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:41.406
your job will be to complete it so that the correct colors appear. You'll

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:44.878
want to know the dimensions of the flag, so that you can decide when to use red

00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:49.516
and when to use white. And they're available to you in these instance

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:54.640
variables. Don't worry about how the get color at method is, called. You can

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.790
actually peek below and see it, but it uses loops, which we only introduce in

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:05.030
the next lesson. Right now your job , is to fill out this method here. Put in a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.660
condition here, select the right colors. And as an added challenge, I want you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.498
to use the greater or equal operator. Now be careful, for exactly half of the

00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:21.885
rows, you want red, and for exactly half of the rows, you want white.
