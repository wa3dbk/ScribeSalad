00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.364
Now, comes a better question. Can we graph this parabola? Well, the equation

00:00:05.364 --> 00:00:09.731
isn't in vertex form. So, we'll need to do something different. We know the

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:14.998
vertex form has a perfect square in it. So, what if we completed the square for

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:20.201
the x terms, so that way we could get a perfect square? Essentially, we want to

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:25.475
change this equation, so it looks like this vertex form. I can group these x

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:30.550
terms together, and then we can add an amount in order to complete the square.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.385
But, since we don't want to complete the square unless the coefficient of this

00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:39.890
x squared term is positive one, let's factor out two from both of these terms.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.030
Now, I haven't completed the square yet but I did factor out a two here and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.562
here. This left me with two times the quantity x squared minus 8x plus 33 on

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:56.252
the end. I'm just leaving a spot here in order to complete the square soon. If

00:00:56.252 --> 00:01:00.410
we were to complete the square here, what number would we put here in order to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.820
have a perfect square? Type that number in right here.
