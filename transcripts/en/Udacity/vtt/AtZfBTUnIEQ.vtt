00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.992
Let's check our new answer. So we're going to plug in 3 plus or minus 4 i in the

00:00:05.992 --> 00:00:12.003
spot of x in our equation. So remember this is either 3 plus 4 i or 3 minus 4 i.

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:18.052
So for now let's just pick one. Let's pick the plus. So if we let x equal 3 plus

00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:22.461
4 i then. What does x minus 3 squared simplify to?
