00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.774
This hyperbola will be centered at 0, 5 give, it will have an a value of 8, and

00:00:04.774 --> 00:00:10.946
a b value of 4. Good thinking if you got these three right. We'll start by

00:00:10.946 --> 00:00:16.660
dividing each of these terms by 64. When we divide this term by 64, we'll

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.972
simplify it by 1 16th. This term divided by 64 turns into negative x squared

00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:28.655
divided by 64. And finally, 64 divided by 64, equals 1. Our y squared term

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:32.065
comes first, which means that our hyperbola needs to open up, an it needs to

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:37.220
open down. There's no number next to the x variable, so that means the center,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.050
or the x coordinate of the center, is 0. The y coordinate of the center would

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.739
be positive 5. This is the k it is always next to y. The a is the number that

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.934
we move in the x direction so that's underneath the the x squared term. It's

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:55.254
the square root of this number. Since the square root of 64 equals 8, we know

00:00:55.254 --> 00:01:00.602
the value of a, it must be 8. For the value of b, we simply take the square

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:05.864
root of 16 which equals 4. We start by graphing the ellipse with a center at 0,

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:11.342
5 and then we move 8 units in the x direction for 2 points. And four units in

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:16.020
the y direction for two more points. Next we draw our dash rectangle around our

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.990
ellipse. Then we draw in the two diagonals. And since we know the y squared

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.230
term is first and is positive, we know our hyperbola opens up and it opens

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.490
down. So we cut our ellipse horizontally. And we flip over these two pieces.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.701
Ultimately, this produces our hyperbola. As a quick check, we can make sure

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:41.765
that these two points are four units vertically away from the center. Our

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:45.795
center is at 0, 5, so yes, this point is four units away vertically, and this

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:50.107
point is four units away in the other direction.
