00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.380
Let's revisit the semantics of LRVM and what it does. So

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.690
this is a time axis, the application when it calls the begin transaction

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.940
primitive of LRVN. What LRVN does is it says,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.890
okay, the application is going to modify some portion of the memory.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.500
So let me create a memory copy of the old contents of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980
the portion of the memory that this transaction

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.310
is going to modify. And that's what is

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.720
called the in-memory undo record of LRVM. In

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.680
the body of the transaction the program is doing

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.780
normal program writes and they are going into

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.800
the memory. No problem with that because LRVM

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.760
has the undo record already stashed away. So

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.370
all of these are writes to normal memory and

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.260
there is no interaction with LRVM during

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.380
this portion of the transaction code. Then

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.610
the application reaches the end transaction, makes

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.490
the end transaction call to LRVM. At that

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.690
point, LRVM is going to write a redo record onto the disk when the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.980
transaction commits, because end transaction is synonymous

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.570
with commiting, so far as LRVM is concerned.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.600
And therefore, at this point, the changes that have been made to virtual memory

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.270
are written out as a redo log record and forced to the disk by LRVM. We know

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.450
disk I/O is slow and the more you do it, the slower will be the subsystem

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.140
that is using these LRVM primitives, and that's

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.150
why LRVM provides the no-flush option in transaction

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.350
call, which allows an applicaiton to tell LRVM write

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.500
it out to the disc but don't stop me

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.680
from progressing further in my computation. In other words,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.400
the applicaiton is hoping that there won't be any failures

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.905
that will result in all the changes that it

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:02.190
recorded in memory not being forced to the disc. So

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.460
the LRVM is going to write out the redo log

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.270
as the background activity and the hope is that there

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.380
won't be any system crash during the time that it takes for it to do. And this

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.340
is what we called as the window of vulnerability

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.150
when we talked about LRVM. So what the no

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.610
flash option does is to increase the vulnerability

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.550
of the system to power failures in favor of

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.094
performance. And that's a calculated risk an application developer

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:32.478
is taking if they specify no-flush optimization in the

00:02:32.478 --> 00:02:35.080
end transaction. So, on the other hand, if

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.680
you are conservative then what you would do is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.410
you let the end transaction have the normal transaction

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.680
semantic ,which to say that adding transaction force the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.030
write of the log into the disc to ensure

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.130
that the log segment has been commmited to the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.400
disc. And only then allow the application to proceed

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.440
further. And at this point, at the commit point,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.650
the other thing that LRVM would do is, in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.500
addition to forcing the log record to the disc,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.250
it will also get rid of the undo record

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.370
because the undo record is no longer needed for

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.740
this transaction since the transaction was successfully committed. And we know

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.140
as a background activity what LRVM does is to update the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.550
original data segments with the changes that have been recorded in the redo logs

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.210
because, as you recall, the data segment contains

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.550
a persistent data which are being brought into memory

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.370
and modified during this transaction. And those changes had

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.700
to be eventually persistent. Right now, they're sitting in

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.030
the redo log records and what the log truncation

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.680
part of the elarvian library does is to read

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.020
the redo log records and apply them to the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.680
data segment and get rid of the redo logs.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.320
So this is the log truncation or clean-up

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.690
of the disk space that is done periodically by

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.030
LRVM. Because in the absence of crashes you have

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.060
to make sure that you clean up the disk

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.050
every once in a while. So the upshot

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.260
of LRVM implementation is there are three copies of

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.700
the VM space, done by LRVM to manage persistence

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.060
for recoverable objects. Of course, it optimizes log force

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.839
by dealing them at transaction endpoint. But

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.160
in implementing LRVM one of the biggest sources

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.890
of vulnerability is power failure. Because if

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.060
you, in fact, use at optimization to defer

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.590
writing out the log record to the permanent storage, then all the work that

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.170
you did in this transaction may actually be wasted if in fact there is a power

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.380
failure before the log force happens. Now

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.240
what does providing a battery-backed DRAM give you?
