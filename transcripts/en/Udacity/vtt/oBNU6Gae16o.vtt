00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We've got a lot to cover and not much time to do it so let's dig right in.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's a game I'm playing online with my friend, Ken.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm winning by a little bit mostly because I got good letters like the Z and so on but Ken is catching up.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's dig right in and come up with our concept inventory. What have we got?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, the most obvious thing, there's a board, there's letters--both letters on the board

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and letters in the hand, and the letters on the board have to form words and in the hand they're not.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There's the notion of a legal play on the board, so RITZY is a word,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and it's a word independent of where it appears, but it's legal to have placed it here

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where it hooks up with another letter, and it wouldn't have been legal to place it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
where it bumps into the H or where it's not attached to anything else.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There's the notion of score and the score for individual letters. Z is worth 10.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
An I is worth 1, and there are scores for a play where you add up the letters.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Part of that is that there are bonuses on the board.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
DL means double letter score. A letter that's placed there gets doubled. DW means double word score.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If any letter of the word is on that square, then the whole word

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
score is doubled, and we also have triples as well.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Somewhere behind the scenes, there's a dictionary

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and all these words are in the dictionary and other combinations of letters are not.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Then not shown here is the notion of a blank tile.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Part of the hand might be a blank that isn't indicating any particular letter,

00:01:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but you're free to use for any one, similar to the way we had jokers in the game of poker.
