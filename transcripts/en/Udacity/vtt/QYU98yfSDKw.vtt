00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.017
Okay Google, send a message to Wayne.

00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:09.408
I'll be at our building in 20 minutes,
can you get Josh and meet me there?

00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:16.489
Okay Google, start a run.

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:28.943
[SOUND] Here's the message.

00:00:28.943 --> 00:00:33.378
I'll be at our building in 20 minutes,
can you get Josh and meet me there?

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:35.816
&gt;&gt; Reply.

00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:37.975
How about we make it five minutes?

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:39.229
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:40.087
Here's your message.

00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:41.783
How about we make it five minutes?

00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:42.968
Do you want to send it?

00:00:45.382 --> 00:00:47.820
&gt;&gt; Cat videos.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.695
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:55.065
&gt;&gt; I'll see you in 20 minutes, Timothy.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:01:05.351
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:06.883
&gt;&gt; I'll see you in five minutes, Wayne.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.956
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:20.930
One, two.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.113
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Ubiquitous Computing.

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:25.900
&gt;&gt; I'm Timothy Jordan,
a Developer Advocate at Google.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.802
&gt;&gt; And I'm Wayne Pakowski,
also a Developer Advocate at Google.

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:32.447
&gt;&gt; And I'm Josh Gordon, and you guessed
it, also a Developer Advocate at Google.

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:34.147
&gt;&gt; As you'll learn in this course,

00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:38.340
Ubiquitous Computing is simply a fancy
phrase for technology that's accessible

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.271
to the user, whenever and
wherever they want or need it.

00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:43.012
&gt;&gt; Perhaps,
they're outside going for a run.

00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:45.636
&gt;&gt; Or having some friends over to
watch cat videos and play games.

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:47.331
&gt;&gt; Or maybe, it's time for a road trip.

00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:50.382
&gt;&gt; Your users can be in any of those
situations, and you don't want

00:01:50.382 --> 00:01:53.786
them to have to think about what device
they need to get to your service.

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:57.340
&gt;&gt; No, you want an experience that
presents itself to the user wherever it

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.058
makes sense.

00:01:58.058 --> 00:02:00.758
&gt;&gt; By building an app that runs
on whatever devices they happen

00:02:00.758 --> 00:02:01.518
to have nearby.

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:04.997
&gt;&gt; In this course, we'll teach you
about the existing platforms and

00:02:04.997 --> 00:02:08.550
tools that can make your app available
on a variety of form factors.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.210
But before we get started, I'll explain
just a little bit more about what

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.170
it means for your app to be ubiquitous.
