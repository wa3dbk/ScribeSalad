00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.600
If you guessed that the regression line goes through the means, the mean of x

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.020
and the mean of y, you're correct. The line of best fit will always go through

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.750
the means of the two variables that we're interested in. Since the mean of x is

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.650
the best estimate for the x values, and the mean of y is the best estimate for

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.650
the y values, the best fit line must go through this point.
