00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.830
So let us look at each one of them. Axiomatic concepts, product concepts, and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.930
exemplar concept in more detail. Let's become with axiomatic concept. And

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.200
axiomatic concept is a concept, it is defined by a formal set of necessary and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.880
sufficient conditions. Geometric objects like a circle are good examples.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.250
Triangles, squares, rectangles, and so on. So as an example, a circle are all

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.100
points in a plane that are equidistant from a single point. And the single point

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.630
is the center of the circle. Now, this is a very formal set of necessary and

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.600
sufficient conditions. Given any other object, you can see whether or

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.720
not the particular object is a circle by looking for this particular condition.
