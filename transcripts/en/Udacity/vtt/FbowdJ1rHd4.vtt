00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.970
I've gone ahead and diagrammed what we're seeing in the JSon over here.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.930
We have an education object, which we see right here.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.000
And then inside of it, we have a schools array, which we can see right here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.900
Key schools, and

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.870
then we know it's value is an array because of these square brackets.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.360
Inside the schools array, we have two school objects.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.330
And each one of which has a majors array, which we can see right here, and well,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.520
as a few other key values.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.220
After our schools, we have our online courses.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.320
Online courses is an array of objects.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.310
Here we have one online course, which is,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.210
well, the one you're taking right now, JavaScript syntax.
