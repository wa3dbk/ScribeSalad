00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.798
The simplest test of genes in the environment is when we compare two sets of

00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:09.370
identical twins. Those who are reared apart, and those who are reared together.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.130
Because they're genetically identical, if genes played no role in personality,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.540
then we'd see a very small correlation or similarity between twins who were

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.720
reared apart, so different environments. Likewise, if environment played no

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.780
role, we would see the same correlations between twins that were raised

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.490
together and those who were raised apart, regardless of where they were raised.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.900
When researchers collected data on personality of relatives including identical

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.869
twins, they found evidence for about 50% of the differences in personality

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:49.228
stemming from genetic influence. So, about half of our personality differences

00:00:49.228 --> 00:00:53.806
are due to our genetic make up. So, you would think that the other half stems

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:58.760
from the environment. And that's essentially true. But, it's not that simple.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.680
We can look at environment in two ways. One that we share with our family and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.287
one that we do not share with our family. So, friends, teachers, role models,

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:10.260
and more.
