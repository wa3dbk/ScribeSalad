00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.660
So, now that we have seen how two or more bit histories work, let's do a

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.045
quiz about them. Let's say we have an

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:12.415
N-BIT History, with a 2-BIT counter per history in

00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:16.735
each predictor entry. Let's say that we need

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:20.090
1,024 entries in order for each branch to,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.930
and each other instruction, to have its own

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.230
entry, so that they don't interfere with each other.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.630
So, for the length of the history of 1, 4, 8 and 16, what

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.716
is the cost of the entire predictor in bits? I'm going to

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:40.292
tell you that the cost with a 1-BIT of History is the

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:45.250
1-BIT History, and two 2-bit counters per entry.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.240
So it's going to 5 bits times 1024. Is this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.640
predictor good for each of the predictors for a pattern of N N N T that

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.650
repeats. And we know already that the 1-bit

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.700
history predictor is not good for this pattern because

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.410
it's too long for it. And finally what is the number of two bit counters in an

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.710
entry that we actually use when trying to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.220
predict the repeating NT pattern? Meaning not taken, taken,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.410
not taken, taken and so on. We already know that

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.220
in the N equals 1 predictor we need to both of our counters, so the

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.070
answer is 2. To further help you, I'm going to tell you that the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.118
cost of N equals 4 predictor should be. The history is 4

00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:40.325
plus 2 bit predictors I need 2 to the 4th on that

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:44.508
times 1,024. You can compute what this is,

00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:47.296
you should put the real number here. So

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:49.948
you should multiply things out for these two,

00:01:49.948 --> 00:01:52.690
here, you should just say yes or no.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.380
Yes, if the predictor will predict this successfully

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.930
after the initial warmup period. Now, if it

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.900
want, and then how many two-bit counters are

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.440
we using for the not taken, taken, not taken,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.810
taken pattern in this particular predictor.
