Iterating over structures like ArrayLists is very important. So let's make sure

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:08.665
you've got this down. Let's return to the getFriends method. It was pretty

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:11.680
convenient that the two string method printed out almost exactly what we wanted

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.710
before. But how would we have printed the names of friends without the two

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.884
string method? Or what if we wanted to use a semicolon instead of a comma? let's

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:23.076
update the getFriends method so that it takes a string separator as a

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:28.162
parameter. It should still return a string. You should use the tester I wrote

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:31.940
to check your code. This method is a little bit like a sum over all the

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.800
elements, but you're putting together a string instead of a sum of numbers and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.024
you'll need to be careful at the edges. You only want to print separators in

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:43.830
between names, you don't want to print one after the last name.
