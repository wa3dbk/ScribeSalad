00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.080
Okay, everybody. Welcome back. This is a little

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.070
mini lesson, we are going to do, talking about how

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.370
to use templates. And we are going to spend a

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.810
lot of time today in our editor and browser,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.310
basically working together to build a few templates in

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.500
a simple web application. So let's start with what

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.390
a basic web application looks like. Here we have

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.060
a, a basic little web application. This is effectively

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.940
the Hotel World homework that you did from lesson,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.549
from the first lesson. And you know as you can

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.920
see it doesn't really do much. It's got one

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.980
handler on slash called main page. Which is here. And

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.640
all it does is it prints the string hello,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.580
Udacity. I've made my main page handler inherit from a

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.910
class called Handler, which I defined up here. And

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.430
this just adds one method called Write. And all write

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.390
is, it just let's me print a string without

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.870
having to type self response.out.write, I can just type

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.500
self .write. And we'll be adding a few more

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.660
helper functions, to this handler, as we go. So we've

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.815
got this basic file here, we've got this basic

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:10.420
app.yamal, you know, nothing, nothing crazy here, this is,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.060
this should all be familiar to you by now.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.440
let's go ahead, and make sure this works. We go

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.350
to our terminal. I'm in the template lesson directory,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.670
where these files are. As you can see, ,we'll run

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.830
the app server, like so I, I prefer to run

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.070
the app server from the terminal so I can just

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.660
see what's going on, and can kill it easily,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.180
it's telling me we're running at local host 8080, so

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.890
let's go ahead and check that out in browser. We'll

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.580
go to local host 8080. We'll load this page, and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.740
we see our text that I typed hello, Udacity!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.590
Let's just make sure everything is working as expected.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.650
I'm just going to change this string, adding a

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.480
few exclamation marks. I'll save this file and the go

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.170
back to our browser and reload, and just make

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.930
sure that everything is working end to end. Okay.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.280
Here I am in the browser. I reload. My

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.700
extra exclamation marks appeared. So we are all good there.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.169
Now in this slide, I'm going to ask you lots

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.430
of questions like, what happens when you do x or

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.970
y or whatever. So try to follow along with

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.740
me as we go. that'll, that'll kind of keep things going

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.220
smoothly. Now you're remember if from the end of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.630
your homework from lesson two um,where we made a basic form, if you want to make

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.770
a basic form we can just return html directly from our handler here. So

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.050
I'm going to add a quick string that represents an HTML form.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.760
I'm going to start with a triple quota string. This is basically

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.050
the python syntax for a multi line string. Anything I type

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.930
between these two triple quotes will just be a part of a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.230
string, including other quotes and such. So, it just makes it

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.200
typing html a little easier. Okay? So, a form tag, remember

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.960
that just starts a form. A little h2 tag, that will

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.770
just add a little title. An input box, type text and we'll

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.430
give it the name food. And the button to

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.790
add this food. Now it looks like we're building

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.740
some sort of food or shopping sort of thing

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.950
and indeed we are, we'll kind of build there as we

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.720
go. But for right now its going to start with

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.090
this basic form. App returns this html and the fact,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.160
I am going to rename this form html, so it's

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.900
little bit easier to see down here. So, let's replace

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.337
this text with form HTML and we will give

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:29.260
this a [UNKNOWN] in the browser. Reload the page. And

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.780
I see a basic form. Now, recall that since

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.940
we didn't set a method on that form, the default

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.910
method is going to be GET. Which means when I

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.170
submit this form, it'll just add that parameter to the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.780
URL. And let's go ahead and see that work. Okay,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.550
so I, typed in a food in the text box.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.780
And when I hit enter, the page reloaded with

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.340
the food I just entered in the URL. Our first

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.350
quiz is going to be. When I type in a

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.600
new food. In this text box and hit add. What

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.950
happens? When I submit a new food in the

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.030
text box, what happens? Choose the correct answer. The food

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.870
parameter in the URL updates to match our new food.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.930
Do we see a second food parameter in the URL,

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.490
so it'll have both steak and eggs in

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.350
the URL. Or, does the browser report an error?
