Afterwards, go ahead and start BlueJ, and follow along what I'm doing here.

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:10.580
Select the Project Option, open a project, navigate to the folder into which

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.011
you have unzipped the starter code, go to lesson one and then to hello, and

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:22.140
here you get an icon that represents out first program. Double-click on it, and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.580
a window pops up with the program code. Here again is the line that I said is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.210
the most important one. We'll have a closer look at the bits and pieces of the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.130
statement later, but right now let me show you how to execute a program. Click

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.670
on the button that says Compile. Now your program is translated from the Java

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.360
language into a lower-level language that the computer can execute efficiently.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.360
We don't normally have to worry about that process, except we have to remember

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.620
to hit the Compile button before running the program. Now back in the main

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.700
display, right-click on this box. Select the second line that contains the word

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.490
main, and that launches the main part of our program. You get a dialogue here

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.310
where you should simply click OK. As soon as you do that, another window pops

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.080
up and [UNKNOWN], here's our greeting, Hello World. Now, of course, I want you

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.820
to change the greeting and print something else, and I want you to show me what

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.770
you did. Here we'll use the Udacity coding environment, and not BlueJay to give

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.620
us any of the code that you have developed. Let me show you that. Whenever we

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.270
want you to submit programming work, you will see a screen such as the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.600
following. Here we give you a bit of starter code, and some instructions on

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.560
what we want you to do. Right now it says, please print Hello Udacity. You can

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.410
type your answer in here. Or even better, you can first do the answer in BlueJ

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.520
and then just paste it in here. To test your program, scroll down and click the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.790
Test Run button. And here you see the program output. Once you're happy, click

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.920
the Submit button. That way we get your work, and get you feedback. In this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.890
case, that it was correct. Now, it's your turn to try it. Sarah will walk you

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.210
through your very first programming assignment. Good luck.
