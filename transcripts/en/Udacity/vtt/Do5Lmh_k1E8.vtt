00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.135
Now, let's see if you can do one on your own. What do you think is the vertex

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:09.095
form of this parabola? I want you to write it here, and I've already listed the

00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:14.130
y equals for you. Once you have the equation in vertex form, also tell me the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.330
vertex.
