00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.910
Problematic buying allows you to use
audience insights and technology.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.160
To tailor messages to the right
person at the right moment

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.880
in the right context.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.910
It was known in the past
as Real-time bidding.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.810
As it helps you respond to Real-time
signals across screens and

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.400
across channels.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.470
But today it's much more than Real
time-bidding, it's everything related to

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.960
media mind decisions, that is done by an
automatic system rather than manually.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.620
For example, if a dog owner was
booking his travel online and

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.600
was interrupted in the middle
to take his dog for a walk.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.620
Problematic buying can help set
an apartment to target this dog owner on

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.730
his phone and make sure he's booking his
apartment on his Smartphone on the go.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.790
The secret here is to really
define your audience well.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.960
If you do this successfully,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.520
you're more likely to send them
the most relevant message.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.940
Research has shown that when an ad is
delivered in real time to an individual,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.980
they're twice as likely
to interact with it.
