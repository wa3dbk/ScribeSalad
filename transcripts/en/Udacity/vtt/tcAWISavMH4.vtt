00:00:00.263 --> 00:00:05.695
And the answer is 177 audits. To calculate this, say

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:08.315
we audit N votes, then the chance of tracing Alison’s vote

00:00:08.331 --> 00:00:12.684
on one mix net is N over 1,000 and to trace it

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:16.315
through four mix nets the probability becomes and

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.442
over a 1,000 to the fourth power, and we want this

00:00:18.442 --> 00:00:23.869
value to be less than 1 over 1,000. Rearranging this

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.661
means we want N to be less than 1,000 to the 3/4

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:30.665
power which we can calculate in python to get

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:34.665
177.8. So N equals 177.
