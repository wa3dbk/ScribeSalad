00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.755
Our coworker Larry, you saw in the first lesson,

00:00:02.755 --> 00:00:05.710
has been putting together a recipes repository.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.840
Carolyn and I like these recipes, but we want to tweak them a little bit to

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.330
be more to our tastes so that we can then share them with our friends.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.800
Larry's okay with us sharing our modified versions, but

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.890
he wants to keep his version as it is.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.310
Since Carolyn and I both want to make changes and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.960
we want others to see it, hosting our versions on GitHub would be a perfect fit.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.420
It would be possible to get a copy up on GitHub doing only things that we've

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.790
already talked about.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.670
First, we could take Larry's repository and clone it, to say,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.050
Caroline's computer.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.680
This would automatically set up Larry's repository as a remote called Origin.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.320
Then we could create a new repository on GitHub on Caroline's account.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.710
She could then set up this new repository as a remote,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.580
which she could call whatever she wanted, say Our version.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.880
She can then push the changes to the remote, as we've seen before.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.160
And then since I want to contribute to this repository, as well,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.610
I could clone it to my computer, setting up Caroline's version as origin.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.910
This is pretty involved,, and it also doesn't give Larry any recognition for

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.400
the work that he did on his original repository.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.120
Since there's no way somebody looking at ,Our Version,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.090
can have any idea about Larry's, unless we link to it explicitly.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.050
To get a similar effect with less work on our part,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.600
GitHub has a feature called Forking.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.970
This allows you to make a copy of somebody else's repository directly on

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.330
the GitHub servers without pulling down the code to your local machine first.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.310
You can fork an existing repository and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.880
have it appear under your own account with just a single click.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.320
Then to make your modifications, you'd likely want to pull down the code onto

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.200
your own machine, unless the files are simple enough to edit directly on GitHub.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.360
Forking is a lot like cloning.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.770
In fact, a fork is just a clone that GitHub makes for you on their own machines.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.990
There are a few other side effects to forking.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920
Like GitHub keeping track of the number of people who've made forks on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.390
your repository.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.530
And the forks all linking back to the original.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.500
It also makes it easier to suggest changes back to the original repository,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.150
which we'll cover in detail later in the lesson.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.550
So, since Larry's version is already on GitHub,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.210
forking makes a lot of sense in this case.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.538
Caroline can make the fork on her account.

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:13.120
Then we can each clone our new version.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.330
The clones don't need to know anything about the original repository.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.170
Since there are a lot of related concepts in the space of different ways to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.080
version your code, we want to make sure that everything makes sense so far.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.890
Each of the following diagrams represents either creating a branch, a fork, or

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.910
a clone.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.290
Use the text boxes to indicate which concept is represented by each diagram.
