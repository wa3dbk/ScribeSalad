00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.100
Let's just have a look for a minute at the let clause,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.730
which is way of doing a local abbreviation or a local definition.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.870
Say you have you a relatively complex computation that you're going to

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.630
include in one of your constraints, and you're going to use it more than once.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.600
Now, you could type it out more than once, but that's extra effort and

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.020
you might make a mistake. So instead, you could use a let clause to

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.520
introduce a new identifier that has the value of that expression, and

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.600
then use that identifier in a subsequent constraint. So for example,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.300
if our income is expressed in terms of the sum of our of our salaries for

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.350
all of our jobs, okay, we could use a let clause which says exactly that.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.467
We could introduce a new variable, or

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:56.270
identifier called income and then we could have expression, in this case is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.090
an if then else expression that says if someone is unemployed then their income

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.610
is less than 100 else their income is greater then or equal to 100. It's just as

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.360
if we've typed in the long expression in both the places where we used to.
