Hopefully, these first two were pretty easy for you because I told you what to

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:06.484
type. But for these last two, which probably were a bit more complicated than

00:00:06.496 --> 00:00:09.798
earlier ones, you can now see exactly which key you should type to get these

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.206
expressions. If you had trouble with this, just go back and practice it again.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.423
We're going to keep using this throughout the entire course, so it's super

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:19.925
important that you feel comfortable with this. I know it might feel a little bit

00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:23.336
funny at first, but I'm sure as you play around with it more, it'll become a lot

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:24.517
more natural and intuitive.
