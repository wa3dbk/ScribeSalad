00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All of these strategies come from a chapter named "The Devil's Guide To Debugging,"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which was written by a guy named Steve McConnell.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The book is being called Code Complete in 1993 and it encompass all the wisdom

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
about programming that Steve McConnell had at that time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What we've seen so far is just three of these rules.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The first one is to scatter output statements everywhere in the code.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Output whatever you want, where you want it, just put it in there such that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you will always be able to figure out what was going on or not.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The second one is to debug the program into existence.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Just keep on adding statements and removing statements until it works.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Never ever backup earlier versions of your code.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I mean who can't remember what he or she has done just 7 minutes ago.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Rule number 4, don't bother understanding what the program should do.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I mean, it's obvious isn't it. If it's not obvious, make it obvious.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
My all time favorite though is number 5, use the most obvious fix.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That means fix the symptom instead of the problem.
