00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Buffer overflows are also the topic of one of my most favorite bug story

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which was reported by Isenstadt in '97.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He once had a system that would work only under very specific circumstances,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The crucial parts of memory in this story are two variables,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
one is the day of the week and the other one is a variable which we will simply call ok.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Ok can take a value which is either yes or no.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
By default in this story, ok would be set to no.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
However, ok has to be set to yes in order to work.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, the day of the week in this eight character array would be something say like Monday,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and on Monday, the program would not work.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It also would not work on Sunday.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It wouldn't work on Tuesdays either but there would be one day of the week

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and only on this day of the week where the program would work just fine.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What is this day over to you.
