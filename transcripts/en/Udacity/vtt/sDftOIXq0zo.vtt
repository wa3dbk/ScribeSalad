00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.686
This would be the answer for t. Fantastic work if you found it. We start by

00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:09.128
multiplying both sides by the denominator, s plus t. This would give us 3s

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:14.286
squared plus 3st on the left and 4rt on the right. We just had to distribute

00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:18.385
this 3s to each of these terms. Next we subtract 3st from both sides of the

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:24.033
equation. This allows us to get nothing but t terms on 1 side. Now that we have

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:27.930
terms of t on 1 side, and everything else on the other. We can factor a t out

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.988
from these terms. We'll have t times the quantity, 4r minus 3s. We divide both

00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:38.450
sides of our equation by this quantity to get t alone. These reduce to 1,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.696
leaving us with t equals this expression. I hope you're starting to see some

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:46.013
patterns when solving these equations.
