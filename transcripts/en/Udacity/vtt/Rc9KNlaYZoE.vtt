Graph C and B are pretty easy to identify, since they're just linear equations.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.494
So, they go with h of x and k of x. A and D are the two absolute value

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:14.810
functions, so they are the functions f and g. We can figure out which one is

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.302
which by plugging in a few numbers. Let's say, x equals 0, for example. For f

00:00:20.302 --> 00:00:24.450
of x that gives us f of 0 equals the absolute value of negative 3 or a 3, which

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.750
is what we see in graph D. The same thing with g gives us g of 0 equals

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.870
negative 3, which is going with graph A.
