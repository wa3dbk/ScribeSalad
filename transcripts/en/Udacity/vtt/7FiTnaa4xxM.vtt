00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.240
This first question requires a bit of explanation,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.750
so bare with me here. The goal of

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.000
this question is to find an app on

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.560
a Play Store that has low ratings. Then, we're

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.309
going to estimate how much of that low rating

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.830
came from violated constraints. So the way we're going to

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.170
do this is by going to the Google

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.750
Play store. And we're going to find an app with

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.770
a relatively low review. Let's say below three and

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.340
half stars. So I just clicked on this app. Looks

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.800
like it has a review of about three and

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.500
a half stars. And notice if I scroll down, I

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.520
can see what the actual average rating is. But

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.754
I can also see were that rating came from. 720

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:47.780
five star reviews, 310 one star, and so on. But

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.970
beyond that I can also click into the individual reviews.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.700
&gt;From this page I can look at reviews

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.640
by Newest, Helpfulness or Rating, which will be especially

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.520
helpful for this exercise. And then I can

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.700
read individual reviews. Apparently this person's upset that this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.280
app requires camera and microphone permission. In this

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.700
question you're actually going to read a lot of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.950
reviews with different star ratings of an app that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.200
has an overall pretty low rating. And as you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.920
read you're going to pay attention to how many

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.250
of these reviews reference violated mobile constraints, as a reason

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.350
for the low rating. As you read these reviews,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.880
you're going to be filling out this table. So the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.960
rows represent the number of stars, and this column

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.590
is the total number of reviews with this star rating.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.390
This column is where you'll keep track of the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.990
total number of reviews you read with that star rating.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.500
So, let's say you had looked at five one

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.140
star reviews and three those had violated mobile constraints. You're

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.640
going to go through this table, fill out all of

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.350
these fifteen boxes, and at the end when you hit

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.950
submit, over on the right side here where you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.110
get your feed back the apps current rating will be

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.680
calculated. You should already know that but his will

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.310
be a sanity check. It's predicted rating, if no mobile

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.800
constraints had been violated, will be calculated as

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.100
well. Now this prediction is of course a prediction,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.250
it's an estimate, and it comes from the assumption

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.410
that one, the reviews you read were somehow representative

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.890
of people who gave one star reviews or two

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.850
star reviews. But, also there are some assumptions baked

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.280
in about, well, if you'd given it a one

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.650
star review and said there was a violated constraint.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.710
You probably would of given it a three or four star review, had

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.900
there been no constraint violated. You can

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.320
read more about those assumptions in the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.000
instructor notes, and if you have any questions, I understand this is a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.940
bit of a confusing question, feel free to post them in the discussion forum.
