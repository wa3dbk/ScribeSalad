00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.737
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So we know functions are a special relationship between a set of inputs and a

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:09.362
set of outputs. This can work for objects and it can also work for numbers.

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:14.044
Here's a set of numbers and here's another set of numbers. When we think of a

00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:18.452
coordinate point, we usually think of the x as the input and the y as the

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:23.648
output. So these would be inputs, and these would be the corresponding outputs.

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:28.473
Knowing that information, is this set of order pairs a function? And is this set

00:00:28.473 --> 00:00:33.096
of ordered pairs a function? Write yes or no in these boxes. As a hint, make a

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:37.832
list of the inputs and the outputs, just like before, and then draw the arrows

00:00:37.832 --> 00:00:39.622
to map it out. Try your best.
