00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.412
We've encountered several situations in which the slope of a line was the

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:08.991
coefficient of a term that an x to the first in our equation. But my question

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:13.729
is, does this hold true in all cases? For which of these equations down here do

00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:18.194
you think that the slope of the line is the coefficient of the term with an x to

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:22.166
the first in it? I know that you may not have an idea of what the graphs of each

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:26.069
of these equations look like. But think about the form of the equations that

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:29.804
we've looked at so far, and which equations down here might have the same

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:31.609
graphical properties as those ones.
