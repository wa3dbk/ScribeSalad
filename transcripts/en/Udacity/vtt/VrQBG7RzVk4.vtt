00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.604
So here is a,
what's referred to as an audio spectrum.

00:00:02.604 --> 00:00:06.563
And at the top up here that's a,
a waveform.

00:00:06.563 --> 00:00:09.023
That's the actual signal coming in,
that's,

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:11.980
a voltage is a function of
time going into a speaker.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.770
And what this is, this is what's
referred to as a audio spectrum,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.640
short term for a decomposition.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.830
Basically, you've got low
frequency stuff down here,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.100
high frequency stuff down here
with time going that way.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.950
And the question is,
that's a sound, what sound is that?

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.822
Obviously, it's the song spectrum.

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:37.515
It's the spectrum of the Prothonotary
Warbler, or, or War, Warbler.

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:39.465
Obviously, I'm not a bird person, okay?

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:40.495
There's a picture of one.

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:44.755
But the idea is, if you listen to this
bird chirp, and then you process it

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:48.215
over time, or actually, you listen to
it chirp over time and you process it,

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.845
you would see this audio spectrum.

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:54.575
And the spectra of different birds,
of course, are different.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:58.045
Here's two different birds,
the Prothonotary Warbler, and

00:00:58.045 --> 00:00:59.700
the Chestnut-sided Warbler.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.690
But what you can see is that the spectra
are really quite different, all right?

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.660
And, the goal is to think about
these things as what's referred

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.920
to as time series, and
how would you distinguish between them.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.100
So, for a given time series,
there are questions you can ask,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.040
like which bird is this, okay?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.130
So like, you've, you've got, you've
got an audio signal, which bird is it?

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.700
How long is this thing
going to keep going?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.510
Is this bird sick?

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.442
Right?
That is, you know, somehow not normal.

00:01:31.442 --> 00:01:35.444
And are there different sort of elements
or different phases that the book, the,

00:01:35.444 --> 00:01:36.145
the bird has.

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:39.920
And when you think of these in a time
series context which bird it is,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.885
that's a classification problem.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.775
Time series classification,
how long will it continue,

00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:47.155
might have something
to do with prediction.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:47.925
Is this bird sick?

00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:50.005
Would be an outlier detection.

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:53.570
And finally,
you get the notion of segmentation.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.398
So that would be for like bird data.

00:01:54.398 --> 00:01:57.150
Well, how about other time series data?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.200
Here's some.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.710
So, you know,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.600
here's stock data of different types of
indices over different amounts of time.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.940
And you might have questions
that you would ask like,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.470
will this stock go up or down?

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.758
Something we all want to know.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.810
What type of stock is this?

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.320
Right?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.660
If you had a set of
categories of stocks.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.110
And, is this stock behaving
the way it normally does?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.300
And that becomes just like we saw
before, prediction classification,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.410
or outlier detection.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.945
Here's another example.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:31.560
Supposed you were listening to
the audio of this music, right?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.450
So not looking at the imagery
of the score of, of the,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.710
of the music itself as shown here, but
actually listen to somebody playing it.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.903
You might ask things like, you know,
is this Bach or Beethoven,

00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:43.542
which would be classification.

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:45.125
Can we make more of that?

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.701
That's now a generative
model kind of question.

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:50.254
And computer music people are always
interested in listening to some music.

00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:55.240
Could I have a machine produce
more music of that sort of type?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.090
And can we sort of divide this up into,
into segments?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.650
So this is what's referred to
as time series segmentation.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.586
By the way, this bottom one is,

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:08.430
segmentations receive
a lot of attention lately.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.770
Something called conditional random
field is being applied to it.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.050
We're not going to talk about that,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.870
we're going to talk
about mark-up models.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.850
But I just wanted to point out that you
might not use what we're going to learn

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.950
today so much for

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.730
segmentation as much as you would for
some of the classification things.
