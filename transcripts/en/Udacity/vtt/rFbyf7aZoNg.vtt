00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.900
How did it go writing the code to save

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.650
the profile in the datastore? Let's take a quick look

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.570
at the code. Here I am, the saveProfile method.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.670
And we'll scroll down to where we create the profile

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.666
and save it. So we already have this line

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.999
of code to create the profile and then saving it

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:22.683
in the entity was this simple, ofy.save.entity(profile).now. Okay, now

00:00:22.683 --> 00:00:25.740
let's see what properties show up in the datastore admin.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.850
So here we are in the Datastore Viewer looking

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.600
at the profile entity for my profile Lemon Cake.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.140
See here, we have to display name and the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.510
other properties that we see are the mainEmail and the

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.460
teeShirtSize. The property that's missing is User ID. The

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.720
User ID was specified as the ID for the entity

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.150
and it's used in the entity key. The ID

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.980
field isn't saved as a separated property on the entity.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.720
Okay, let's go back and hear what Magnus has to say next.
