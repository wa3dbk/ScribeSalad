00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
Now, before we actually do step two, let's have a brief review of what step two actually means.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.660
So, to show that shortest tour is NP-hard, which would then make it NP-complete,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.060
because we've already shown that it is in NP,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.330
what do we need to show?

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.390
Do we need to show that the input for some NP-complete problem

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.380
can be transformed into an input for shortest tour.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.710
And, of course, if this input here is a yes for this NP-complete problem,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.220
then it has to be yes for shortest tour here as well.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.450
If it's the no it's has to be a no.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.170
Or do we need to show that the input for shortest tour can be transformed

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.260
into an input for some other NP-complete problem?

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.260
Basically, I would like you to review here which direction these transformations work.

00:00:38.260 --> 99:59:59.000
Of course, we'll always make the assumption that the transformation is in polynomial time.
