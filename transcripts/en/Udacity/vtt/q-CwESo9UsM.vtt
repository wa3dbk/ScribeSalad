00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.040
Now that we understand the" happened before" relationship

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.300
and the transitivity of" happened before" relationship. I also

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.220
want to introduce this notion of concurrent events.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.150
That is, concurrent events are events in which there

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.190
is no apparent relationship between the events. So,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.630
for instance, I'm showing you two nodes of the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.440
disterbent system. A is an event on one node, and b is an event on another node,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.970
and you can see that since a and b are not events on the same node we cannot

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.900
apply the sequential process condition to say that there

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.150
is an ordering between a and b, and by the

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.630
same token, since a is an event here, b

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.570
is an event here And there is no communication between

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.080
these two guys that connections these events in any

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.510
shape or form, either directly or transitively. There is no

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.180
ordering between a and b, and therefore these two

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.320
events are concurrent events, not sequential events, not connected

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.330
where they happened before relationship, but they're concurrent events.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.569
So, in other words, We cannot say anything about

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.280
the ordering of a and b in the distributed

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.310
system. So, this is the fun thing about a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.580
distributed system is that has "Happened Before" relationship which

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.300
looks at either events on the same process or

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.630
events across process is connected by communication and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.485
the transitivity of "Happened Before" relationship Through the native

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:29.200
happened-before relationships give at best a partial order

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.340
for all the events that are happening in the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.250
system, so there's no way for us to

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.410
derive a total order by looking at the events

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.420
that are happening on the same process or just

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.060
looking at the events that are happening on the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.940
different processes. In the distributed system and this is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.200
a very good example why it's impossible to get a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.600
total order for all the events that are happening

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.110
in the distributed system. Because there are events they are

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.330
going to be concurrent, that's the nature of the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.510
game that these procesors are executing asynchronously with respect to

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.470
one another and therefore The event that is happening

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.090
over here. You know, if I want to look at wall

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.639
clock time in one execution of the distributed program,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.880
it's possible that a in real time, happened before

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.560
b but the same program when I execute it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.580
again, the second time around, it could be that

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.580
this event b happened before a. And therefore, these

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.780
2 events are called concurrent events. So the important

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.680
point about these concurrent events that happened before relationship

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.290
is that And structuring a distributed algorithm. It's important to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.120
recognize what events are connected by the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.300
happened before relationship, and what events are concurrent

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.530
events, and once you have an understanding

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.350
of these two concepts, then you can build

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.120
robust distributed systems and robust applications. Because

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.640
if you have any assumptions about the ordering

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.240
of events that are unconnected by communication like

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.930
this, that can lead to an erronious program.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.040
So one of the bane of distributed programs

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.230
is synchronization and communication bugs and timing bugs. And

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.810
this is a classic example. Of a timing bug

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.240
that you can have if you mentally think that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.330
A happened before B and that's the way you

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.940
want it to happen. It may not happen. Because

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.580
these two events are concurrent events. Now that I've

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.210
introduce to you all important basics of events and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.640
ordering of events in distributed system. It's time for another quiz.
