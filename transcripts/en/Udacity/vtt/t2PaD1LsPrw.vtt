00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.926
When we subtract 5 from both sides, we have a new inequality, or a new version

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:09.712
of our old inequality. We have 18 minus X over 3 X minus 6 minus 5 is less than

00:00:09.712 --> 00:00:14.039
0. We want to make it, though, so that everything on the left side of our

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.785
inequality is part of a single rational expression. In order to make this all

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:23.249
one fraction we need to start by getting this extra term, the minus five, to

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.856
have the same denominator as the first term. So, what would the numerator of an

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:32.287
equivielent fraction that's equal to five be if the denominator is 3x minus 6?

00:00:32.287 --> 00:00:36.782
Remember, I've already written the sign out here, so we're going to subtract all

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:38.473
of whatever you write in here.
