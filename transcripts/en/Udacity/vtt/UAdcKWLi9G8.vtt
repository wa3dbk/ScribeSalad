00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What I'll do next is to give you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
another programming assignment.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Rather than printing out the particles themselves,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I want you to print out the overall

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
quality of the solution

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and to do this, I've programmed for you an "eval" code

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which takes in as a robot position

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and a particle set,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it computes the average error

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of each particle, relative to the robot pos

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in "x" and "y"--not in the orientation.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the way it does it, it basically compares

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the "x" of the particle with the "x" of the robot,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
computes the Euclidian distance

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
of these differences, and averages all of those.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So it sums them all up

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it averages them, through the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
number of particles over here, which is upper caps N.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, there's some funny stuff over here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The reason is, the world is cyclic

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and it might be that the robot is at 0.0 or at 99.9.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's about the same values

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but, according to this calculation over here, they'd be different.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So while there's normalization over here,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I make sure that the cyclicity of the world

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
doesn't really affect negatively

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the estimated error I've enclosed in the boundary.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You might parse this.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm adding "world_size" over to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the computer model operation and then

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
subtract the same thing over here--I can't even see it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's just too long a line.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Be that as it is, I want you to take the function, "eval",

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and produce a sequence of performance evaluations.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And if we hit the run button,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I want you to produce something like this stuff over here:

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
4.9, 3.6, 2.9, 2.8, 3.1.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is the residual error.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Remember, it's a world of size 100 by 100,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so this is actually a relatively small error,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
compared to the world's size.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Can you code it so I get, for each iteration,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.741
the error number produced by this routine over here?
