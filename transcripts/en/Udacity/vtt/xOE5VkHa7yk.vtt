00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.308
N plus two divided by the quantity three M plus fifteen is correct. Nice work

00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:09.406
for getting either of these correct. We'll start by finding the lowest common

00:00:09.406 --> 00:00:13.957
denominator for these two fractions. We'll find the common factors for N plus

00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:19.826
five. And m plus two. Make sure that you don't put a single m here. They have a

00:00:19.826 --> 00:00:24.790
term of m, but they don't have a common factor of m. And it's because we have

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.948
addition between each of these terms. Multiplying by the L-C-D divided by the

00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:35.120
L-C-D, we can see that the factors that m plus five cancel out. These equal one.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.909
Likewise, in the denominator of the complex fraction M plus 2 divided by m plus

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.523
2 equals 1. This leaves us with 3 times m plus 2 for our numerator. And 9 times

00:00:46.523 --> 00:00:51.180
m plus 5 for our denominator. We can simplify these numbers, since they're

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.427
factors that appear in the numerator and denominator. 3 9ths reduces to 1 3rd.

00:00:56.427 --> 00:01:02.826
We just divide each number by 3. Finally we distribute our 3 to get n plus 2

00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:06.803
divided by 3m plus 15, our final answer.
