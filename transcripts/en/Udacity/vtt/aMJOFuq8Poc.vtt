00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.550
To see the key value pairs that are stored

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.400
for a particular site or scheme host port combination, you

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.780
can open up the chrome developer tool, go to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.450
the Resources tab and select Local storage. Note that there

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.140
is Local storage which persists across reloads and sessions

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.660
storage which has the same API but it's isolated by

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.330
tab and it's cleared at the end of the session.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.010
So whenever the page is closed down, the Sessions Storage

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.580
goes away. Now, remember, you can only store text

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.880
in local storage, so if you wanted to store

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.550
an image or some other binary data type, you'd

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.310
have to first base64 and code it. And of

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.130
course, you only get typically about 5MB per domain,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.750
so you're not going to be able to store very

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.130
much. So now it's your turn. Use local storage

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.750
to store the value "bar" for the key "foo"
