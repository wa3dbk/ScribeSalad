00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.690
For the past few questions, we've looked at equations that we can treat as

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.810
linear equations, up to a certain point, of course. But we spent a bunch of

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.080
time in this course, also talking about quadratic equations. And in fact, we're

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.480
going to need to use those techniques as well for certain equations that use

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.720
exponents. Let's look at example of one of those right now. Here we have e to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.690
the 2x minus 5e to the x plus 6 equals 0. Now, it might not look like it right

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.960
away, but this is actually a quadratic equation in e to the x. To see this more

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.470
clearly, let's make a little substitution. Let's let u equal e to the x. How

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.100
then, would you rewrite the first 2 terms of our equation in terms of u? Please

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.143
fill in these pink spots with the proper numbers, variables, or expressions.
