00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.469
Now that you've seen
expert do user research,

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.230
take some time to do it yourself.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.680
Go to the last person you chose in the
last quiz, and sit down with them and

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.000
conduct your research.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.960
It's very likely some of your feedback
will be the same as the feedback

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.160
we just got.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.059
But it's also very likely that
some of it will be different.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.860
Remember, the important parts here
are to avoid guiding the user too much,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.130
to make a note of where
they get confused and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.260
to see how they go about doing
the things you ask them to do.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.630
Check the box here
[SOUND] when you're done.
