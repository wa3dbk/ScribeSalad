00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.110
Since the bus travels 10 miles per hour slower than the van, we can use x minus

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.726
10 for the bus's rate. We know the bus can travel 200 miles, so that distance

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:14.323
is 200. Our van on the other hand travels 240 miles in that same amount of

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:19.970
time, and if we remember from before. We know distance equals rate times time.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.805
So we know time is equal to the distance divided by the rate. So to find the

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:29.900
amount of time it takes the bus to travel 200 miles, we takes 200 and we divide

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.778
it by the rate, x minus 10. This is our expression for time. And for the van,

00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:42.426
we take its distance, 240, and we divide it by its rate which is x. And here's

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:47.336
our complete table. Great work if you found most of these answers. Even more

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:51.090
amazing if you got them all correct, even if it wasn't your first try.
