00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.615
Let's recap what you've done.

00:00:01.615 --> 00:00:05.895
You've replaced the conventional linked
list representation with one based on

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:06.475
arrays.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.280
With that you're now
ready to go parallel.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.465
To help you do that, I'm going to give
you a handy primitive called a jump.

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:15.940
Here's a picture of a jump.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.370
Oh wait, sorry, wrong picture.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.790
Let's try again.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.960
Suppose you're looking at
a specific linked list node.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.340
In a jump, you move the next pointer so

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.910
that it points to
the neighbor's neighbor.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.710
So take this next pointer,
for example, and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.820
let's replace it with a pointer
to the neighbor's neighbor.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.620
Now, think about this for a second.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.420
What the!

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.810
Bad billy goat!

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.414
What would happen,
if at every node in the list,

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.519
you did a jump at exactly the same time?

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.290
Let's try it and see.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.590
So here's the list.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.800
At every node, do a jump.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.202
Notice what you've just done.

00:00:48.202 --> 00:00:51.920
You've effectively split
the list into two sub lists.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.610
As you can imagine, that's exactly what
you need to do divide and conquer.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.790
Now if you keep doing this, these sub
lists will get shorter and shorter and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.440
you'll get more and more of them.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.810
Jump.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.640
Given a set of next pointers as input,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.700
you can perform a jump in
parallel using this algorithm.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.390
And notice that the new algorithm puts
the jump pointers in a new output array

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.450
called N sub out.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.940
So for each node i, we check to
see if the next pointer is nil and

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.860
if it's not, we do a jump.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.520
By placing the output in a separate
output array, we avoid collisions and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.260
that's what makes it
safe to use parallel for.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.700
Okay, you're almost ready for
the parallel list ranking algorithm.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.320
So far you've seen three ideas.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.260
The first is to store
the list as an array pool.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.880
The second is to recognize the list
ranking is roughly an add scan.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.310
Of course you need to set
the right initial values.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.320
And finally if we have a jump operation,
we can do divide and conquer.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.420
Go ahead and put these ideas together.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.970
You've established that a linked
list has an equivalent array pool

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580
representation.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.825
So when I sketch the algorithm,
I'll draw a linked list in the old

00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:01.662
fashioned way, but you always know
that there's an array pool equivalent.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:05.240
What about treating the list
ranking as an add scan?

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.560
Remember that the key idea here was to
choose the right set of initial values

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.949
at each node.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.400
So we put a 0 at the head and
1's everywhere else.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.110
So now we can apply the third idea
which is to use jumps to get sublists.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.080
If you jump repeatedly, you know the sub
list will get shorter and shorter.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.310
At the same time,
you'll be transforming this list, so

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.150
you're going to have to do something
with these initial values.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.280
How about this,
let's maintain an invariant.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.800
The invariant will be,
if we take any node i, and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.690
we start at the head of its sub list,
and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.830
then let's say we traverse the sub list,
and we add up all the values.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.260
Then we'll get exactly the rank of i.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.390
So for the initial values,
you can easily check that this holds.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.690
Now suppose I've done a bunch of jumps
and I'm looking at a particular sublist.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.500
So here I'm just in
the middle of some sublist.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.410
And let's further suppose
that the invariant holds.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.520
Now let's jump everywhere
simultaneously.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.820
You'll get a list that looks like this.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.638
Now notice what happened.

00:03:04.638 --> 00:03:09.426
For this node here, we effectively
cut 4 out of its sublist, but

00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:12.141
we need to maintain this invariant.

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:16.270
So we can't just drop the value 4,
we've got to incorporate it somehow.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.950
An easy way to do that would
just be to absorb 4's value.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.977
So 12 would become 16.

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:26.898
The way this can work is before we do a
jump from 4, we take the value of 4 and

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:29.280
push it to its successor.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.120
Okay.
Let's give this a try.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.090
Let's do one step of the update and
jump.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.280
For the update every node pushes
its value to its successor.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.150
Then we do the jump to
create two sublists.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.666
And let's just repeat this process.

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:46.528
Push, jump,

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:50.390
push, jump.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.970
Once every node is a stand
alone node you are done.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.480
Now I already gave you
a subroutine to perform the jumps.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.380
What about the updates?

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.180
Here's an algorithm for
just the update step, which is parallel.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.310
So for each node i, we take its value
and we push it to the successor..

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.230
We'll do all the rights to
a separate array of ranks.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.080
This way we can do all
these updates in parallel.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.709
Okay.
You're now almost ready to see

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.570
the final algorithm.
