Okay, time for a quiz. Now that we've
talked about the commutative property of

00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:10.048
multiplication. Let's see if you can apply
it when we're dealing with this term right

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.651
here. 10 times m times 23 times 7.
I would like you to check off all of the

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:18.700
expressions down here that are equal to
this term. Just a hint, there are probably

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:21.280
going to be several that are right
answers.
