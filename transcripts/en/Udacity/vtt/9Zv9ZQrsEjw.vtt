00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What I'd like to talk about now is a little bit more detail

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
on some of the different ways that we have to generate random inputs

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to our software under test.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So let's start off with our diagram showing the random test case generator.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you recall from the diagram a little bit earlier in this unit,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
this test case generator has 2 inputs.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It takes pseudo-random numbers from a pseudo-random number generator,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it's also predicated on some amount of knowledge of the input domain,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and that's supplied by a human.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We already looked at one example--testing the outer--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
where essentially no domain knowledge was needed.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That is to say, the random test case generator pretty much took its pseudo-random numbers

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and used them directly as test cases.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We looked at a different example--that is to say, the credit card number generator--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
where pseudo-random numbers, part of the input,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and they weren't directly parroted to the output

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but rather they parameterized an algorithm which created valid credit card numbers.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And of course it's possible to carry that kind of logic farther,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
as in the example of where we're testing a file system

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and we need to generate valid sequences of API calls

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
or testing a web browser where we need to actually generate well-formed HTML

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
in order to test certain parts of the browser.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But it turns out all of these ways of generating input are variations on a single theme

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which we call generative random testing.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Generative random testing simply means that inputs are created from scratch.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
There's an entirely different approach called mutation-based random testing.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Inputs are created by randomly modifying existing non-randomly created inputs

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to the software under test.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And so what that does is changes our diagram a little bit

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so that we have a separate source of input which is the existing test case.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
One thing we might ask ourselves is, which approach is better?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
As far as I know, there is no cut-and-dried answer to that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Sometimes generative works really well;

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
sometimes mutation-based testing works really well,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and it really just depends on the situation and how much time you have to spend.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In general, my view is that generative testing might be a little bit better

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
at ferreting out really weird errors, but it's a lot more work to create entire random tests--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
at least if there are sophisticated constraints on their form--from scratch.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Mutation testing, on the other hand, has a different strength, so let's take a look at that.
