00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.000
What's a mission statement, and
how do you write one for your startup?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.310
Let's define what a mission statement
is, what questions it should answer,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.880
and then go over some guidelines you
can use to write one for your business.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.010
So first, what is it?

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.965
A mission statement Is a statement
of your company's functions,

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:17.715
market, and goals.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:20.635
The purpose of your mission statement
is to ground your big dream,

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:23.410
in terms of the steps you
plan to take to reach it.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.965
You'll focus on what you're
capable of right now and

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:28.145
what you can achieve in the near future.

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.215
There's a few basic questions
that a mission statement

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:31.915
should be able to answer.

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:33.255
What do you do?

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:34.555
Who do you do it for?

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:36.530
And how do you do it?

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.120
Your mission statement should take
the vision you've created and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.870
define what you plan
to do to achieve it.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.500
So how long should your
mission statement be?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.230
This is similar to a vision statement,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.020
in that there's no set
length that it needs to be.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.450
Some mission statements can
be a single sentence and

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.230
some can be a full paragraph, just make
sure you're providing the clarity needed

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.480
to give direction to you and your team.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.249
Focus on the actual value that
you provide to your users.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.420
For example,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.660
Google's vision is to provide access to
the world's information in one click.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.310
But their mission statement
is a little more specific.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.070
Google's mission is to organize
the world's information and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.440
make it universally accessible and
useful.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.330
Do you see how their
mission statement describes

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.180
the way in which they plan
to achieve their vision?

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.210
They organize information and
make it accessible.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.640
Try to provide a similar clarity for
your mission statement.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.330
So, now that you know a little more
about the purpose of a mission

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.100
statement, take some time to come
up with one that you could use for

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.640
your company.
