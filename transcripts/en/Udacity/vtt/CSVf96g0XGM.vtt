00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.480
There's a lot of noise in our graph since we are

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.450
plotting the mean of y for every possible tenure x value.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.740
Recall from lesson four that we can adjust this noise by

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.540
bending our x-axis differently. Let me show you one of those changes

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.309
in the bend width. Here's our code from before, and instead

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.080
of using tenure here, I'm going to replace this with a different version

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.190
or formula so that way I can bend some of the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.110
tenures together. Now let's see the difference when I plot this graph.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.920
Notice how I have slightly less noise in my plot.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.380
We still see some of the same peaks from before,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.290
especially here, but it's much smoother in general. Here's another

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.370
one using the number 30 instead of the number seven

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.320
and here's a graph with very high bias, but much

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.110
less variance using the number 90. Here I plotted all

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.470
the graphs so we could compare it to the original

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.370
one. Notice that as the bin size increases we see less

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.860
noise on the plot. Our estimates are adjusted

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.010
since we have more data points for our new

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.090
values of tenure. In lesson four we introduce

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.770
smoothers as one tool for an analyst to use

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.670
in these types of situations. So instead of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.100
using gm line here, I'd like you to use

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.380
gm smooth, to add a smoother, to this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.490
plot. Try doing this, in this next programming assignment.
