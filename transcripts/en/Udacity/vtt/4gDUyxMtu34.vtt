00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.731
Let's have another look at an inequality involving an absolute value sign. We

00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:07.403
have the absolute value of x is less than 5. Now, I'd like you to get rid of the

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:11.231
absolute value signs around x, in a mathematically correct way, of course, and

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:15.256
write the solution as a chained compound inequality. Remember, that's a compound

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:18.847
inequality where we get rid of the and sign, and just write everything as one

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:20.637
connected mathematical statement.
