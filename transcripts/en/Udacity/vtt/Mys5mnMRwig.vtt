00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.091
Now that we've come up with this new equality. The absolute value of x minus 4

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.095
is greater than or equal to 4. How should we show that on a number line? I've

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:11.877
already selected three points for you where we may or may not need a kind of

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:16.198
parenthesis or bracket. Those points are negative 1, 4, and 9. And, of course,

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:20.290
those were all important when we were dealing with the absolute value of x minus

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.173
4 is less than or equal to 5. So, for each of these three points, please select

00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:28.152
which symbol belongs on the number line at that point. You'll notice I've also

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:32.545
drawn four boxes down here for you. One for the area of the number line to the

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:37.030
left of negative 1. One for the area between negative 1 and 4. One for the area

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.320
between 4 and 9 and one for the area for the right of 9. I'd like you to check

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.165
off which of these areas of the number line should be shaded in.
