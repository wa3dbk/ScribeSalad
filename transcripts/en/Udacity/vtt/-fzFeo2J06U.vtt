00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.822
When we were working with equations for
Grant this last time, what we were really

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:09.355
doing was taking one expression, 87w+72n,
and subtracting from it another

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:13.922
expression, 3w+ And we worked with
parentheses in a kind of new way. So,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:18.794
let's take a second, and talk a bit more
explicitly about how to add and subtract

00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:23.698
polynomials. Let's start out by comparing
what the difference is between subtracting

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.171
polynomials and adding polynomials. So,
this first expression is what dealt with

00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:32.281
in the last quiz. And we saw that because
there's a minus sign in front of a

00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:36.682
quantity with parentheses around it, we
need to change the sign of the operator

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:41.254
that's in front of the 12n here. That's
inside the parentheses. So, here's what we

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:45.589
ended up with. We said that we needed to
subtract both the 3w and the 12n, so both

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:50.017
of them have minus signs in front of them
now. What if instead, though, we decided

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:53.696
to add them? So, we want to add this
entire quantity that's inside the

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:58.099
parentheses. So, here's a little quiz.
What terms would you put in this green box

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:02.699
right here to correctly complete this
expression over here? The key here is that

00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:07.043
I want you to get rid of these parentheses
that are around the 3w+12n, and show me

00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:11.253
how doing that changes the expression.
I've already put a plus sign right here

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:15.445
for you. So, that means that if you want
the first term in the box to be negative,

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.797
then I'd like you to put a negative sign
in front of it.
