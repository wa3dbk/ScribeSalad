Congratulations on completing inferential statistics. We really hope you've

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.140
enjoyed this course. You now have the skills you

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.620
need to analyze your very own dataset and make

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.640
accurate predictions. Now you're ready to move on to your

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.210
final project, where you'll perform your own statistical analysis

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.170
on a dataset. With your selected data set, you'll

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.250
investigate a hypothesis of your choice, and present your

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.740
findings in a short report. This report will include visualizations,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.490
descriptive statistics, test results, and an interpretation of

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.400
what you've found. If you're looking for what

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.210
course to go to next, maybe try out

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.750
our introduction to data science class or introduction

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630
to computer science if you want to expand

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.090
your programming knowledge. Both of these classes are

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.310
linked in the instructor's notes box. Either way,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.970
we really look forward to seeing you again soon.
