00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What have you learned? Well, to flip a coin n times one for k small or equal to n.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We ask the probability--what are the chance it comes up heads k times.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For any coin, with the probability of heads equals to all caps P,.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we now get the following formula:  n!/(n-k)!&lt;i&gt;k!.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
These are the total number of outcomes that have this property.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then this one has the following probability:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000
P to the k, this was the (0.8)⁹ before times (1-p) to the n-k,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which is the remaining 3 over here in this example.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, this formula is the probability of what's call the binomial distribution

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and really was this is the accumulated outcome of many identical coin flips,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and it leads us beautifully to our next lesson

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
when we talk about very large experiments and the normal distribution.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What you should have learned and understand now is you can take very large experiments

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
with large numbers of coin flips and compute the probability that heads comes a certain number

00:01:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of times using the formula that you should now fully and wholly understand.
