00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.517
To find the roots we need to replace y with 0 and then we just isolate x. After

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:08.919
a slight bit of arranging we've x squared equals negative 4. We can already

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.126
recognize at this point that is going to need to be an imaginary number.

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:17.797
Otherwise when we squared we wouldn't end up with negative. When we take the

00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:22.311
square root of both sides here, we need to make sure that 1 of the sides has a

00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:27.228
plus or minus before the radical sign. And simplifying the right side, gives us

00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:29.304
that x is equal to plus or minus 2i.
