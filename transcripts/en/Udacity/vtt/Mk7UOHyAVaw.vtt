00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.950
This possibility of Turing
machines looping forever

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.150
leads us to define the notion
of a language recognizing.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.100
We say that a Turing machine
recognizes a language if and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.490
only if it accepts every
string in the language and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.900
does not accept any string
not in the language.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.600
Thus we can say that the turning
machine from the quiz

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.410
does indeed recognize the language
consisting of strings that contain a 1.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.610
It accepts those containing a 1.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.990
And it doesn't accept the others.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.130
Instead, it loops on them.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.210
Contrast this definition
with what it takes for

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.600
a Turing machine to decide a language.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.020
Then, it must not only accept
every string in the language but

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.590
it has to reject every
string not in the language.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.110
It can't loop like this Turing machine.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.990
If we wanted to build a decider for
this language,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.740
we would need to modify
the Turing machine so

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.290
that it detects the end of the string
and moves into the reject state like so.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.350
At this point, it also makes sense to
define the language of the machine.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.650
Which is just the language
that the machine recognizes.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.250
After all, every machine recognizes some
language even if it's the empty one.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.460
Formally, we define L(M) to be
the set of strings that m accepts.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.150
That's the language of the machine M.
