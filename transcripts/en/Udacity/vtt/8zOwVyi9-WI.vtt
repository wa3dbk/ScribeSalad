00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.570
Going back to our Tsunami app code,
let's observe how the string builder is

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.060
being used to build up
the JSON string response.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.959
So I'm going to go take a look
at the readFromStream method.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.701
In the readFromStream method,
we have an input stream, and

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:14.210
we want to return a string containing
the contents of that stream.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.560
So we create a new string builder and
we can start appending to it

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.440
all the lines of text available
in our buffered reader.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.020
First, we set up our builder and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.520
our reader, then we'll ask the buffered
reader for a line of text.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.030
While the line isn't null, we'll append
that line to the string buffer and

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.970
read another line.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.115
Eventually the buffered reader will run
out of lines and we'll use the toString

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:36.405
method to get and return the final
output from the string builder.

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:39.245
So as you can see, using the string
builder to gradually build up

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:42.715
the response string, is more efficient
than continually creating a new string

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:46.035
object each time we have more
content to add to the response text.
