00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.280
So our first rule for

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.010
our normalized table, will be that every
row has the same number of columns.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.100
A column can be empty or zero, but we
can't have two columns in some rows and

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.910
three columns in another row.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.129
That just doesn't make sense
in a relational database.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.140
In fact, that's pretty much
the same thing that's going on,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.940
when we had the food one,
food two, and food three columns.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.180
If you have two values
with the same meaning for

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.582
a given key, they're going to need to
end up in separate rows, like this.

00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:34.380
Second rule, some one or
more columns of the table are the key,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.360
which identify what thing
each row is telling us about,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.210
like an animal, a species,
a bank account number, a website user.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.250
In a simple table,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.640
like majors, it may be that all of
the columns are part of the key.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.390
Any other columns in the table
besides the key have to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.890
describe something about the key.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.050
In any row, the key provides the topic
of the sentence that the rest of

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.290
the row says something about.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.140
Rule 3, in a normalized table,
the non-key columns describe the key.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.560
They don't describe
other non-key columns.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.780
So if you had a table of items and
how many there are, and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.590
what location their in and
the street address of that location.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.220
To normalize that you don't split
out the mapping from location to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.060
address from the rest of the table,
like so.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.480
That way you can talk about a location
without talking about a particular item.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.760
It's not as if the street address is
specific to a particular item after all.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.990
Lastly, in a normalized table,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.270
the rows don't imply relationships among
the data that don't actually exist.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.420
This is something to watch out for,
especially when you have multiple rows

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.460
about the same entity and multiple
facts you want to record about it.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.530
Suppose that you have some information
about some people's work skills,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.450
including the languages that they know.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.110
Here Annabel knows Databases and

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.500
Linux and Data Science, and
English, and French and Arabic.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.340
And Leon knows Data Science and
Windows, and English and Kurdish.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.940
But Databases don't have anything
particularly to do with English,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.919
not Linux with French.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.980
But these rows make
it look like they do.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.470
They make it look like Annabel's Linux
skill has something to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.260
do with her French language ability,
and that's almost certainly wrong.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.770
So the mapping from people to
their technology skills, and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.240
the mapping of people to the languages
they know belong in separate tables.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.090
So there are four rules for
normalizing tables.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.350
There's a lot more to learn
about this topic, though.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.910
I've put some links in the instructor
notes, that you might want to read.
