00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.484
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We should shade region 2. I can use the test point 0,0 and plug in these

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:11.565
values to check. If I plug 0 in for y, and 0 in for x, I get 0 is greater than

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:17.156
or equal to 3. But wait, this isn't true. I know zero is actually less than 3.

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:21.876
Because this point doesn't satisfy our inequality and we wind up with a

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:27.018
statement that's not true, we don't want any of this region. We only want the

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:32.241
other region. Any points on this side of the line or on the line would work. So,

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.523
here's the final graph of our linear inequality.
