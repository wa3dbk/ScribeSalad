00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.240
&gt;&gt; That's good, David. Note that David started on the top left corner, this is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.170
a random selection. He could have started at any other corner, for example,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.050
this one or that one. And found the same answer and that is because we have

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.020
simplified these constraints. But now that we know that this line is a fold,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.720
by the definition of fold, we know that two surfaces must be meeting at this

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.190
line. It follows then, that this must be a surface and this must be a surface.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.280
Similarly, because we know this is a fold and by definition of a fold,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
two surfaces must be meeting here. Follows this is a surface,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.000
this is a surface and so on. And now we have identified that this one surface,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.160
this is another surface, this is a third surface. In this way, the visual system

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.090
used knows the different kinds of junctions in the world of triangular objects,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.700
and it constrains at each of these junctions to figure out which of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.360
these lines made surfaces. Instead of thinking of this as one single surface,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.120
the visual system identified this as being composed of three different surfaces.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.730
And now we can recognize that this might be a cube.
