00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.993
This equation tells us that 2 is a number that is 1 greater than n. So that

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:10.111
means that n is a number that is 1 less than 2, so n must be equal to 1. We can

00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:15.797
check this by plugging 1 back into our equation, or using substitution. If we do

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.335
that, we get 1 plus 1 equals 2. Since 1 plus 1 does equal 2, that checks out.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.265
And our answer for n must be correct.
