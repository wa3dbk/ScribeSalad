00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.880
The answer is that that
algorithm is simply too slow.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.119
It would have to consider all n
choose m possible bases, which,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.390
for problems of any reasonable size,
is impractical.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.110
All of the other suggested
problems really aren't problems.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.920
Every feasible solution is
considered because we consider

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.870
every possible basis.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.580
It's fine to consider
just basic solutions,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.260
as argued in the fundamental
theorem of linear programming.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.470
Indeed, the matrix B that we
generate here might be singular, but

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.170
we can just ignore that combination
as the algorithm does here.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.280
And indeed, x might be degenerate,
but this is okay,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.000
it would just show up in
more than one iteration.
