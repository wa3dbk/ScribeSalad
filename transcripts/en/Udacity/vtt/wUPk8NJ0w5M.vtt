00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.812
Just as we can change the color of an object using a texture, we can also

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:07.568
change its transparency. Here's a simple scene with a leaf added to it by

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:11.019
putting a leaf texture on a square. Here's the same scene with the square

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.954
selected, so you can see the underlying geometry. The two key things I needed

00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:18.178
to do was mark the square as transparent, and to make a texture with an alpha

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:22.726
channel. Recall that a transparent object needs to be given a transparent

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:26.985
material. This ensures that it'll be rendered after all opaque objects, and

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:30.040
that blending is turned on so that any transparent pixels will blend properly

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.012
with the objects behind. In this case most of the pixels are either opaque or

00:00:35.012 --> 00:00:39.146
fully transparent, but the idea is the same. By turning on blending, the leaf's

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:43.756
RGB values are properly blended using its alpha values. Actually making the

00:00:43.756 --> 00:00:47.234
texture with an alpha channel, I leave to you. Packages such as GIMP,

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:51.516
Paint.net, or Photoshop can create an alpha channel for an image. You'll

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:55.420
typically want to use the PNG format to store the results, since PNG supports

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.792
alpha. Here's an example of an object with its alpha texture. White areas are

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:03.248
where the plant is, black is transparent, and gray alphas mean the pixels are

00:01:03.248 --> 00:01:05.930
partially covered by some leaf.
