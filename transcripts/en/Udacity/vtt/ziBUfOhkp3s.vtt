00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now you, via the interpreter, are going to write the first part of our parser.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Our parser is just going to build up this big variable chart.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We've already seen how to seed it with an initial value for chart state 0

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and also how to see if a string is accepted by a grammar--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
it's in the language of the grammar--by checking chart t if there are t tokens

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to see if it has the final state.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's say we're deep in the middle of this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We're currently looking at chart sub i, and we see that x goes to ab dot cd from j.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We're going to write the following code in our parser.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're going to call a special function called "closure"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and pass it the grammar, just as we described before.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I, which is going to be a number, that's the chart state we're looking at.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
X, that's going to be a single nonterminal.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Ab, that's going to be this list here--could be empty, could have many things.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And cd, that's this list here--could be empty, could have many thing.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This closure function is going to return all the new parsing states

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that we want to add to chart position i.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's going to return a list of next states.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
For each one of those, we're going to add it to the chart.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We've already written addtochart together,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and we're going to figure out if there were any changes over all of the things you returned.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
For example, let's say you returned three things but two of them were already in the chart.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Since at least one of those was a change, then we want any changes to be true.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This blue code here, this is locked is stone. I'm definitely going to use this.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But you can write any definition for closure that you like

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
as long as it correctly implements how the closure is supposed to work.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Go forth.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is relatively tricky, and here is my hint.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If you're stuck, do a list comprehension over the grammar rules.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Remember that you're trying to return states,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and every state is pretty much like a grammar rule

00:01:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but with the addition of that red dot somewhere in the middle.
