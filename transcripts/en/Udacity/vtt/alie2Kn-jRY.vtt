00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.360
The core Hadoop project consists of a way to store

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.990
data, known as the Hadoop distributed file system, or HDFS. And

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.670
a way to process data with MapReduce. The key concept is

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.790
that we split the data up and store it across the

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.820
collection of machines known as a cluster. Then when we want

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.680
to process the data, we process it where it's actually stored.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.400
Rather than retrieving the data from a central server, the data's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.840
already on the cluster, so we can process it in place.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.800
You can add more machines to the cluster

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.090
as the amount of data you're storing grows.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.659
And, indeed, many people start with just a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.510
few machines, and add more as they're needed.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.400
The machines in your cluster don't need to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.580
be anything particularly high end. Although most clusters

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.385
are built using rack-mounted servers, they are typically

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:46.350
mid-range servers, rather than top of the range equipment.
