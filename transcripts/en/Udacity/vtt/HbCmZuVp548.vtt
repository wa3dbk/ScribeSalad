00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.760
All right, why don't we walk through the solution?

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.880
Here we define our olympic_medal_counts_df data frame as we have in

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.150
the past couple of exercises.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.160
Then we simply say avg_medal_count is equal to olympic_medal_counts_df and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.880
we pick out only the gold, silver and bronze columns and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.239
then we use the data frames apply method and provide us the argument numpy.mean
