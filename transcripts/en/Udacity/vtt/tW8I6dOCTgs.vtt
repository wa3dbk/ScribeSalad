00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.416
Now that we have four possible areas for the Fun Room, I'd like you to consider

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:09.039
which of these actually make sense in the context of the situation we're talking

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.749
about. You can always reference the parent function up here, a of x equals 4x

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:18.640
squared plus 6x, to remind yourself of what the independent variable stands for

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.154
in this situation and with the dependent variable is. So, consider both the

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:27.430
input and the output in each of these four cases. And please check off which

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.017
choices that you think do not make sense in the context of Athena's story.
