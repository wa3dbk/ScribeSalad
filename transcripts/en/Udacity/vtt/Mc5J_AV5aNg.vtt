The goal of modules is to support modular design. That shouldn't be too

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:07.448
surprising, that's where the name modules comes from. And what that means is

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:11.034
that if we have a large system, we can break it down into pieces. And the

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:14.574
important thing about how we break it down into pieces is that in order to

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:18.468
understand the whole system, we don't need to understand all the details of all

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:23.395
the pieces at once. We can understand each piece by itself. So to understand the

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:27.425
red piece we only need to understand the red piece, we don't need to know the

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:31.480
details of the blue and the green piece. The only thing we need to understand

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.140
about the green piece is the interface between the red piece and the green

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.464
piece. Similarly if we're working on the green piece. We don't need to

00:00:38.464 --> 00:00:41.634
understand all the details of the red piece and the blue piece. We just need to

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:43.943
understand the interfaces between the pieces.
