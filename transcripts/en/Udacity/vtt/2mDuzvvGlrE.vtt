00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.689
Grant has convinced Athena to help him out with some of the the Gleaming

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.100
Glasses business stuff. He's given her yet another new equation, that he says

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.748
is going to describe the profit the company will make, if he invests x

00:00:10.748 --> 00:00:17.780
thousands of dollars in advertising. So we have P of x equals x cubed minus 20

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.660
x squared plus 118 x minus 164. Grant wants to figure out how much money he

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.604
needs to spend on advertising to make some sort of profit, but he also wants to

00:00:26.604 --> 00:00:29.456
avoid spending too much money, so much that it would drain all of his profit

00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:35.798
away. In other words, Athena needs to figure out, for what values of x does

00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:41.305
this equation P of x equals 0. In other words, Athena is looking for routes of

00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:45.402
this function. We're not quite ready to help her answer this question yet

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:50.720
though. Let's backtrack for a second. First off, can you tell me what the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.380
minimum number of real zeros this function has to have is? Think critically

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.863
about what kind of polynomial this is.
