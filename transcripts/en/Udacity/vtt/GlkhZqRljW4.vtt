00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.040
Six x plus 36, and five x plus ten, are our new numerators. Great work if you

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.732
found those two. We know we're really just distributing the six to the x and the

00:00:10.732 --> 00:00:16.810
six. So six times x is six-x. And six times six is 36. For this new numerator,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.281
we're distributing the five times x, which is five-x. And 5 times 2 which is 10.

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:25.929
So, 5x plus 10 is our new numerator.
