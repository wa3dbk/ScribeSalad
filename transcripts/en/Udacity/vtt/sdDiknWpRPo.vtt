As we saw in the quiz before this one, if we are 100% positive that f inverse

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:11.150
is the inverse of f. Then that also means that f is the inverse of f inverse.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.119
This may just seem like symantics but that also means that f and f inverse are

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.304
inverses of one another. In other words, if we start with a function f, and we

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:25.305
take it's inverse we end up with f inverse. Then if we take the inverse of f

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:29.730
inverse we just end up with f. This explains why in the last two quizzes we

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.129
did, we circle back to end up with the equations we started out with.
