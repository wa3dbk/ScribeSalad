00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.210
All right, so we have a problem.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.100
The brightest constraint equation
gives us more unknowns than equations.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.510
More directions to move
than we have pixels.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.614
How are we going to recover the motion?

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:15.825
Obviously, we need
some extra constraints.

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:17.665
We need some additional constraints.

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.605
So, we'll talk about sort of
a global approach now, and

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:22.605
the next time we'll talk about
a more local approach that,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.995
that's actually used and, in fact,
some of you may even implement.

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:30.645
Some time long, long ago in
a galaxy nearby Berthold Horn and

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:34.645
Brad Schunk did some work on what
was called smooth optical flows.

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:36.220
And basically they said,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.690
let's try to come up with an optical
flow that minimizes some error.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.570
Okay?

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.290
So the first part of the error is
how much do we violate the optic,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.600
the brightness constancy
constraint equation, right?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.340
Basically, that middle term right there,
that's supposed to be zero.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.240
Right?
Ixu plus Iyv plus I sub t is equal

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.520
to zero.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.410
So, violations of that
means that it's not zero.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.420
Sometimes it's positive
sometimes negative.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.750
I square it, and
I sum it up over the whole image.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.040
That would be how bad my flow is with
respect to the constraint equation.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.560
All right?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.090
But we know we can solve that exactly
because we have more unknowns

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.000
than constraints, so If that's our only
constraint, we're, we're not done.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.530
But we're going to call
this the constraint error.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.930
By the way, I kept partially originally
I'd stolen, then I did on my own, I kept

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.600
the integral signs instead of summations
because back when this work was done

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.230
we'd like to think about images as
actually continual, continual functions.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.470
Of course,
if you were to implement this,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.220
you'd actually have to do summations.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.110
I'll also tell you the fact that
summations are not integrals matters and

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.970
if you take a look at some of the work
that was done in shape from shading,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.240
doing it as an integral
was actually hard.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.650
Doing it in summations was,
in some sense, a little bit easier.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.350
But for here,
the difference doesn't matter, so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.920
I just wrote it as being
summed up over the image.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.830
So here we have our optic
flow constraint term.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.170
Now we need another term.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.580
Well, it says smooth optical flow,
here's the idea.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.740
Remember when we did stereo?

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.520
The, the state of the art
solution that I showed you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.240
with that beautiful recovery?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.800
Used a bunch of terms,
some that had to do with the data, but

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.760
it also had to do with the smoothness
of the disparity field?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.380
That was the idea that surfaces don't
change a lot, all over the place.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.830
But they tend to have a particular
depth or very smoothly.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.020
The same could be said of motion,
that is, so if I've got something moving

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.460
around, the motion vectors from one
point to the next change slowly.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.119
So let me come up with a penalty
term that says I really don't like

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.240
velocity fields where the velocity
changes quickly from one

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.690
location to the neighboring location.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.870
So that's shown here.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.800
These ux, ui,
that's the derivative of u.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.400
Remember, u is the x component
of the motion field.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.530
The derivative in the x direction
squared, because it'd be positive,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.730
negative, derivative in the y
direction squared, same thing as here,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.150
which is v sub x, v sub y,
the change of v as you move in x,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.920
the change in v as you move in y.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.140
Again, everything is squared.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.820
So the idea is, we would like
this thing to be, like, zero, or

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.470
as little as possible.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.870
By the way, what would it mean for
this to be zero?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.460
Well, for this to be zero,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.300
that would mean that all
the u's were constant, right?

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.930
They were all the same value, so
the derivatives would be zero.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.070
And all the v's would be constant.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.870
So if all my pixels were
moving with the same uv,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.160
the whole image was moving the same
direction, this value would be zero.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.020
Any other u's and v's will cause
this term to have some value,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.080
and we want to try to
minimize this thing.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.850
So now, we have these two terms.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.080
We have the constraint
equation error term and

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.260
we have the smoothness error term called
e sub c, e sub s and what we want to do

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.690
is we want to find the uv at every pixel
and there's going to be a different

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.480
uv at every pixel that minimizes
this total error which is just

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.620
the smoothness term plus some waiting
factor times the constraint term.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.310
And the waiting factor is sort of,
how much you believe your data.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.270
So, the bigger the waiting factor is
the more important the satisfying

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.460
the brightness constancy constraint is,
the smaller the waiting factor, the more

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.390
the smoothness term dominates and what
value it should have is a function of

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.870
sort of how much noise there is and how
smooth you believe the entire thing is.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.750
So, this was part of a, a general
approach, variational approach where

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.660
you're going to solve for uv as a
function of xy that is, you're going to

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.220
find the optic flow u and v for every
pixel that tries to minimize this error.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.740
It's somewhat painful to try
to implement systems that can

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.770
solve for that.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.230
Not impossible.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.480
But the idea is that you have a global
constraint, the smoothness constraint,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.700
to help solve your problem.
