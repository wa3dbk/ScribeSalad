00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.680
In the documentation for Async Task, we can

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.440
scroll down to the section that talks about

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.380
protected methods. Here we see that different methods

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.540
are called on the UI thread versus on the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.870
background thread. It also contains information on what

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.450
order these methods are called in. Relative to the

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.020
doInBackground method. For example, onPreExecute gets called on

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.660
the UI thread before doInBackground. So with that information

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.470
now, we can populate the answers to our quiz. As

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.720
we mentioned before, onPreExecute happens on the main thread. And

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.130
here you can do any setup work. Then doInBackground happens

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.390
on the background thread. While this is running, you can actually

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.090
call publishProgress as many times as you want, so that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.450
you can pass information to the UI. So that it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.380
can update an then tell the user that a certain

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.640
percentage of the work is done. Each time this is called,.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.690
It triggers onProgressUpdate with some information. Then,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.060
you can show a loading indicator in

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.700
your UI that says something's 10% done, 50% done, 100% done. And all this

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.000
happens on the main thread. And then, once all of this is complete in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450
the background thread, then it calls onPostExecute

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.980
with the results on the main thread.
