00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.610
So, to emphasize good programming style, here's a quiz. Why do we prefer version

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.830
A, where we used the named arguments, over version B, where we didn't? And these

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.850
two produce exactly the same thing. We can use format string with just using

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.782
squiggles with no names. It's just going to use the arguments passed in, in

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:20.032
order. The choices are, longer is better, and A is longer. If we make a mistake

00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:24.000
and use the wrong parameter name by using named parameters like we did in A, we

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.162
would get an error. For example, if we used value here instead of price, these

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:32.020
wouldn't match up and this would lead to a parameter error. With version B,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.250
there's no names so there's nothing to match, so there wouldn't be any error.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.946
For the third choice, the names make it easier for others to read and understand

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:42.443
the code. Check all the good reasons why we would prefer A over B.
