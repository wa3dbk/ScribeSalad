00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.880
Obviously if there are multiple good answers in here, don't

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.780
cache isn't the solution and given that this is the content

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.650
of our lecture, we're going to continue with our caching. So, let's

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.320
look at these other three. Improve the cache to automatically expire

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.540
after some time. I'm not going to count this as correct. Although

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.760
it is possible. And actually many caches, and the, the, the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.070
main cache we'll be talking about shortly, has this ability. But

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.130
that doesn't solve our problem here, because if things automatically disappear

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.940
out of the cache after some amount of time, there's no

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.310
guarantee that that's going to coincide with our submission time. So

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.140
let's look at the other answer, after submitting, clear the cache.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.980
Yes. This will work. This basically restores the cache to the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.700
state that it was in before we did a request. So

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.450
you submit some art. We store it in the database, and

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.370
then we blank the cache, and then the next page load

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.360
clears the cache. Another answer after submitting, update the cache. This also

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.040
works, but it makes things more complicated. So,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.660
in other words, after submitting a piece of art,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.560
we update the database, and we immediately update

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.190
the cache at the same time so that the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.450
next page load of the front page has

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.730
an updated version of the art. This would work,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.320
but it's, it's more complex, so let's start with

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.380
the first solution after we submit clear the cache.
