00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.019
Let's see if we understood
what virtual memory is about.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.310
Let's say we have a computer
with 16 active applications.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.400
Each with a 32-bit address space
meaning, that the application

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.140
generates 32-bit addresses, so
it sees 4 GB of memory potentially.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.750
The question for

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.630
you is, what does the system actually
have as far as memory is concerned?

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.217
Two 2 GB memory modules,
four 4 GB memory modules,

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:35.125
eight 8GB memory modules,
one 16 GB memory module.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:39.869
So like all the answers
here that are possible.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:46.430
That is, all of the answers that might
work with this, should be checked.
