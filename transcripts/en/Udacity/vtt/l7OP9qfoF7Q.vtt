00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.040
So all of our data is on Hoodu, and, we

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.710
use Pig to reduce it. But there are many similar tools

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.430
like Hive that are used at other companies, but it's really

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.120
important to be able to take all the data that, that's

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.450
far too large to fit on any computer, and be able

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.050
to aggregate it down or reduce it down. To a point

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.560
where it's small enough that you can look at, look at

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.250
it. Like, on a single machine. Or make a sort of,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.160
reduced plot of it. So being able to handle the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.400
data and pull the data from different sources is very useful.
