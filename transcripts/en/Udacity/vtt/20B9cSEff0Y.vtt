Unfortunately, the baby monkeys did not develop well socially. In fact, they

00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.308
were aggressive, anti-social, and if they did become parents themselves, they

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:13.482
were abusive to their offspring. These monkeys did not have any role models to

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:17.526
teach them how to parent or how to interact with other monkeys.

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:20.108
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right. And that's why Harlow's research was criticized so much by

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:21.205
ethical groups.

00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:24.439
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Although it was completely legal in the time before the Animal Welfare Act told

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.085
us we had to treat animals ethically.

00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:32.438
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; However, it does demonstrate an important part about development. It reinforces

00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:35.427
the idea that we are social creatures and we need to have interactions for

00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:37.520
aappropriate development.
