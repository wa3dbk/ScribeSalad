00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
So, by now, we know two types of RAM machine.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.399
The first one here on the left is the one that we introduced in the first unit

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.449
and it does not allow to use the if-better function.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.950
So, this is something that is although as we discussed

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.720
it has some differences to your standard computer.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.780
It is more or less close to your  normal computer.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.820
And here on the right side, we have the RAM with the if-better function

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.269
and this of course is a much more powerful machine

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.420
so as you can see it is buzzing with computational power here

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.520
and this is totally unlike your standard computer because it has this guessing function about n

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.100
and of course, if somebody asked us to build this sort of RAM machine

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.680
at least I would turn them down immediately because it's not clear at all

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.740
how we should write such a function.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.210
It seems far too powerful and at least to me frankly also a bit mysterious.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.840
So, that's also basically the difference between the two machines

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.620
because here on the standard RAM, it's very clear what each of the functions that it has does.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.330
Actually, if you know what the machine is currently doing then you can always predict

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.569
what it will do next because for every instruction it's very clear what it does

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:13.700
given certain variables or inputs and not so with the RAM that uses if-better function above.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.890
Actually, most of the time unless this function is use, it's still clear what happens next

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.330
but every time this function here is called, we don't really know what's going to happen next.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.610
It seems as if only this function here kind of knows.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.920
Or if you put it in another way, if you go through an algorithm that is written on a standard RAM

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.070
then you can basically go through it step by step by step by hand

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.180
and say how its going to behave.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.830
For this RAM over here, you could also go through it step, by step, by step

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.979
but once you encounter this if-better function here, you could not really say what its going to do next.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.330
You would have to try different cases and so in order to better distinguish those two models,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.630
there is a special terminology in theoretical computer science

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.800
called determinism and non-determinism.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.280
And this standard RAM machine because we always know what's going to happen next

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.448
is called deterministic and surprise this one over here is called non-deterministic.

00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:13.230
Now, it's very important that you familiarize yourself with those two terms

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.980
because we're going to use them a lot in this course,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.770
and just to make you think about them a little  bit more, I would like to do a little quiz with you.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.060
So, what I would like you to think about is,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.820
if you're using the if-better function in a program and we run the same program code multiple times,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.710
can we get different solutions if we're running it on the same input

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.680
or will we always get the same solution?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.140
So if you think that non-determinism can produce different solutions on the same input

00:02:40.140 --> 99:59:59.000
using the same code then please check yes, otherwise, check no.
