00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] I hope you're getting a sense that lists are very powerful.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That by using mutation, by having lists that could contain other lists

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or any other kind of data we want,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we can build very complex data structures, and we can do lots of interesting things.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm going to introduce 1 more list operation,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which will allow us to add a new element at the end of the list.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We've seen that we can use lists to store complex data,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that elements of the list can be any type we want including other lists,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we've seen that we can use mutation to change the value of a list,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and that mutation is visible through any reference to the same list object.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now I'm going to introduce some other list operations.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The first one is append, and append is like a procedure but it's a method,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so we use it similar to the way we use to find on strings.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We'll have a list first, then a dot followed by append,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and what we pass in is the element we want to append to the list.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Append will add a new element to the end of a list,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the important thing about append is that it's mutating

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the list that its invoked on.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's not creating a new list; it's mutating the old list.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
As an example of the use of append let's assume that instead of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
replacing curly in the 3 stooges, we want to end up with 4 stooges.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We'll add Shemp and add the other 3 as they are.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So what we want to do is to append Shemp at the end of the list we have.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We would do that by invoking append on the stooges,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
passing in the string Shemp as the input.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Here's what happens after the first assignment,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the name stooges refers to the list containing the 3 elements,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Moe, Larry, and Curly.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
When we invoke append it modifies that object,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
adding a new element to it.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
After the append, the list that stooges refers to now has 4 elements.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We have not created a new list.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Note that there's no assignment from the result of append.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
What we've done is modify the value that stooges refers to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
by adding a new element to it.
