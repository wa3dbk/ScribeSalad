00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.430
Now we follow the idea of associativety to the extreme

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.870
and let any cache block be put anywhere in the

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.030
cache. Returning to our example, if this was a direct

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.620
map cache, where every block has only one place to go.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.790
And this was a set associative cache, where there was

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.120
a small set of places that a block can go. Then

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.220
this is a fully associative cache where all cache blocks

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.170
are treated alike and can be put anywhere in the cache.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.310
Looking at a more general notation, then we see

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.040
that full associativity means we don't interpret any of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.620
the address as index anymore. It's all tag. This

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.710
means that when we ask if a particular address is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.020
stored in the cache. The hardware has to check

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.480
tags for every cache entry. Or at least, do

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.420
it sequentially really, really fast. This fact, generally limits

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.170
fully associative caches to sizes between 64 and 256 entries
