00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.180
Finally, we can start writing the page.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.710
But before we do, we need some kind of convention for

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.750
how we're going to name all of the columns in our grid, so

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.020
we can easily remember them later when we want to use them.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.910
First off, we need a name for this entire row.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.340
And for that, I think it makes sense to just call it a row.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.890
No need to make things complicated.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.200
Now we need names for all of the columns here.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.520
Or for elements of different column widths.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.510
First one we'll do, well, col-1.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.030
Why not?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.480
It's one column wide, so we'll just call it col-1.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.230
If we want element to be two columns wide, we'll call it col-2.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.229
To indicate that it's two columns wide.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.120
Same thing for col-3, that is three columns wide.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.430
And so on until we get to col-12, which is the full width of the row.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.250
This makes our lives pretty easy.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.720
Let's imagine we wanted something to be a quarter of the full width wide.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.510
A quarter of 12 is three, so we simply need to give that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.070
element a class of column three to make sure it's a quarter of this entire row.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.240
Let's go ahead and set this up in our CSS file.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.610
First, we'll set up some borders so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.480
we can easily see where our elements are on the screen.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.710
And then let's set up some box sizing.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.120
Then we'll define our row.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.740
Remember, each row should take up the entire width of the screen.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.480
So we'll set it to width 100%.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.120
After row, we'll set up the width of all of our columns.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.870
You'll see col-1, col-2,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.790
col-3, just like we decided to do before.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.370
And each width is set to a percentage of the page.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.310
Col-1 is one twelfth of the page.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.680
Col-2 is two twelfths of the page.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.430
Col-3 is three twelfths of the page, and so on.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.540
Now that we've got our CSS set, let's get a sample page to see if this works.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.970
In the instructor notes, you'll find the HTML that you see right here.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.170
And notice that we've gotten outer class of row, and then, two inner columns.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.690
Col-2 and col-10.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.420
So together, they should fill up the entire row.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.450
Then we have col-3 and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.210
col-9, 3 plus 9 is 12 so these two columns should also fill up this row.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.302
Let's see if it works.

00:01:48.302 --> 00:01:52.780
Opening test.html in the browser and we see this.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.700
Hm.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.110
Something doesn't look right.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660
So we can see column 2 and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.380
column 10, but it looks like they're stacked on top of each other.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.140
They're not lining up next to each other.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.750
Same thing for 3 and 9.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.750
Three 4's.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.490
3, 6, 3. Each one of these should just fill up one row.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.758
But instead, the columns are stacked on top of each other.

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:11.540
It looks like we've got a problem here.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.750
What style should we add to the row class of CSS to fix the way

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.520
the columns are behaving?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.690
Should we add display block?

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.420
Should we add display flex and flex wrap, wrap, or just display float?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.570
The easiest way to figure this out is to open up dev tools and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.380
add these CSS styles to the row class
