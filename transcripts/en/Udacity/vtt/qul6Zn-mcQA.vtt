00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.500
There are many different
distributions of Linux out there for

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.800
you to choose from.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.370
So how do you make the right choice?

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.820
First, you need to understand
exactly what a distribution is and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.450
the ways in which they can
differ from one another.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.000
Because Linux is free as in speech,
people are free to make a variety of

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.490
choices when they decide to
create their own distribution.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.580
They can choose what
software to include,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.660
how that software should be updated, how
the community makes contributions, and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.420
even how that particular distribution
can be shared with others.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.310
For example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is
a popular distribution for enterprises.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.510
This particular distribution
is not free as in beer.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.760
Companies have to pay a licensing fee.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.140
In return for that payment, they have
the right to use the software and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.380
receive support from Red Hat.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.300
Ubuntu is another popular distribution
that itself has various versions.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.200
Some tailored towards servers, others
for desktops, and even mobile phones.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.050
Ubuntu receives consistent
updates to it's software,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.860
which is how it differs from
it's parent distribution Debian.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.165
Debian is known for
it's stability and reliability.

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:09.610
Many Debian servers have been up and

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.340
running for
years without requiring a reboot.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.780
For this reason its software
updates cycle is very slow

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.740
when compared to others.
