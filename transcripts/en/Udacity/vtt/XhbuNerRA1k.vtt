00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.599
The other Python feature I want to introduce now is default parameters. Default

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:09.088
parameters allow us to have parameters that don't necessarily need to be passed

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:12.963
in. This is very handy. So, here's an example to illustrate the value of default

00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:17.224
parameters. Remember that we defined the dish class and it's initializer takes

00:00:17.224 --> 00:00:20.550
three parameters in addition to the self object. A name, a price and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.465
description. But there's some dishes that are so famous that they don't need a

00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:27.666
description. Either that or they defy description. So, suppose that applies to

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:31.535
our Bodacious Burger. We could pass in None or some empty string or some other

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.856
value, but really, we don't want to pass in anything. We don't want to have a

00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:39.010
description. That's okay if we have just one parameter that we don't care about.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.287
But suppose we have lots of them. Then, we might end up needing to do something

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:46.430
like this. We've got 1, 2, 3, 4 parameters we don't care about, we've got to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.144
remember to have those. And then, we've got one that we do care about, say that

00:00:50.144 --> 00:00:53.640
is the number of side dishes that comes with the Bodacious Burger. And we want

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.810
that to have a value 3. And then, we've got to remember another one that we

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.410
don't care about. This gets to be pretty unwieldy, the way we're going to avoid

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.770
this is to give default values for the parameters. And then, we only have to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.864
pass in the ones that are different from the default values. The way to do this

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:10.420
is quite simple. For each parameter that we want to have a default value, like

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.105
the description parameter, we just add an assignment giving it the value that we

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:17.830
want it to have. So, the description parameter will have a default value None.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.900
If we don't pass in a description, it will have the value None. If we pass it

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.575
in, it will have the value that we pass it. Then, we can use a note like this,

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:29.718
creating new instances of the Dish class. Only passing in parameters whose value

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:33.670
differs from the default value. We always have to pass in the name and price

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.072
because they have no default value, and those are the first two in both calls

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:40.403
here. But otherwise, we don't have to pass in anything else unless we want a

00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:43.636
value different from the default value, like we do here with the Broccoli

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:47.005
Burger, which is vegetarian, the default value is False. For the Bodacious

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.580
Burger, we didn't pass in any value for vegetarian, that means it will have the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.989
default value which is False. And it's highly non-recommended for vegetarians.
