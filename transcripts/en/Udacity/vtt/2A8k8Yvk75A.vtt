00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.544
This is pretty tricky, so let's have a quiz to see that you understand it. So

00:00:03.544 --> 00:00:07.384
the question is, what's the difference between sobj1, which is the result of

00:00:07.384 --> 00:00:11.344
calling super passing and Discerning Bear with a Discerning Bear instance and

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:15.184
sobj2, which is the result of calling super passing and Grizzly Bear with the

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:19.150
Discerning Bear instance. And you should be able to answer this, by giving a

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.566
single line of code, that behaves differently, depending on whether the variable

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.414
sobj references sobj1 or sobj2.
