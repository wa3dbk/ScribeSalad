00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
So while looking at the data, we very quickly discovered that the data

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.790
showed quite a lot of variance, which was very likely to

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.150
impact the accuracy of any regression estimator we might want to build.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.889
To see why this is, consider the opposite end of the spectrum.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.097
The data shows no variance.

00:00:17.097 --> 00:00:20.506
In this case, if the values of your features of the same,

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:25.970
the measured response variable, in this case, arrival time is always the same.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.920
That is you have a static functional mapping.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.323
And the learning problem amounts to learning aesthetic functional mapping.

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.502
As you introduce variance into this,

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:38.452
it slowly becomes more difficult to predict the response variable as

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:43.220
the introduced variance shows up added to the output of the regression.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.680
To combat this, I considered going the classification route
