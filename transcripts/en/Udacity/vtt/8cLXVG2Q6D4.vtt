00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to the first unit of our course on differential equations and simulation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this unit and the next, we'll look into how to bring the crew of Apollo 13 back to earth.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We start with writing programs that model the orbit of the moon

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and of the spacecraft around the earth.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This unit contains quite a number of supplementary segments

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to bring everybody up to speed.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you know your way around derivatives and vectors and elementary Python programming,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.461
feel free to skip directly to the quizzes of those segments.
