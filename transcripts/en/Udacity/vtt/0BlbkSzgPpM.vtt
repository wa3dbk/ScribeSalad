00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.304
Welcome back, we're moving fast through this course. This week, we've explored

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:08.444
rational functions. We learned about how to sketch their graphs, find their

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:12.940
domain and range, and any vertical and horizontal asymptotes. In our

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.774
investigations, we also encountered slant asymptotes. Finally, we began looking

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:22.810
at graphing and answer questions about piecewise function. As usual, we have a

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.019
few problems from the recent work to summarize. Let's look at those now.
