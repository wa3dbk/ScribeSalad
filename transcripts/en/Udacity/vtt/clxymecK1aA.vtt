00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.896
The internet supports heterogeneity through the

00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:07.490
TCP/IP protocol stack. TCP/IP was designed as

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.880
a monolithic transport, where TCP provided flow

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.260
control and reliable delivery, and IP provided

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.810
universal forwarding. Now it became clear

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.380
that not every application needed reliable in

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.670
order delivery. For example, streaming voice and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.540
video. Often perform well, even if not

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.880
every packet is delivered. And the domain

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.620
name system, which converts domain names to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.210
IP addresses, often also doesn't need completely

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.860
reliable in order delivery. Fortunately, the narrow

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.450
waste of IP allowed the proliferation of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.190
many different transport protocols, not just TCP.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.630
The second way that the internet's design

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.570
accomodates Hetergeneity is through a best-effort service

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.230
model, whereby the network can lose packets, deliver them out of order, and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.330
doesn't really provide any quality guarantees.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.380
It also doesn't provide information about failures,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.760
performance, et cetera. On the plus side, this makes for a simple design,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.500
but it also makes certain kinds

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.150
of debugging and network management more difficult.
