00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.600
Now that we know what the reorder buffer is supposed to look like let's see

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.320
how it's used. For that we need a reorder buffer with its commit and

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.460
issue points and we need the rest of the processor that we have already seen.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.730
The instruction queue, the reservation stations, registers and the RAT.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.570
Let's say that we have this add instruction here in the instruction queue.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.780
So now we want to see what happens once we start issuing this all

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.120
the way to once we eventually commit this instruction. In a process that now has

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.570
a reorder buffer. So let's see what happens when instruction issue. As before,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.950
when we didn't have the reorder buffer, we get a free reservation station. And

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.950
we put our instruction in it. Now that we do have a reorder buffer we will also

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.770
get one of those, unlike reservation station, where we just need a free one,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.510
it doesn't matter which one it is. Here we need to get the entry that is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.730
the next one at the issue point. So, R instruction will go

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.080
here in the reorder buffer. That of course also means that our

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.120
issue point will now move and points to the next entry in the reorder buffer. So

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.730
now we have seven instructions that have been issued and have not yet committed.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.495
Another thing that we had to do, when we were issuing instructions into

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:27.230
Tomasulo's algorithm, is that the RAT entry for R1. The destination

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.830
registry of the instruction needed to be pointed to the reservation station for

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.980
the instruction. We will still need to do this pointing, but instead of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.770
the reservation station, now we point the RAT entry to the ROB entry for

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.910
the instruction. That means that this RAT entry will be now instead of pointing

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.440
to the reservation station be pointing to this entry here.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.790
So overall at the end of the cycle when we issue this instruction,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.100
we will occupy reservation station with the values that we found for

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.700
these registers. We will make the RAT point to the ROB6 entry. And

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.130
in this entry, we will say that R1 will need to be written for this instruction.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.950
And we don't still have the value, so the done bit is 0 here for

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.630
this instruction. Now this add here might wait for operands to become ready.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.980
And that happens exactly as before with Tomasulo's algorithm.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.540
We just capture results that we need, and we are ready to dispatch once we

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.210
have all the operands. Eventually, the add has all the things that it needs to

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.640
dispatch. And the dispatching works exactly the same as before. So, we check

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.530
whether the operands are ready. And when they are, we send the instruction for

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.830
execution. But now we can also free the reservation station as soon as we

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.320
dispatch. Previously with Tomasulo's algorithm, we needed to wait for

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.240
the reservation station release all the way until this instruction broadcast its

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.770
result. That was needed because the reservation station serves as the name for

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.160
the result. Now that the name for the result is the ROB entry,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.110
we no longer need the reservation stations to play the troll.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.140
So the reservation station now does only its primary job, which is wait for

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.060
operands and capture them. And then, figure out which instructions to dispatch.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.790
After that the reservation station for the instruction is done so

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.980
we can free it. So now we add executes and carries with it the tag of ROB6

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.900
which is the name for it's result. Eventually it produces a result.
