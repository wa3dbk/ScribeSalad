00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The fourth final exam question is another creative application as in concepts you've learned.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're going to deal with a three-body problem.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's say that we've three stars--one with a small mass, one with the twice the smallest star's mass,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and one very large star with three times this mass.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Given the certain initial 3D configuration of these stars, we want you to figure out

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how to position and graph each change of time.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
One piece of information that's going to be very important is this equation as the gravitational force

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
between two bodies, which you should remember from all the new units.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Tremendous that this force is actually vector quantity.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to be super explicit in putting a vector sign on top of that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Remember, all three of these bodies exert a force one way or another.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In the code you can see that we've written out the mass at each star for you

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
as well as the gravitational constant big G.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We've dealt with everything concerning time for you and all left for you to do

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is to implement this symplectic Euler method for the motion of the stars we did write above.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When that is symplectic Euler method if the kind of half implicit, half explicit method

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that'll help you find the position and velocity of each star.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Just show your result and surprise you. This is a chaotic system.

00:01:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
See it showed a pretty interesting looking graph.
