00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.025
So now we'll take a look and see if our

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:05.130
changes got propagated to the API's Explorer. You may find that

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.130
you need to refresh the API's Explorer to get the latest

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.180
changes. So you drill down to the conference API and again

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.510
with the safe profile, look at the safe profile and

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.500
here you'll see now, here you'll see now, that we have

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.780
the request body property showing up or the request property field

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.360
showing up. If you click in it, and this is really

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.860
cool, you'll see the add a property menu. You

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.650
go ahead and click that to bring the menu up,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.160
and it'll show you the properties that you're allowed to

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.120
add. So we're going to add a display name. Let's say

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.020
we'll se it to Lauren. Now we're going to go

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.200
ahead and add another property, we'll add a T-shirt size.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.110
Set that to M for medium and we execute it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.400
and you see the request that got sent? The display

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.350
name was Lauren, T-shirt size M and we also

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.720
see the response. Which is the profile that got

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.818
created. The display name is Lauren, T-shirt size is

00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:02.480
M. So these are the same fields that are defined

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.890
in the profile form class. Which is the input

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.200
of the parameter to the save profile method. So hopefully

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.000
you've learned how you can restrict the input to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.120
the, API by passing the argument in the API function.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.320
Now it's your turn to update the save

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.350
profile function in conference API to take the profile

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.558
form param as an input argument. You'll be implementing

00:01:28.558 --> 00:01:32.280
the code marked with TODO1, look for the one.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.040
The method has a couple different places where

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.960
you'll need to be adding code, but this time

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.340
we're just doing the places marked TODO1. Go ahead

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.480
and add the profile form argument to the save

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.820
profile method in the conference API class. And

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.905
go ahead and do the other sections marked

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:51.760
TODO1 to get the arguments out of the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.290
profile form argument that gets passed in. When

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.670
you've made your changes, run your app on

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.540
localhost and visit it in API's Explorer, and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.010
then go ahead and explore. See what happens

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.832
when you execute the save conference function. Try executing

00:02:07.832 --> 00:02:10.257
it with and without providing the display

00:02:10.257 --> 00:02:12.770
name and the T-shirt size parameters. When

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.810
you've tested it out on localhost and it's working like you think it should,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.910
go ahead and deploy your app to app spot. And when you're ready you

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.950
can enter your app ID here and press submit so Udacity can test your code.
