00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.330
Physicians usually start collecting
data by interviewing the patient,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.710
beginning with their chief complaint,
the reason for their current visit.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.630
They ask about other problems and
obtain the history of those.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.330
To further explore the chief complaint,
they ask about symptoms,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.420
manifestations of the problem
that the patient has noticed, and

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.220
they physically examine the patient.
