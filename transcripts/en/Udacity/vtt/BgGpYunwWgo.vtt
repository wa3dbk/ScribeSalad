Okay, here are my answers. As you can see basically, you know, mem

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.520
cache got's the hash table and dictionaries in Python are hash tables as

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.340
well. The semantics line up really nicely. So all of these functions are

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.280
very simple. Set cache key to value. No problem return true. To get,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.690
we actually can use the get function that's built in the Python dictionaries,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.450
which is basically says get key. And if the key is not there,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.500
it will return none. If we've typed something like this, this would raise

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.480
an exception. If, if the key isn't in the cache, Python would complain.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.320
And the get function is used to avoid that problem. Deleting a key

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.640
in the cache. So, first of all what we would do is, if the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.460
key is in the cache, then delete it. And this is the Python

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.450
syntax for deleting something from a dictionary.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.450
Another way of doing this would be,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.972
to use the pop function. Which is built in the Python and what

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:44.390
basi, basically this says is, find the key in, in the dictionary. And if

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.750
it's there, return it, otherwise return false. And if you don't have this false,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.530
this will raise an exception. I find this approach to be a little bit

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.860
more readable, however. So which is why I did it that way.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.620
And of course flushing a cache is easy. You just call clear

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.950
on the dictionary. And let's give all these a run real quick

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.140
to see if they work. I'm going to go down to my test little

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.070
test harness here. And uncomment all these operations and then we'll give

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.340
this a run. And we can see that things work. We set

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.150
x to 1. And we get back true, which is what we

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.670
expected, we get x. And we can see that the value is one.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.760
We get y. The value is none, because y is not in the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.215
cache. And then we delete x and then try to get it. And

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.010
we see that x is now none. Okay. So our basic cache is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.165
working. Good job on that. And let's move on to some more advanced mem-cache.
