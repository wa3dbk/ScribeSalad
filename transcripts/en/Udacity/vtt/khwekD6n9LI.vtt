00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:07.070
[UNKNOWN] Also has effect on the latency that uses [UNKNOWN] as well as the loss

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.904
rate. Here we've shown how [UNKNOWN] latency

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:14.520
effect for two different users. The latency is

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.110
shown in terms of round trip time in milliseconds and the loss rate are shown

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.290
on the right side of the Y axis. Latencies are also shown on a log scale.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.740
In this particular experiment, we start sending traffic here

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.560
and we stop sending traffic here, in both cases.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.810
We can see that, even though power boost allows

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.000
you to just send at a higher traffic rate,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.030
actually users may experience high latency and loss. Over

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.120
the duration that they're sending at a higher rate.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.460
The reason for this is that the access link

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.460
may not be able to support the higher rate.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.080
So if a sender can only send at r sustained for an extended period of time but

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.740
is allowed to burst at a rate r

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.400
for some shorter period of time, Then buffers may

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.480
fill up and the resulting buffers may introduce

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.350
additional delays in the network since packets are being

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.290
buffered up rather than dropped. TCP senders can continue

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.450
to send at higher rates, such as little r,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.880
without seeing any packet loss even though the access link may not be able to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.940
send at that higher rate. As a result,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.200
packets buffer up and users see higher latency

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.035
over the course of the power boost

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:34.070
[UNKNOWN]. To solve this problem, you might imagine

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.030
instead that a sender might shape it's rate

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.370
never to exceed the sustained rate, Big R.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.780
If it did this, then it could avoid seeing these latency effects.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.760
So, search and senders, who are more interested in keeping latency under

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.810
control, then they are in-sending at births devoims, may wish

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.610
to run a traffic shaper in front of a power

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.550
boost enabled link. So shaping traffic to a rate of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.040
less than this sustained rate r can prevent this buffering. More details

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.940
about power boost and the experiments that we've run to keep latency under

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.320
control in its presence are available in a paper we wrote called Broadband

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.279
Internet Performance, A view from the Gateway. Which appeared in Sigcomm 2011.
