00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.610
Welcome to this course
on Android design.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.770
I'm Nick, a Design Advocate at Google.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.730
&gt;&gt; And I'm James,
a course developer at Udacity.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.790
&gt;&gt; And I'm Roman,
also a Design Advocate at Google.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.660
&gt;&gt; If you haven't
figured it out already,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.050
this is a course on Android design.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.430
&gt;&gt; With over a million apps
in the Google Play Store,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.490
design is an important element
to making your apps stand out.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.280
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.910
And unlike the early days of Android, it
isn't enough just to have a good idea,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.190
and to implement it.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.570
Your users will expect, nay,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.950
demand something that's easy to use and
beautiful.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.776
&gt;&gt; In this lesson,

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:36.083
we will start with a quick overview
of Android design principles.

00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:40.473
In the rest of the course we'll explore
key Android design principles through

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:44.635
the lens of material design,
the new visual language in Android 5.0.

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:45.855
Let's get started.
