00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.750
Jellyfish's topology is what is called a random regular graph.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.030
It's random because each graph is uniformly selected

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.740
at random from the set of all regular graphs. A regular

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.900
graph is simply one where each node has the same degree. And a graph in

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.400
Jellyfish is one where the switches in

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.350
the topology are the nodes. In contrast to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.980
the earlier data center topology diagram we saw, here is a picture of a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.980
Jellyfish random graph with 432 servers and 180 switches. Every node in this

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.800
graph has a fixed degree of 12. Jellyfish's approach is to construct

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.550
a random graph at the Top of Rack switch layer. Every Top of Rack switch i,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.070
has some total number of Ki ports, of which it uses Ri

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.420
to connect to other Top of Rack switches. The remaining Ki minus Ri

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.332
ports are used to connect servers. With n racks,

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:10.994
the network then supports n times Ki minus Ri

00:01:10.994 --> 00:01:15.950
servers. And the network is a random regular graph

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.220
denoted as follows. Formally, random regular graphs are sampled

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.370
uniformly from the space of all R regular graphs. Achieving such a property is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.370
a complex graph theory problem, but there's a simple procedure that produces a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.370
sufficiently uniform random graph that empirically have the desired properties.
