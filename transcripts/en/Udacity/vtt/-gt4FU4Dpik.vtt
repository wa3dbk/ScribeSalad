00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's proof time again! 3 AM in the recording studio. And as always, this is entirely optional.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This goes way beyond what will ever be taught in an introduction to statistics class.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's only for those who love hard-to-prove challenges.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And as previously, we're going to prove the correctness of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the maximum likelihood estimator or MLE but this time for Gaussians.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Our Xi's can now be arbitrary values not just 0s or 1s.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And the mean and the variance are computed using these two now familiar formula.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
How can we prove this to be correct? Again, last chance to skip.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
As before, there's the proof on the left side with a couple of blanks five in total.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And there's seven expressions that you can put in

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the way you put them in is if for example the seventh expression

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in your opinion fits over here you put the number 7 in here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You only use each expression on the right side once,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and there's obviously more expressions on the right side than the holes on the left side.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Let me quickly go over the proof.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
In maximizing the probability of the data, we first state the probability of these data items

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and then send over here using a normal distribution with prime of µ and σ².

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But that left something unknown on the left that you have to pick from the right side.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Then we take the logarithm of this and here's the logarithm with two gaps in sight.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We take the first derivative of the logarithm that you have to compute

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
by picking the appropriate term on the right

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and set it to 0, which is where the maximum is obtained.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
From there, we can transform the expression to this expression over here where I left out a term

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and it finally gives you the desired proof for the maximum likelihood estimator for the mean.

00:01:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Good luck!
