00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
During lecture this week, we learned about context-free grammars and languages

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and about parsing them. But is there anything beyond that?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Is there anything other than the context-free grammars

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and the regular languages that we've learned so far?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Is there anything more powerful?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's an excellent question.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It turns out that context-free grammars are not the end-all and be-all

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of interpreting languages like JavaScript or HTML.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In fact, just as we saw that regular languages and regular expressions

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
weren't powerful enough to do everything we needed--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
they couldn't handle balanced parentheses, so we couldn't use them for parsing--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it's going to turn out that context-free languages and context-free grammars

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
will only take us so far,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and we're going to use additional techniques like interpretation

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or keeping track of local variables in order to find other things out.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here's a great example of what the "free" in context-free actually means.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You might think, "Boy, is there a context-expensive grammar out there?"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
"What's the opposite of free?"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It turns out in this domain the opposite of free is context-sensitive,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and it's going to turn out that the meaning of a program depends on its context.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
For example, suppose I ask you what's X + 2?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The meaning of that program depends a lot on the local value of X.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So we're going to need something more than just parsing,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
more than context-free grammars, to reason about programs

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that include substrings like X + 2.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If right above it I've written X = 4, then X = 4, X + 2 yields 6.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But if right above it I've written X = 0, then we'd get a different answer.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That line above it is the context.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Our context-free grammar doesn't care about the line above it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You can write down X + 2 even if you've never assigned to X before.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
When we go to write our interpreter for JavaScript

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and our ability to render web pages by interpreting HTML,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we're going to need to keep track of the context, the values, the variables,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
what has gone before, our history.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
All of that is going to matter for figuring out the true interpretations of programs.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So again, just as regular expressions weren't powerful enough

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and we needed context-free grammars for parsing,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we're going to need something else, context sensitivity, to make our final web server.

00:02:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And we're going to get to that in around Unit 5 in this class, so stay tuned.
