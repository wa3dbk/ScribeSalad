00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.492
We just established that the volume of a sound, or its loudness, gets lower or

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:10.444
decreases as the distance from the sound source increases. I've drawn four

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:14.388
graphs for you here and I'd like you to tell me which ones show loudness

00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:20.604
decreasing as distance increases. Please note loudness is on the vertical axis

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:24.070
in all these graphs and distances on the horizontal axis.
