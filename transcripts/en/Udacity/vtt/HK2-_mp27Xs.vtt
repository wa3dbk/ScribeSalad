00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's discuss an example of SPD and
SADB.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.420
Recall that in transfer mode,
the traffic is protected end to end,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.830
whereas internal mode,
the traffic is protected

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.160
between the gateway of one network
to the gateway of another network.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.780
First, let's consider the end to end,
or transfer mode policy from A to B.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.950
Suppose the policy says that for

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.810
any traffic from A to B,
the packets need to be authenticated.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.870
And further,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.800
the suggested algorithm is to use HMAC
with MD5 as the embedded hash function.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.850
This policy is stored
as an entry in SPD.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.940
The negotiated parameters, again A and

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.710
B, are store in SA in both A and
B's SADB.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.340
For A's SADB,
it stores a secret key for HMAC and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.840
SPI for looking up the SA in B's SADB.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.450
Then when A sends out traffic to B it
can include this SPI in the IPsec header

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.720
so that B can use it to look up
the SA and un-process the traffic.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.260
Now let's take a look at
the tunnel mode traffic

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.190
from the subnet that A belongs to,
to the subnet that B belongs to.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.260
Suppose the policy says that for any
traffic From A's subnet to B's subnet,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.400
the tunnel's destination
is B's gateway which is D,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.820
and the data should be encrypted,
therefore ESP should be used,

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.080
and further, 3DES is requested.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.110
Since C is the gateway of
the subnet that A belongs to,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010
C's SPD stores this policy.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.865
And its SADB stores the SA
that has a 3DES key.

00:01:47.865 --> 00:01:51.940
And SPI, for
looking up SA in these SADB.
