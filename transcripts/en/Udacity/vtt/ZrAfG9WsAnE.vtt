00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.788
If a quadratic equation is in this form, we can simply divide both sides by a,

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:09.040
and then take the square root of both sides to find x. If we divide both sides

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.950
by a, we'll get x squared is equal to c divided by a. And now we take the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.975
square root of both sides. When we take the square root of both sides, we need

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.450
to add a plus or minus symbol in front of the side that doesn't have a

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.911
variable. And here's why we include this plus or minus sign. Think about if I

00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:29.642
had x squared equals 1. I know there are really two values that make this true.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:35.850
Positive 1 squared would equal 1, and negative 1 squared would also equal 1.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.805
This means when we solve and take the square root of both sides. We need to add

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.977
the plus or minus symbol to account for both the positive and the negative

00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:48.360
answer. The square root of x squared is x and the square root of 1 is 1. So

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.680
really x could be positive 1 like we thought or x could equal negative 1. So

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.618
you see if you can use the square root method. Try solving this equation by

00:00:57.618 --> 00:00:59.170
following these steps.
