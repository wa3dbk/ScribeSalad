00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.560
Let me give an example of the limited
dynamic range of current cameras.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.260
Here's is an image I took again,
in my home.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.030
Here, basically, a short exposure,
remembering again the concepts of

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.920
exposure that we looked at from
exposure triangle and stuff when

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.100
we talk about cameras, and here if you
look at it, you should be able to see,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.540
it's a dark scene but outside you
can see a little bit of snow.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.080
I took this picture on you know, one
of the rare snowy days in Atlanta but

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.930
it's a short exposure, you can't
see any of the details inside but

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.800
look outside, you can see
a lot of snow and brightness.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.150
Same image or same scene,
different exposure values.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.600
Long exposure, of course,
all of the insides are nice and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.818
visible now but
you might think that there's a lot of

00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:52.530
overexposure going on at this point and
the details outside are not good.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.735
So this is an underexposed image,
this is an overexposed image.

00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:59.620
Underexposed because lots of
pixels did not get any detail,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.430
lots of black pixels here.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.319
Overexposed, a lot of white,
bright pixels.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.590
So you, if you were to build
histograms of these images,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.450
you would start seeing a lot more on
the white pixels and for this one,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.590
you'd see a lot more black pixels.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.260
Again note,
both of them are exactly the same scene.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.870
They are not even
a different time of the day.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.110
They were taken seconds
after each other and

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.790
that's the kind of stuff that basically
old cameras give you right now, and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.510
that is a limited dynamic range and
now, of course,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.620
we're interested in its capturing
the range from here to there.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.100
To capture this dynamic range,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.330
we basically need 5-10 million values
to store all the brightness around us.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.960
Remember the luminosity
stuff that I showed you.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.230
The scale information was significant.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.596
Here we want to basically able to
capture all of this in one image.

00:01:44.596 --> 00:01:49.090
Problem is, and recall when we started
talking about images, most images

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.390
capture each of the three different
channels in basic 8 bit images,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.560
values of 0 to 255, sometime basically
just put in values of 0 to 1.0 but

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.530
again, there are only
256 values as opposed

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.020
to a much brighter range that would
cover the range from here to there.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.860
Nowhere close to, of course, being able
to capture 5 to 10 million values.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.250
Just to showcase this,
let's look at this example again.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.950
Here, if you notice,
I'm showing you the high dynamic range.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.389
In the real world, this was a dynamic
range from 10 raised to minus 6 to 10

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:27.028
raised to 6, and
that's what we're trying to look at.

00:02:27.028 --> 00:02:31.570
Of course, on a photograph, what we
would most likely do is just showcase

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.470
this one and
that's what basically is shown here.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.390
I'm basically showing all the values
that are much more on the brighter side

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.130
and focusing it here.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.490
The other end of the spectrum is
the long exposure and of course,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.090
this is the long exposure, and mention
again a lot more bright values and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.830
here what we'll be doing in this dynamic
range is most probably just capture

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.969
the region here and
pack it into my 0 to 255 values.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.940
Again, a lot of detail would be lost.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.280
Here, I'm basically showing you more
of the information on this side of

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.790
the spectrum.
