00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.469
The third method we have
is something you are.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.330
That's the biometric method.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.450
So, what exactly is that?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.860
So obviously,
there are a variety of biometrics and

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.430
it should be unique to you.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.350
Somebody else shouldn't be able
to use a biometric feature or

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.950
set of features to impersonate you,
so what are some examples?

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.330
Fingerprints are one.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.450
You swipe your finger for example, touch
ID and things like that and they look

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.680
for the pattern in your fingerprints and
based on that they say it's really you.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.395
When it comes to keyboard if
nothing else, the way you type, or

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:36.335
the keystroke dynamics,
how fast you are, how long you take

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.635
from one key to the next depending on
what the keys are and things like that.

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:44.455
Sometimes that is used as
a biometric features derived from

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:47.560
this speed at which you type,
or pattern of your typing,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.850
could be a biometric
that's unique to you.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.700
Actually seeing devices that do
voice biometric authentication.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.870
They extract a set of features from your
voice which hopefully is unique to you,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.490
and that can be used when
you talk to the device,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.100
it knows that it's really you.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.760
And, of course, they're more intrusive
and fancier one like retina scan and

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.130
things like that, which look for
sort of unique patterns

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.670
based on the blood flow in your eye,
and things like that.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.820
So these are basically what you are.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.650
The way these work, is that you're
going to claim it's you and

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.140
you're going to swipe your finger,
or you talk in case of voice.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.760
But the biometric measurement
should be the same each time.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.240
If it's different then of course
we're going to have a false negative.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.830
It's you but you're not able to
login because you have a cold and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.420
your voice is a little different.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.190
So maybe you don't have
exact of these measurements.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.560
Maybe you have a probability
distribution for

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.690
your other features that we extract
from your biometric measurements.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.050
And of course we're going to
have false positives and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.560
false negatives, as we have with each
authentication method that we discussed.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.050
Here, if your biometric measurements
change beyond a certain limit,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.460
then of course you may
not be able to login.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.340
Resulting in this false negative
that we were talking about.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.532
So the basic way of implementing
biometric is there has to be

00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:13.610
a biometric sensor, there's some user
interface where you swipe your finger or

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.935
camera takes a picture of you or
where you talk to it, or wherever it is.

00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:19.940
That the interface, the sensor,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.470
then from the biometric reading we're
going to extract a bunch of features

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.580
that actually describe the reading
that we just have from the sensor.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.230
And that's passed to a biometric
database that stores these features, or

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.480
something that derives
from these features.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.150
So PIN is here,
as sort of a separate thing we may have,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.310
in addition too, PIN is something
you know, so that's the secret.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.771
But say if you just sort
of going with biometric,

00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:43.639
you would not have the top line here.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.420
So the biometric database seems
like a hash values for passwords.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.230
We have something that describes
the biometric feature set and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.010
feature values for a given user.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.330
So once you extract
the feature we compare those.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.660
If there's a match between these two,
then we allow authentication.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.970
If there isn't a match then we're
going to say that authentication

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.990
is not allowed.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.050
So the idea is that you still
have the enrollment problem.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.766
Somebody has to have a description
of your biometric features,

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:12.080
which is the database
where we'll be storing it.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.100
The sensor has to read it, the features
have to be extracted, the comparison or

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.290
match has to happen.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.460
And that's how biometric
authentication works.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.650
So that when you're typing a password,
we sort of reading through the interface

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.840
and the sensor and then it's sort
of similar to what we had before.
