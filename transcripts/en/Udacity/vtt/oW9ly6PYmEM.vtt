00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:04.037
Open up the Developer API Guide 
for Settings, if you want to follow along.

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:06.220
If you've pondered it carefully
and you've decided

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.132
you really want this to be a setting,
this is what you do next.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:13.291
Android provides a way 
to display a hierarchy of preferences,

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.434
including headers, 
such as the ones shown here.

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:19.578
The value of the preference 
is called the preference summary,

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:21.113
and that's seen here.

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:23.534
It looks almost like the subtitle text.

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:28.261
The preference also provides UI
to allow users to modify that setting.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.986
You just need to supply the strings,

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:33.448
but you don't have to implement the UI
like the spinner here.

00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:36.029
Common preference types 
are the check box preference,

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:37.995
list preference, edit text preference.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.252
We can see some examples 
in the settings app

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:41.900
under developer options.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.700
Here's a bunch of preferences.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.472
This is an example
of a check box preference.

00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:48.994
This is an example of a list preference

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:51.556
where you have different 
radio button options here.

00:00:52.248 --> 00:00:54.449
Once the user changes the setting,

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.549
it gets saved in the default share 
preferences file.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.451
This stores a bunch of key value pairs
of primitive data.

00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:05.784
An example integer preference could be
how many days of e-mail history

00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:08.254
should be saved locally on the device.

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:10.792
You could have a string 
stored integer preferences

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:15.088
for what the currently selected account 
and device is. Then at any time

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:17.372
you can fetch the value 
of this shared preferences,

00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:20.046
as long as you pass in 
the name of the key that you want.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.969
You can also use shared preferences
outside the context of settings as well.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:26.961
This information is located 
in the developer API guide,

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.891
for storage options, 
which is also linked below.
