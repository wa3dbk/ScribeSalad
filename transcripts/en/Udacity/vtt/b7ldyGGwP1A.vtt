00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.826
Let's take a step back, and see how far we've come in solving this problem. We

00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:08.350
started out with our function, f of x equals 2 x to the fourth, minus 13 x

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.872
cubed, plus 32 x squared, minus 13 x. And so far, we've pulled out two linear

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:21.790
factors. Now we have x times 2 x minus 1, times x squared, minus 6 x plus 13.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.363
We are clearly well on our way to having this fully factored. All we have left

00:00:25.363 --> 00:00:27.946
to do, is figure out the zeros that go along with this quadratic expressions

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:33.208
right here. What then, are the zeros of x squared minus 6 x plus 13? Please

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:34.973
write them in these boxes.
