00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.910
So we know that this blue curve gives us a pretty good estimate of the world

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.690
population. But, how good is it really? Well, current estimates right now say

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.329
that the world population in 2013 is just under 7.1 billion people. So is the

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.215
actually population growth of the world slower or faster than this graph

00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:26.030
predicts? In other words, are there more people or fewer people than predicted

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.330
here. Slower growth means that there are actually fewer people. And faster

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.510
growth means that there are actually more people than the blue graph shows.
