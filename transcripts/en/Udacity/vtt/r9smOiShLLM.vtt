00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.290
In this level, we set up Android Studio
which was a big operation.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.880
Then we learned a bit about
the Git version control system and

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.490
downloaded the course code from GitHub.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.780
Then we learned about the structure of
a libGDX project and about the Gradle

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.886
build tool that actually compiles and
packages the games we'll build.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.260
Then we imported our first libGDX
project into Android Studio and

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.850
set up a new run configuration
to launch the desktop backend.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.880
Next, we launched the Android backend.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.897
Finally, we made a small
tweak to the game and

00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:30.991
got some more practice launching
the desktop and Android backends.

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.400
That was a lot of work.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.380
Awesome job taking care of all
the setup and background work.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.254
Next level is all about drawing.

00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:41.655
We'll start with some basic shapes and
work up to some crazy fractals.

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:42.290
See you there.
