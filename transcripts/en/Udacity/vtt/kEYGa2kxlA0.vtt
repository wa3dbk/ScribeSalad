00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.332
Throughout evolution, humans brains have grown larger and more complex. And

00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:08.610
that allows us to do all the amazing things that we can do. Everything about

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.209
who we are, what we like, how we think, what we dream. And even how we feel is

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.290
a function of our brain and its electrical and chemical activities. The nervous

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.638
system is divided into the central nervous system that is comprised of the

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:26.635
brain and the spinal cord. And the peripheral nervous system that consists of

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:30.868
the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary behavior. And the

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:35.716
autonomic nervous system that controls involuntary behavior. The autonomic

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:39.108
nervous system is further broken down into the sympathetic nervous system,

00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:44.200
which is our fight or flight responses. And the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.982
which produces the opposite effects and relaxes the sympathetic nervous system.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:53.538
Neurons are specialized cells that communicate with each other via electrical

00:00:53.538 --> 00:00:58.554
and chemical signals. Sensory neurons receives sensory information and send it

00:00:58.554 --> 00:01:03.178
to the brain for processing. The brain then sends information to our motor

00:01:03.178 --> 00:01:06.289
neurons that allow us respond appropriately, and the interneurons form

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:11.473
connections between neurons. After an action potential has occurred, neurons

00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:15.024
can release neurotransmitters, which are naturally occurring chemicals that

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:20.794
produce a cascade of effects. Some important neurotransmitters in the study of

00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:27.123
psychology are, Dopamine, Serotonin, Acetycholine, Gabba, and Glutamate. As

00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:32.534
well as our natural occurring Endorphins. The brain is divided into twp

00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:38.531
hemispheres, left and right. And those communicate via the corpus collosum. The

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:43.106
upper-most portion of the brain is the cerebrum. And the frontal lobe is

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:47.586
important for attention, working memory, impulse control, and abstract thinking

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:52.700
and creativity. It is the youngest part of the brain and the part that makes us

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.310
most human. We are better able to determine what the different parts of the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.535
brain are responsible for due to advances in brain imaging techniques such as

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:08.902
EEG, fMRI, and PET scans. These allow for researchers to see what parts of the

00:02:08.902 --> 00:02:12.116
brain are activated when we engage in various activities, such as talking,

00:02:12.116 --> 00:02:14.620
reading or even dreaming.
