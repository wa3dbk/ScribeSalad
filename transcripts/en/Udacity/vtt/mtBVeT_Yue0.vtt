00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.280
JavaScript frameworks
are incredibly powerful tools.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.640
They will empower you to build
complicated projects with ease.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.870
They also help teams to get up and
running quickly.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.810
All while maintaining code
consistency and quality.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.210
Before we begin,
I do want to stress two things.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.234
First, is that will be taking a deep
dive into some pretty advanced

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:20.939
JavaScript language features and
programming concepts.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.746
This course builds on web tooling and

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:27.160
automation, JavaScript design patterns
and object oriented JavaScript.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.130
To really get the most
out of the material,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.340
make sure you're comfortable with these
topics discussed in these courses.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.618
Check in the instructor notes for
links to these courses.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:38.298
Most importantly, make sure you're
comfortable working with JavaScript

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:41.804
objects, especially how prototypal
inheritance works, functions,

00:00:41.804 --> 00:00:43.239
how lexical scope works, and

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.230
closures with the data hiding
capabilities that they provide.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.240
The second thing i want to stress is
the importance of both watching and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.238
working along with me
throughout the course.

00:00:52.238 --> 00:00:55.350
Don't just sit back and watch
the videos, but take an active role,

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.823
walk through the code with me and

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:00.950
make sure you actually attempt
the quizzes and challenges yourself.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.450
If you stick with it and
carefully work through the code I

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.290
know you'll come out with skills
you can really be proud of.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.010
This is a challenging course.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.254
So if you feel like you're starting to
get overwhelmed in some of the videos,

00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:13.379
stop, seriously.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:17.330
Sometimes all it takes for something
to just click is just to take a break.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.740
Go for a walk around the block.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.250
Do something totally different to clear
your head while I was making this course

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.210
it felt like I walked around
the block every single day.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.410
So, ready to get going?

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.910
Let's do it.
