00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.740
Now we're going to go through
a series of languages and

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.470
try to figure out if they and
their compliments are recognizable.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.770
First, let's examine the set of strings
that describe a turning machine that

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.190
has at most a 100 states.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.980
You can assume the particular encoding
for turning machines that we used, but

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.530
any encoding will serve
the same purpose.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.026
Indicate whether you think
that L is recognizable.

00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:26.236
And whether you think L
complement is recognizable.

00:00:26.236 --> 00:00:29.265
Now we don't have a way of proving yet
that a language is not recognizable, so

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:31.050
I've labeled the no
option also as unclear.
