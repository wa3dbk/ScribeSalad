00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.110
The solutions for x are 3 plus or minus 4 root 3, all divided by 2 great

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.563
algebra work for getting that one correct. First we want to isolate the square

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:14.778
by adding 48 to both sides of our equation. So, we'll keep this squared

00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:19.328
quantity on the left and we'll have positive 48 on the right. Next we take the

00:00:19.328 --> 00:00:23.920
square root of both sides and indicate the plus or minus root here. This square

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.995
root undoes our square so we're left with the quantity 2x minus three. On the

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:33.482
right we still just have plus or minus root 48. We add three to both sides to

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:38.830
isolate our 2x, and then we divide both sides by 2, this coefficient. When we

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.795
divide both sides by 2 we're left with 1x on the left and 3 plus or minus root

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:48.314
48 divided by 2 on the right. Next we just simplify the square root of 48 to

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:54.514
get this answer. Keep in mind you could divide 2 into each of these terms. This

00:00:54.514 --> 00:00:59.095
would give us x equal to 3 halves plus or minus 2 root 3. If you list your

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:03.730
answers like this, or if you list your answers like this, they're both correct.
