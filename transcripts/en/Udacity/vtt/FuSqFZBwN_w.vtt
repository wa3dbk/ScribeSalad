00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.640
Today, we'll talk about another knowledge representation called scripts.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.040
Scripts allow us to make sense of discourses and stories and

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.280
scenes. Scripts are the culmination of of frames and understanding and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.650
common sense reasoning these last few lessons. We'll take what we learned about

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.530
frames and understanding and common sense reasoning to build superior scripts.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.010
We'll start by defining scripts, then we'll talk about the form and

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.760
the content of scripts. Then we'll discuss how we can use scripts to

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.840
generate expectations about discourses and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.490
stories that help us make sense of the world around us. Finally, we'll

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.930
talk about the hierarchical nature of scripts. I think you'll enjoy this lesson.
