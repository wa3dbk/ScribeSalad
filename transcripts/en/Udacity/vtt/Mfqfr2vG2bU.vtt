Well, first thing's first, I wanted the answer to this question to be in minutes,

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.307
but the time we have up here is 8 hours

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:11.220
so let's convert that to minutes to start off.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.807
So 8 hours times 60 minutes in one hour gives us 480 minutes.

00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:21.699
Great, so this is the exposure time for an 85 decibel sound.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.254
We want to know what this is for a 100 decibel sound,

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.903
so let's look at this last piece of information.

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:31.275
If the exposure time before damage is cut in half every time the power doubles,

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:35.928
we need to think about how many times the power doubles from 85 decibels to 100 decibels.

00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:40.332
We knew before that it was 5 times.

00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:45.798
So if the power doubles 5 times, that means that our exposure time is halved 5 times.

00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:51.631
So we need to take 480 minutes and multiply it by one half five times.

00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.712
That doesn't seem too bad.

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:56.669
However, we know that if we want to multiply by one half five times,

00:00:56.669 --> 00:01:00.648
that's the same as multiplying by one half to the fifth power.

00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:07.117
One half to the fifth is one over 32, so we're actually dividing 480 by 32.

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:11.402
And that gives us a final answer of 15 minutes.

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:16.102
Now remember that every time the power doubles, we have a decibel increase of 3.

00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:24.584
Some sources state that instead of the exposure time being cut in half for every three decibels, this happens every five decibels,

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:28.822
but I think it's better that we stay on the safe side.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.892
I bet you never thought we would end up talking about ear health

00:01:30.892 --> 00:01:32.247
by the end of this course.

00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:35.465
But that just goes to show you how incredibly applicable algebra is,

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:39.259
in all spheres of life. In just this lesson

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.366
we've talked about everything from sound

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:46.944
to carbon dating, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the population of the world,

00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:50.944
and this happened in just a few questions.
