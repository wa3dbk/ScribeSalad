00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.780
The second step is the preparation itself. During this preparation period,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.990
the participants should individually study the material,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.700
noting any potential defects. The idea here, is to save time in the meeting

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.510
by having the participants detect particularly superficial type

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.600
problems that can be reported to the, reported before the meeting. And not have

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.020
to take time during the meeting to go over them. The expected rate of individual

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.210
review should be about ten pages of text or 100 lines of code per hour.
