00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.052
So we already know that ILP is not equal to

00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:06.180
IPC on any real processor, actually it can be but it's

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.376
not necessarily, so, and that is because ILP is really

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:13.356
the IPC on a perfect processor that does perfect branch prediction.

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:16.416
And only has to follow data dependencies, so now let's

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.272
look at an example of a program and a real processor

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:22.332
and see basically how do we determine ILP, and and how

00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:26.408
do we determine the IPC. So this is our program, and

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:28.424
now let's look at what the processor looks

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:33.400
like. So our processor is two issue, meaning it

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.540
can handle two instructions per cycle. Out of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.960
order super scalar, which means that it doesn't need

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.238
to execute instructions exactly in program order. And

00:00:43.238 --> 00:00:45.758
let's say that it only has one multiplication unit,

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:47.942
and two units that can do what add, subtract,

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:51.550
x, or et cetera. For our ILP, we can

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.350
just ignore all of this, because the ILP, again, is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.810
just the property of a program. So we have to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.640
just obey dependencies. There is a data dependence here, and

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.310
that's only really the only dependence that we have. So as

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.210
far as ILP is concerned, we can do this in

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.940
two cycles. This, this, this, and this would be done in

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.920
the first cycle, and then this would be done in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700
the second cycle because it, it depends on the instruction that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.020
is done in the first cycle. So we have five instructions, over two cycles,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.240
gives us 2.5. In contrast, the IPC for this processor

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.760
needs to consider all the limitations of this processor. So we have this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.350
instruction can be done in the first cycle. This

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.940
one cannot because of a dependence, so therefor the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.730
IPC we still have to obey all the dependencies,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.120
plus we have to also worry about the other limitations

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.520
of the processor. This is an out-of-order processor, so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.006
we are not doing this. But we can still

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.294
look further, because we can do instructions out of

00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:52.531
order. The XOR can be done because we have two

00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:55.716
add subtracted et cetera units so we can do

00:01:55.716 --> 00:02:00.690
this in the first cycle two. This instruction can be

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.174
done in the first cycle, because we can use

00:02:03.174 --> 00:02:07.164
the multiplier. For example, this instruction here cannot be done

00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:09.368
in the first cycle unlike when we computed the

00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:12.470
ILP. It can not be done, because we only have

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.340
two add, subtract, x, or et cetera units, and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.210
we have already consumed both of them in the first

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.420
cycle for the add and the XOR. So in

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.870
the second cycle now, we can do this and this.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.470
So it turns out that I, our IBC is still

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.310
five instructions over two cycles equals 2.5. But it doesn't

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.780
have to be that way. For example, if this

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.520
processor only had one, I would subtract extra units.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.400
We would now have the IPC off. In the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.010
first cycle we can do this. We cannot do this

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.716
because of a dependence. We cannot do this because

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:50.844
are already using our one unit that we have for

00:02:50.844 --> 00:02:54.030
an [UNKNOWN], et cetera. We can do the multiply,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.830
and we can't do this add either. In the second

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.700
cycle, we can do this. We can not do

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.313
any of these other two because, again, we are

00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:06.309
using our add subtract XOR. This will be our

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.360
third cycle, and this will be our fourth cycle.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.629
So, now we have five instructions over four cycles.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.592
And that's equal to 1.25. So this IPC is

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:22.970
half of this IPC, and half of this ILP. So what we can say is that the IPC

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.570
has to be less than or equal to the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.980
ILP. The ILPs for a perfect PROCESSOR. A real prosser

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.400
will have some limitations that will maybe allow it to

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.490
achieve the same IPC as the ILP available in the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.558
application. But sometimes it will not. So what we can

00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:41.726
say is that the ILP is always greater than or

00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:46.150
equal to the IPC on any real PROCESSOR. And again,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.080
we don't really need to know what the prosser is

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.160
to compute the ILP, but we do need to know what

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.380
the prosser looks like when we're computing it's IPC. And we have

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.040
seen that IPC can be equal to the ILP, or it can

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.940
be lower than that, but it can not be larger than that.
