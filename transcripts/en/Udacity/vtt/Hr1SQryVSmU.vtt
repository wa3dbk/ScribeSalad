00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When we are debugging, we proceed the very same way.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Indeed, we're treating bugs as if they were natural phenomenon.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, our hypothesis would be grounded on the initial observation of the failure

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and possible also all the knowledge we do have about our program.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The failing run, more runs, the original failure, program code--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
all of these goes into our forming a hypothesis.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
At the end of the process, we get a consistent description of how the failure came to be.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We don't call this a theory. Theory is a bit far fetched for a simple failure.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Instead, we call this a diagnosis of the original failure.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It may sound a bit far-fetched to apply a method

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that has been devised for studying natural phenomena

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and for coming up with theories about natural phenomena on something as artificial as bugs.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
However, errors and nature have something in common, none of them are under our control.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And the scientific method is precisely the method which you need

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for explaining something that is not under our control.
