00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.250
Let's take a moment to check if
we understand how write-update

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.710
coherence works.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.070
Suppose that a core has
a single block cache

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.870
with a valid bit,
a tag and the data, and

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.390
suppose that we have four such
cores numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.610
Suppose that core 0
reads from 700 first.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.980
So now it gets the valid bit to be 1.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.290
The tag is 700 and
let's say that the data rate is 6.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.830
After this,
core 1 reads the same location.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.600
Then, core 2 writes a value
of 17 into this location.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.030
And finally,
core 3 reads from that location.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.620
After all this, in core 0 what
is the valid bit in the cache?

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.150
The tag is still 700, and
what is the data that we get?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.890
And the same for cores 1, 2, and 3.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.160
What is the valid bit in
each of these caches, and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.360
what's the data value placed here?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.040
You can use this as an example, where
the valid bit is either one or zero, and

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.450
the data value in this
case is 6 after this read.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.780
So, what's going on in these four
caches after we do this sequence?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.500
We complete this, then this,
then this, then this.
