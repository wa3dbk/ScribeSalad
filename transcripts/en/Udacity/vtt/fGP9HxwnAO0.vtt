00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.541
The answer is going to depend on how each Z-def comparison goes. When the object

00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:08.762
is closer than whatever is already in the Z-buffer then the cost is 3 cycles,

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:12.782
read the old z-def value, write the new Z-def value and then write the new

00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:16.361
color. We call the new value coming in the source and the old value the

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:20.835
destination. When the object is farther away, only 1 cycle is needed. We'll

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:24.358
always have the cost of leaving the destination of reading the Z-Buffer depth.

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:28.268
When we compare the source to the destination, we get 3 cycles due to this path

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:32.021
of having to actually replace the old color with the new color. And the old

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:35.575
depth with the new depth. However, if we have the case where the source is

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:39.824
greater than the destination, we're done. The object's hidden, and we don't have

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:43.804
to do any further processing. So we only need 1 cycle. So let's look at the

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:47.630
answers in reverse order. Back to front order, in fact, is the worst case

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.110
possible. Since each object in turn is the closest object so far. So all values

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.798
read in the z buffer will also be written. Randomizing might help avoid worst

00:00:55.798 --> 00:00:59.376
case behavior, but it's not the fastest way. Largest to smallest has no

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:03.002
predictable effect as the testing process is happening per pixel. So size

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.911
doesn't really matter. So this first answer is the correct one. Roughly sorting

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:11.195
and drawing objects from front to back is indeed a way in which applications

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.760
optimize GTU performance.
