00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.912
I have my axis of rotation. It's negative X, Z. It's a good idea to normalize

00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:09.006
this, but this will do for now. If I look at my cube, it's pretty easy to figure

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:13.080
out the diagonal directions themselves. Here is the easiest one. It goes from

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.850
negative one, negative one, negative one to one, one, one. So the cylinder's

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.139
axis is (2,2,2). We can also this vector's length to find the distance from one

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:26.298
corner to another. These are the facts we need to continue. We've got the axis

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:30.773
of rotation. We need the angle to rotate and the length of the cylinder itself.

00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:35.960
Here's three JS code that computes the cylinder's length. Three JS uses a class

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.160
called Vector3. What you put in a vector 3 a point or a vectors coordinate is up

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.826
to you. Perhaps a better name might have been coordinate 3 but that' pretty

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:48.578
bulky most graphic systems you'll encounter will call coordinates vectors but

00:00:48.578 --> 00:00:52.138
it's easy enough to understand from the context what is meant. To find the

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:55.920
cylinders axis direction and length I set up the 2 corner locations I then

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.591
subtract one vector from the other using the sub vectors method. Giving a vector

00:01:00.591 --> 00:01:04.441
from one point to another. There are a huge number of vector and matrix

00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:09.073
operations supported in 3JS, subtraction is just one of many. Once we have the

00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:12.977
cylinder axis, this last line of code computes the length of this axis, which

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:17.219
we'll need for knowing how long to make the cylinder. At this point, we have the

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.428
axis of rotation The length of the cylinder, but we don't have the angle of

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:25.132
rotation yet. However, we have everything we need to get it. Given this

00:01:25.132 --> 00:01:29.968
cylinder's access, we can dot product it with the y axis, which is where the

00:01:29.968 --> 00:01:34.414
cylinder starts at, and then, by the dot product of that and its final

00:01:34.414 --> 00:01:39.772
position... We will get the angle that we need to rotate. Remember that the dot

00:01:39.772 --> 00:01:43.428
product computes the cosine of the angle between two normalized vectors. So we

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:48.279
normalize the cylinder's axis here and takes its dot product with the y axis

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:52.708
vector here. This gives us the cosine of the angle. So we take the arc cosine to

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:57.526
get the angle back in radiants. Using a dot product is a bit of overkill, by the

00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:01.964
way. Computing a dot product with a y axis like this is the same as just

00:02:01.964 --> 00:02:06.502
grabbing the y component of the cylAxis. We could've simply normalized and done

00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:10.264
this like this code here. However, unless this is a critical loop, like we're

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:14.748
making a billion of these ornaments, I'd recommend using this first way. If

00:02:14.748 --> 00:02:18.465
someone reads or modifies this code in the future, the intent is clearer and

00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:22.240
more general. Now we have all the facts we need to make this object, the axis

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.415
and angle of rotation and the length of the cylinder. So let's get cracking.

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:29.442
Well, I guess I should mention that the sign of the theta might be a little bit

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:32.676
questionable here. We could use the right had rule to make sure we have the

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:37.546
direction of rotation right. Or we could use the principle of negate and try

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:42.164
again. I learned about this practice long ago from an article in an old trade

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:46.458
journal called SGI Insider. It was great to realize that someone else was doing

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:50.535
what I also do. If I put a rotation in and it goes the wrong direction, just try

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:54.832
the opposite. So feel free to do the same, as you're in good company. You could

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:58.608
spend 15 minutes trying to figure out the sign needed after some set of matrix

00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:02.302
operations, and still have about a 50 percent chance of getting it right.

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:06.954
Faster, more reliable is just to try it and see. That said, this practice won't

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:10.671
help much if there are too many things to negate or if the rotation is part of a

00:03:10.671 --> 00:03:14.815
long chain of transforms. Or if you're starting from an incorrect algorithm.

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:19.111
But, if you're feeling the math is solid, go ahead and just do it. Using this

00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:22.946
principle with my test program, I found I needed to negate the angle to move the

00:03:22.946 --> 00:03:26.456
rod to the correct place. I guess I could've thought it through and realized

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.848
this is the right-hand rule, and all that kind of stuff, but nonetheless, just

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:34.028
trying it made me realize we need to. To have a negative theta. I don't really

00:03:34.028 --> 00:03:38.444
like negative angles, I like to think positively, so I negated both the angle

00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:42.430
and the axis direction. This should give exactly the same rotation. If you

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.470
rotate clockwise around one axis, rotating counter clockwise around the opposite

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.563
axis' direction is the same thing.
