00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
As with any devil's guide, you should of course not do what's in here,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but you should do the exact opposite.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This means you should go and fix the problem not the symptom,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
understand what your program should do, and finally to proceed systematically.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let me come up with a quiz here--before you apply fix, what is it you should do--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
understand what the problem is, understand what the code should do, or/and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
be able to predict how the fix would address the problem.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Over to you.
