00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.390
Now to play audio, we have to go beyond UIKit and

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.880
think about another framework called AVFoundation.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.710
Let me bring that out.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.703
AV stands for Audio Visual.

00:00:12.703 --> 00:00:15.346
And there is a library inside this framework,

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:17.910
that we will use to play this audio.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.980
&gt;&gt; My mom always said, life was like a box of chocolate.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.820
&gt;&gt; So what I have done here, is I've added links to the instructor notes

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.550
that will list out all the classes that are inside AV Foundation.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.418
We are going to use one of them to play the audio you just heard.

00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:38.890
Your job is to figure out which class we should use to play audio from a file.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.840
So go ahead and read the documentation, and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.630
then type in the name of the class that can help us play audio from a file.
