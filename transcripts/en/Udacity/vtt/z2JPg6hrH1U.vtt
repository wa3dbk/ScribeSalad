00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.850
Well, the answer isn't because this would be too easy there

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.980
really is a good reason for why you don't want to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.850
set viewport width to a fixed size. Namely that then your

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.680
site would scale the same layout across all devices, you'd get

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.130
the same layout of text and images on a four inch

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.700
cell phone as you do on a ten inch tablet. And

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.650
of course this means the fonts would be are consistent size

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.384
with that layout. You'd get the same size fonts rescaled on

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:29.150
to a four inch phone as you would on a ten inch tablet.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.160
And fundamentally this would result in

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.960
a poor user experience across mobile devices.
