00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.760
So, let's go one step further past the decorator pattern that we

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.180
built up just now.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.940
Since the object we are decorating is a brand new empty object, it

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.730
kind of seems like we could just ask the carlike function to just build it for

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.850
us in the first place.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.490
That is where classes come in.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.110
The only difference between the decorator code that you see here and

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.600
a class is that a class builds the object that it's going to augment,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.190
whereas a decorator accepts the object it's going to augment as an input.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.800
So if we move the object creation into the carlike function and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.450
remove the obj function parameter in favor of declaring a local variable,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.590
then we would have what's known as a class, and

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.710
we would give it a different sort of name to reflect that fact.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.190
So a class is a construct that is capable of building a fleet of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.970
similar objects that all conform to roughly the same interface.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.580
It's conventional to name your class with a capitalized noun,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.780
almost like a proper noun for a category of things.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.820
The functions that produce these fleets of similar objects are called

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.090
Constructor Functions.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.790
Because their job is to construct the objects that will qualify as members of

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.910
the class.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.830
So to recap, the class is the notion of a category of things that you'd like to

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.805
build and all of the entailed code that supports that category.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:20.170
Whereas the constructor is simply the function that you use to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.620
produce a new instance of that class.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.100
The objects that get returned from these constructor function invocations,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.460
those are called instances, instances of the class.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.470
So when we call a Constructor Function in order to create an instance,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.440
that operation is known as Instantiating.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.470
At this point, we've reached an example of the functional class pattern

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.060
because we have a simple function that produces instances of the Car class.
