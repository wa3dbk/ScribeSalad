00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is one per card wouldn't be enough, and in any case,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the number of cards is really irrelevant.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What's important is the number of possible hands

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the number of possible results we get for each type of hand,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the rankings we get for each.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
One per card doesn't make sense. 1,000 per card doesn't really help that much.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now we're talking.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So here we say at least expect to get 10 possible results for the least common rank,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so least common is the straight flush, and if we said

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
if we expect to get 10 straight flushes,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
then probably we're not going to get exactly 10,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but it's not going to be off by that much.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If we expected only to get one straight flush,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
then maybe half the time we'd get zero, and half the time

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we'd get 2, and that would be off by a lot.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That wouldn't be very good, but 10 seems about right.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
At least we're in the right ballpark.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If that's the right answer here, then what does that translate over here?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, we can just look up the probability.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We had that on the previous page.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Look up the probability.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's about 1 in 60,000 or 66,000,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and so if we have a little bit more than 10 of each,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
then that comes up to 700,000,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and that's a lot less than 52 factorial, which is the total number

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of permutations of the hands.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Actually, permutations isn't that important.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
A better number would be the total number of combinations.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But even the total number of combinations is bigger than 700,000,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so we're probably okay going here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And here's the code to calculate the hand percentages.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I give a default value for n, the number of deals that we're going to do,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the default of 700,000, but you can put in as many as you want.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And I should say don't try to run this function here

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
with 700,000 as the input because it will take too long.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It should take 20 or 30 seconds,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and running on our servers, we don't let you run that long,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so if you want to run it here, put in a smaller value for n,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
say 1,000 or so, or if you want to run it on your own home machine,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
you're welcome to go ahead and do that.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We make up a vector of counts which starts with no count

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
for each of the 9 possibilities, and then we go through

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the deals, and what I'm going to do is deal 10 hands

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and over 10 times, and for each of those hands,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I compute the ranking and then increment the count for the ranking,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and then I just print out the results.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
When I hit Run, here's what the results look like.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And if I want to compare them to what we got from Wikipedia,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I can go ahead and do that.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Here you can see we have 2 columns.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
These are the results as computed by our random sampling,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and these are the results as computed by exact math

00:02:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
as shown in Wikipedia, and you can see they're pretty close in all cases.
