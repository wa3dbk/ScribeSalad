00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right, this review quiz is about precedence and associativity.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Over here on the left, I've written out a grammar for list,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and list selections in Python, which is kind of cool.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
An expression can be a list of integers separated by commas.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You can have as many integers as you want, and let's imagine there is some other rule

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
where int goes to [1, 2, 3] and we have tokens for that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You can take the length of the list, or if you're given a list,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you can select off all but the last element.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If you have the list [1, 2, 3], then you just get the list [1, 2].

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now I tell you as part of this problem that "len" associates to the "right" and it has low precedence,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and selecting off all but the last element associates to the left and has high precedence.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Just like we may have told you before that multiplication has high precedence,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and addition has lower precedence.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Then the input here is I want to compute the length of [1, 2, 3] with the last element selected off.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The last element selected off. And then down here, I've parenthesized that input two different ways.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What I want you to do is check the box that corresponds to what are parse 3 looks like.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If we were to put this associativity and precedence declaration into our parser with this grammar,

00:01:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which one of these worlds would we end up in?
