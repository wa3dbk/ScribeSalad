00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.225
We're not just going to learn about absolute value. We'll also going to learn

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:08.800
about their equations and inequalities. We learn that the absolute value of a

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:13.155
number represents the distance from zero. So, the distance of some unknown

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:17.725
number must be 7. Well, I can't be 7 units away on my current number line, let's

00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:22.366
extend it. This means that variable d could be 7 units to the left of 0, or 7

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:26.660
units to the right of zero. The Algebra tells us that d could be at negative 7,

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.140
or d could be at positive 7. This is why when we solve absolute value equations,

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.744
you'll often see us split it into two equations, one with a positive answer, and

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:40.112
one with a negative. Because remember, our distance from zero could be to the

00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:44.919
right or to the left. The negative represents the left. But keep in mind, this

00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:49.952
distance is still positive. Only the value of d or the location, is negative.
