00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.020
Finally, we're going to talk about structural patterns.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.870
And this is a very pragmatic pattern to discuss

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.440
honestly because it's a pattern you use if you're

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.630
ever migrating data, from relational data base management systems,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.030
to a Hadoop system. And what you do

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.370
with this pattern, is taking advantage of the fact

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.040
that Hadoop, doesn't care what format your data is

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.120
in, which means you can take advantage of hierarchical

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.540
data, which will allow you to avoid doing

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.670
live joins and several data sets at the time

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.920
of analysis. So if you know a kind of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100
information you're going to want to get later you can

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.330
save a lot of time by reformatting your data. Now in order to

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.212
use this pattern, your data sources must be linked by some

00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:50.490
foreign keys, and the data must be structured and row based,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.020
and in fact this pattern in the book of [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.490
design pattern is actually they refer to as structured hierarchical pattern.
