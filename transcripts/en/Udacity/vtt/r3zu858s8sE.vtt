00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To study what's going wrong when trying to solve stiff differential equations numerically,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we'll typically looks at this type problem of very simple differential equation

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which by the way is not stiff but serves to help us understand what's happening here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The derivative of x with respect to time should minus a constant times x itself.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This constant is supposed to be a positive number that's called Dahlquist' test equation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and it's easy to figure out what the solution should be.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The rate of change is proportional to the current value with the negative proportionality constant.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This means that per time step, we are losing a specific percentage of the current value.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If we start here, we lose that specific percentage and lose that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
particular percentage and again and again and again.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is exponential decay, so we know that as t goes to infinity, any solution will approach 0.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This decay to 0 takes place regardless of the value of k.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
As long as k is positive and this proportionality constant,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
any solution is going to decay to 0 regardless of the value of k.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If k is larger, this decay is faster. If k is smaller, this decay is slower.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And of course, we want that our numerical solution has the same behavior

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
when we simulate this equation in the computer, we want to see the decay to 0.

00:01:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Technical term here is stability. How small does the step size have to be for the solver to stay stable?
