00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.540
Even though technically Objective-C
is a statically typed language,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.010
it sneaks in more flexibility in
typing through the use of the type ID.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.870
ID as you'll remember is like
saying to be determined or

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.210
this object can be of any type.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.460
At runtime a more specific
type is determined.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.290
Delegates generally have type ID as
well as objects inside of arrays.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.500
When Swift is consuming
Objective-C code,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.280
objects of type id are given
the type any object.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.240
An object of type any object
can hold a variety of types.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.670
Although your code may work if
you allow objects of type ID

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.150
to be imported as objects of type any
object., it's not really in the spirit

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.900
of Swift development to allow for
such flexible types.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.020
Not to mention,
any object can leave you vulnerable to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.460
unrecognized selector errors when
you're dealing with untyped arrays.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.900
Let's take a look at an example.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.730
Here's a Backpack class
written in Objective- C.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.260
And you can see it has a property called
Keys which holds an NSMutableArray.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.100
This example project also has a class
called Key which implements the method

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.800
openDoor.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.320
Here's some Swift Code that's
using the Backpack class.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.550
First, we instantiate
a Backpack instantiated

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.390
Key to represent her house key and
then add that key to the backpack.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.690
So far so good, now let's take
the Key out of the Backpack and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.470
try to open the door.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.570
The code above compiles fine but
when we press run we've got a problem.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.140
So, let's go down to the console and
see if we can see what's going on.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.075
We have to scroll up to the top.

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:43.030
Okay,what have we got.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.060
Unrecognized selectors sent to
instants and a bunch of numbers.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.350
What's this about a string.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.460
If we look again at
the Backpack class we can see

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.570
the first object in
the array as an API key.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.451
So, it doesn't implement
the method openDoor.

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:04.570
OpenDoor is the unrecognized selector.
