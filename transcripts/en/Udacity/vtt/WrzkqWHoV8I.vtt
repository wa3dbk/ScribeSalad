Here are the classes that I found. Person, we know about that one. String and

00:00:05.098 --> 00:00:10.146
Array List, I'm not worried about those, many classes use them. System right

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:14.741
here, where we have system.out. And Print Stream, that's a hard one actually,

00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:20.002
because the print stream class is never mentioned explicitly. One would just

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:25.804
have to know that system.out is an object off the print stream class. Now, I am

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:29.772
a bit bothered about that dependency, because it means that the car class can

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:33.678
only work in an environment where I actually have a console, that would mean

00:00:33.678 --> 00:00:39.998
any computer. And these days, does your cell phone have a console, does a

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:45.515
toaster oven? I don't really like to build on a dependency on system.out and

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.670
print stream if I can avoid it.
