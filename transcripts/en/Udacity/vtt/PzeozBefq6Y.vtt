00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.250
We divide our polynomial by 2x, which means we really divide each term by 2x.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.546
The first three terms would stay the same, because that's the same division we

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:13.015
performed earlier. For the last term, however, we have 4 divided by 2, which is

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:17.424
positive 2 divided by an x and x is in the denominator. You might have written

00:00:17.424 --> 00:00:21.916
this as your answer, which is correct as well. A negative exponent moves the

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:26.884
base from the numerator to the denominator. And just like before, if we wanted

00:00:26.884 --> 00:00:31.889
to check, we can multiply this entire polynomial by positive 2x, and we'll get

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:33.202
this as our answer.
