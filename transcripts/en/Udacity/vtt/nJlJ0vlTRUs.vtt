00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.684
t distributions are defined by their degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom are

00:00:04.684 --> 00:00:08.475
pretty complicated to explain. So, first we'll start with some real life

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:13.120
examples before applying them to these statistical concepts. Let's say you have

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.501
three homework assignments to do, writing, statistics, and psychology. And each

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:22.826
will take you an hour. And you only have three hours to finish them. So here

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:27.230
are your three, hour long, time slots. How many options do you have for which

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.410
homework assignment, you can do for the first time slot? After you choose which

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.630
homework assignment you'll do. How many options do you have for the second time

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.608
slot? And finally, how many options do you have for the third? After you choose

00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:43.343
what homework assignments you'll do for your first two time slots?
