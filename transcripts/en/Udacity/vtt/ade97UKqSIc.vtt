00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.350
I have a new, challenging programming assignment for you that will take you a while,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.823
but I would like you to implement a multidimensional Kalman filter for the example

00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:13.930
I've just given you.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.181
The matrix class is a class for manipulating matrices that should make it really easy.

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:26.064
It has a function that initializes matrices--I'll show you an example in a second.

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.861
It can set them down to 0.

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.130
It can compute an identity matrix.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.207
It can print out a matrix with show.

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:38.170
It overloads operators like addition, subtraction,

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:45.292
multiplication, and even computes the transpose of a matrix,

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:49.291
and in some more extended code, it can actually invert a matrix

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.249
using Cholesky factorization.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.671
There's a function here called inverse.

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.131
This matrix class is available.

00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:59.492
It's a small version of what is found in typical libraries.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.121
I want to demonstrate it for you just for a second.

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:08.202
You can make a matrix with a command like this with the argument in the parenthesis.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.347
It's a 2-dimensional matrix.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.328
In this case it's a vertical vector.

00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:17.041
With the show command, you can print out the result of the vertical vector.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.346
You can put the transpose as follows.

00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:23.779
If you run this, you'll find the horizontal vector.

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:27.353
Say you wish to multiply a matrix by a vector,

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:31.253
then we can make a 2 x 2 matrix with this initialization over here,

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:33.953
a matrix of [12., 8.] and [6., 2.].

00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:35.983
We can print this matrix.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.688
Here it is: 12, 8, 6, 2.

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.591
These are these values over here.

00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:42.986
And it can multiply F and a.

00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:45.538
So here b = F * a.

00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:50.155
And if we show the result, we get the vector 200 and 80.

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:56.319
That's obtained by 10 x 12 + 10 x 8 is 200.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.232
10 x 6 + 10 x 2 is 80.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:06.040
So using my matrix libraries, I set an initial state.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.038
This is a tracking in 1D where the state is the position

00:02:11.038 --> 00:02:12.819
and the velocity.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.485
I initialized both with 0 because I don't know the actual location and the velocity.

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:20.178
I give an uncertainty matrix

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:23.106
where I have a really high uncertainty in the position

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:26.827
and a really high uncertainty in the velocity,

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:28.177
and they're both uncorrelated.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:31.298
That's the matrix of 1000, 0, 0, 1000.

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:34.857
I specify an external motion, but it's 0, 0, so it has no effect,

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:35.891
so just ignore this.

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:40.331
I build the next state function, which is the one we just discussed,

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:42.075
[1., 1] [0, 1.].

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:47.046
That assumes that the velocity is just being added to the position,

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:50.205
and the velocity and expectation stays the same.

00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:53.563
I build a measurement function that extracts just the first

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.491
of the 2 values, 1 and 0,

00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:58.479
so I can observe the location but not the velocity.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.335
I have a measurement uncertainty.

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:02.262
It happens to be 1 in this example.

00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:05.603
And I have an identity matrix, [1., 0.] [0., 1.].

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:09.406
And then I run a filter with these 3 measurements over here,

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:12.542
and what should come out is that by running the filter,

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:15.305
I can estimate the velocity

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:18.151
and therefore make better predictions.

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:20.676
In the filter that I want you to program,

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:25.775
I want the measurement update first and then the motion update.

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:28.438
Every time we run the filter,

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:33.058
I want you to update the measurement first, then the motion.

00:03:33.058 --> 00:03:37.387
Here is my empty procedure filter that we have to fill in

00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:39.527
where I go through our measurements,

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:42.687
and it builds the measurement update and then the motion update,

00:03:42.687 --> 00:03:46.124
the prediction, and then I just print out the resulting estimates.

00:03:46.124 --> 00:03:49.705
I do this a number of times, 3 times in this case.

00:03:49.705 --> 00:03:52.622
Once we fill this in and I hit the Run button,

00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:54.387
I get the following output.

00:03:54.387 --> 00:03:57.037
After my first measurement update,

00:03:57.037 --> 00:04:01.738
I observed the location 1, which gets copied over

00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:04.878
essentially to .99 over here.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:09.833
I learn nothing about the velocity, so it's still 0, just the way I initialized it.

00:04:09.864 --> 00:04:13.561
And then there's an updated uncertainty matrix

00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:17.636
which now shows what happens to be a strong correlation,

00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:19.765
1000, 1000, 1000, 1000.

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:22.484
That differs from the initial one only that we filled in

00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:23.924
the off-diagonal elements.

00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.942
It happens to be exactly what the Kalman filter does.

00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:29.160
And then I'll observe again the 2.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.855
I want the output to now tell me that my next prediction is 3.

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:36.338
It's the observation plus the prediction.

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:39.335
But now I have a really good estimate

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:41.787
on what the velocity is.

00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:44.796
It's essentially 1, and the reason is

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:47.432
my Kalman filter was able to use

00:04:47.432 --> 00:04:50.774
the Kalman filter equations to find this value.

00:04:50.774 --> 00:04:54.617
There's a new covariance matrix,

00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:58.272
and for the third observation followed by the prediction,

00:04:58.272 --> 00:05:02.637
the prediction is correctly effectively 4, 3.999.

00:05:02.637 --> 00:05:07.071
The velocity estimate is correctly 1, which is .99999,

00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:10.357
and I have yet another uncertainty matrix which illustrates

00:05:10.357 --> 00:05:13.375
that I have a high certainty in the velocity estimate.

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:16.124
Notice a relatively high certainty in the position estimate

00:05:16.124 --> 00:05:18.224
compared to my initial uncertainties.

00:05:18.224 --> 00:05:20.783
So can you write the the algorithm: 'filter()'

00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:25.292
that outputs those exact values over here?

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.888
This is an involved programming assignment.

00:05:27.888 --> 00:05:30.604
What you have to do is you have to essentially

00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:32.906
implement the equations I gave you.

00:05:32.906 --> 00:05:35.881
You have to familiarize yourself with the matrix class

00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:39.674
and then go and fill in the filter() code

00:05:39.674 --> 00:05:42.437
in accordance to the things that I showed you

00:05:42.437 --> 00:05:44.697
for the multivariate Kalman filter.
