00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.740
So now that we have seen that GShare can

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.490
do some qualitative branches that PShare cannot do, but on

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.940
the hand PShare can do things with shorter history that

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.620
require GShare to have more of a history. The question

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.550
is if we need to choose one, which one

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.278
should we choose in our processor? Many earlier processors would

00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:23.018
choose either GShare or PShare, but very quickly people figured

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:26.000
out. That you really want to have both of them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.670
You want to have a GShare so that you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.436
can do correlated branches. And you want to do

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:34.316
PShare because it does better figuring out those self

00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:37.290
similar branches, even if it has a shorter history.
