00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.856
As one final explanation for this lesson, let's see if there's a different

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.751
inequality we can look at that can give us this same solution set. I'm just

00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:12.041
quickly going to rewrite the original inequality that we have, and see if I can

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:16.248
modify it to simplify it a little bit. One thing I'd like you to notice, is that

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:20.409
this negative sign outside of the entire expression, is going to effectively

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:24.697
multiply either both terms in the numerator by negative 1 or multiply the entire

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:28.897
denominator by negative 1. So, we can consider this a common factor of, for

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:33.561
example, both terms in the numerator. There's one more common factor within one

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:37.957
of the quantities here, and that's 2, in the quantity 2x minus 4. Both 2x and

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:42.657
negative 4 are divisible by 2. Let's rewrite this. Because multiplication is

00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:47.577
commutative, I can move these factors around however I want. And I think what

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:52.680
I'd like to do is to write this factor of negative 1 half, as a single constant

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.848
outside of the rest of the terms multiplying that fraction. Now, we can very

00:00:57.848 --> 00:01:03.141
clearly see that there's this factor out here, this constant factor, that we can

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:08.072
just divide both sides by to get rid of. However, since we will be dividing by a

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:12.762
fraction, we can equivalently just multiply it by its reciprocal or multiply by

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:17.261
negative 2, on both sides, of course. Now, here's the kicker. Remember, that

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:21.613
since we're multiplying by a negative number on both sides, we need to switch

00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:26.360
the direction of the inequality. So now, we have this new inequality, x plus 10

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.954
over the quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x minus 2 is less than 0. And in

00:01:30.954 --> 00:01:35.754
fact, if you went through the entire process of solving for x here, you'd find

00:01:35.754 --> 00:01:40.554
that the solution set for this inequality is exactly the same as the solution

00:01:40.554 --> 00:01:45.099
set for this inequality up here. And we can tell why that's the case. These are

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.951
equivalent. We move from this one to this one using completely legal algebraic

00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:52.846
modifications. Let's see how graphs can help us understand this inequality a

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:53.818
little bit better.
