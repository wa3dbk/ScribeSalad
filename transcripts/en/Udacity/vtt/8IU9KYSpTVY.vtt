00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.840
We worked with multiplying monomials and binomials, and binomials with other

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.869
binomials, now let's try something a little bit harder. We're going to multiply

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:11.895
a binomial with a trinomial. Let's start with our simple case using numbers, and

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:15.627
then see if you can extend that to figure out something harder. Just like

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:19.653
before, we can split-up each of these numbers, so that way we can make this

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:23.943
multiplication problem more simple, I'll have 13, which is 10 plus 3, and 123,

00:00:23.943 --> 00:00:28.901
which is 100 plus 20 plus 3. Now can imagine doing this multiplication using a

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:34.091
rectangle with the appropriate side-lengths. When I find the area of each of

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:39.503
these rectangles and add them up, I get 1,599, the answer to our multiplication

00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:40.209
problem.
