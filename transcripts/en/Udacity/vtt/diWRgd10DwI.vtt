Note that web audio is still not fully supported in all browsers, it's

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:07.531
supported in web kit browsers only today and Mozilla is actively working on

00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:12.841
adding support for it in Firefox. It would be nice if we caught this and let

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.661
potential players running in those browsers know that they might have a

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.878
degraded experience. In order to do this, we need to catch any exceptions when

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:24.670
we try to initialize our sound manager class and alert the player. Go ahead and

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.691
fill in the init function shown here, catching any exceptions to the

00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.564
WebKitAudioContext initializer throws.
