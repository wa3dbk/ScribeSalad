00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.827
So you're probably saying so what? Why
would I want to reduce factors first?

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:08.367
Well, what if I wanted to find 3/10*5/12?
I could draw a diagram of the candy bar

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.433
and split up the pieces before it. I could
split up the 10's and then 12's. But

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:16.360
that's kind of a lot of work and I know I
just really need to multiply these 2

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:21.152
fractions. Multiplying these two fractions
together I get 15/120. But now

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:25.483
I have to figure out if I can simplify
this, and how to simplify this fraction.

00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:30.310
This can be frustrating working with large
numbers, so let's make our work easier and

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:34.840
simplify our fractions first. I know 10
can be written as 2*5, and 12 can be

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:40.283
written as 3*4. Remember any number
divided by itself makes 1. Like 4/4 makes

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:45.530
1, 5/5 makes 1. It doesn't work for zero,
but we should keep this in mind when we're

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:50.948
simplifying. Here I have 3/3 so that makes
1 and 5/5, so that also makes 1. Now I'll

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.609
just multiply my numerators. So I have
1 times 1, which is 1 and I have 2 times 1 times 1 times 4 or I

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.603
have 2 times 1 times 1 times 4.
Which I know that's just really 2*4 or 8.

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:08.582
So 15/120 is really the same thing as
1/8th. I am showing you this longer method

00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:12.757
so you can really see why we can cancel
factors. You can do ahead of the time and

00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:18.256
this is what it would look like. I know 5
and 10 share a common factor of 5, so I

00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:24.730
can divide them both by 5, 5/5 makes 1,
10/5 makes 2. 3 and 12 also share a factor

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:31.329
of 3, so 3/3 makes 1, and 12/3 makes 4.
Now, I multiply, just like before, 1*1 is

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:36.105
1, and 2*4 is 8. So either way I do it
this long way, or this shorter way with

00:01:36.117 --> 00:01:37.526
cross-cancelling, I get 1/8.
