00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The original question was--does she have a vertex cover of size at most k

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.039
and this first part is a different way of saying exactly that.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.140
So at most, k vertices are needed to cover all the edges.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:21.400
However, what this implies is that if there's any vertex does an endpoint to k+1 edges or more,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.100
then it must be in the cover because otherwise we would require more than k vertices

00:00:27.100 --> 99:59:59.000
to cover all the edges, which is not the same as the original question that we are asking.
