Chimpanzees cannot speak human language because they don't have the vocal

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:07.598
structure needed to speak. But we do know that humans have taught apes to learn

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:11.368
American sign language, and in doing so they've been able to communicate with

00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:17.305
humans. Researchers Alan and Beatrix Gardner for example, compiled more than

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:22.371
four hundred American sign language signs. That their three chimps have learned

00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:27.436
to use through extensive training. Another animal, Kanzi, a bonobo, which is a

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:31.157
type of ape, understands at least 3,000 English words and uses symbols to

00:00:31.157 --> 00:00:37.143
communicate with his teacher and other people. His teacher is Doctor Sue Savage

00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:41.160
Rumbagh. When Kanzi was seven years old, they compared his language

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.446
comprehension to a two and a half year old human. Both of them had 660 spoken

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:53.060
requests to see whether they were able to understand and perform the requests.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.028
And it turns out they're both able to perform the commands at about the same

00:00:57.028 --> 00:01:03.100
rate. They were both about 70% successful. Moreover, what's really fascinating

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.250
is that one study showed that five chimpanzees who knew how to sign actually

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.806
communicated with each other for quite a bit. And when they analyzed their

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:14.055
signs, they found that 88% of their conversations were about social

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:19.248
interactions. These are things such as play and reassurance. The other 12

00:01:19.248 --> 00:01:23.278
percent were about things such as grooming, talking to themselves, feeding,

00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:28.932
disciplining, and even cleaning. That's pretty amazing. Another fascinating

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:33.633
discovery was about a chimpanzee named Washoe. She actually began teaching her

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:37.984
adopted son to sign. And only eight weeks after learning sign language from his

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:42.350
adopted mother, he began to sign regularly with humans. So how cool is this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.706
stuff? I really love it. It makes me teaching my dog to bark when I say speak,

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:48.874
seems kind of mundane when these animals can learn actually how to communicate

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:53.621
using sign language. There's a lot of other studies like this. So we'll post

00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:55.958
some links in the instructors notes box for you to check out if you're

00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.040
interested in it. So the moral of the story is that yes, for some animals they

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.670
can learn to communicate using human language, however not at the level you and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.394
I speak. So let's go to Susan to introduce our last area that we're going to

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.280
discuss about language.
