00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.310
The apt get application is your main
interface to a ton of package related

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.600
functionality.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.590
We can check out everything you
can do by reading the man page for

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.260
it with this command, man apt get.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.520
We see here it can install packages,
it can even remove packages,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.640
it can do all sorts of stuff.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.400
For now, let's see if there
are some packages that are no

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.470
longer required that we can
just automatically remove.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.920
We'll do this with the command
apt-get autoremove.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.000
And once again, it's an administrative
task that has to be run as root.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.620
So we use sudo.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.610
After a few seconds,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.100
we're returned back to our prompt to
let us know everything is all done.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.200
Now let's use apt-get to
install new software.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.690
We'll install an application
called finger.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.850
It's something we'll use a little bit
later on when working with users.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.755
We do this by typing the command
apt-get install finger, and

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.263
once again using sudo.
