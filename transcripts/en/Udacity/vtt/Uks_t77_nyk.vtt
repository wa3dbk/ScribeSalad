00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.420
That brings us to a discussion of procedural

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.290
design versus an object-based design. You're all familiar,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.150
I'm sure, with procedural design where you're writing

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.990
your code as one monolithic entity, and in a

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.190
procedural world, you have shared state in terms

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.370
of global variables, and you may have private

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.040
state in the caller and the callee. And

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.702
state is now distributed all over the place. So,

00:00:24.702 --> 00:00:27.762
basically, the interface between the caller and the

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:31.162
callee is through the normal procedure call mechanism that

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:33.814
one sub-system may make a procedure call that

00:00:33.814 --> 00:00:37.702
goes into another subsystem. And this is how monolithic

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:40.942
kernels are built where state is now strewn

00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:44.445
all over the place. There maybe some shared state

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:46.857
and private state of subsystems and so on,

00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:50.790
and this is typically how monolithic systems are built.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.860
To contrast this procedural design to object-based

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.600
design, in an object-based design, objects contain the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.570
state that is entirely contained within this

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.880
object, not visible outside. And there are methods

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.980
that are inside those object that manipulate

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.360
the state that is part of this object.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.950
So in other words, externally, the state is

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.190
not visible. The only thing that is visible

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.160
are the methods for invocation and these invocations

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.090
work on the state that is local to the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.010
object. So what you get with an object-based

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.510
design is strong interfaces and complete isolation of the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.090
state of an object from everything else. Contrast

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.530
that with the procedural design, where the state can

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.750
be strewn all over the place, and the

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.210
shared state can be manipulated from several different subsystems

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.780
that are part of a big monolith. But in this case, what we have is, strong

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.290
interfaces that completely separate one object from other

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.530
objects. And the state that is specific to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.690
an object is contained entirely inside this object,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.625
invisible to other objects outside except via well-defined

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.030
invocation methods. That have been exposed by this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.764
object implementor to the outside world. As OS designers,

00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:09.449
the immediate question that might come up is,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.280
well, if we have these strong interfaces, it sounds

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.760
similar to what we discussed when we talked about

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.870
the structure of operating systems early on, and that

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.530
is border corssing across protection domains. Is it going to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.190
cost us? But, there are ways around it. To

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.400
make these border crossing performance conscious as well. Now,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.640
where to apply this object orientation? Well, in Spring,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.940
for instance, they applied object orientation in building

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.650
the operating system kernel. So the key point

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.300
to take away is, if object orientation is

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.090
good at the level of implementing a high performance

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.770
operating system kernel, it should be good at

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.310
higher levels of the software as well. And while

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.130
I am expounding the virtues of object-based design

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.650
here, we have already seen this when we talked

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.910
about Tornado system. That was also using

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.940
an object-based approach to building operating system kernels.
