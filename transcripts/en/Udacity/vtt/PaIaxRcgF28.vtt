00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now let's look at the problem another way,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
in reverse.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Suppose this time that I give you

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the encoding of the finite-state machine.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I give you the accepting states, just 6, and also all of the edges.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What I would like you to do is provide me with not 1

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but 2 strings that are accepted by this finite-state machine,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
starting in state 1, but they have to be different,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so apply all of your knowledge, but trace it in reverse.

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What would a string have to be in order to get to state 6?
