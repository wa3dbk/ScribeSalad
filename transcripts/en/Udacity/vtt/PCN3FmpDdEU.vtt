00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.290
There are four major learning goals for this class. First, you'll learn about

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.930
the core methods of knowledge-based AI. These methods include schemes for

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.190
structured knowledge representation, methods for memory organization,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.880
methods for reasoning, methods for learning, [UNKNOWN] architectures as well as

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.910
methods for meta reasoning. Meta reasoning is reasoning about reasoning. Second,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.300
you learn about some of the common tasks addressed by knowledge-based AI,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.350
such as classification, understanding, planning, explanation, diagnosis,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.470
and design. Third, you will learn ways AI agents can use these

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.470
methods to address these tasks. Fourth, you learn the relationship between

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.080
the knowledge-based AI cognitive science. Using theories of

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.980
human cognition to inspire their design of human level, human-like AI and

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.140
using AI techniques to generate testable hypothesis about human cognition.
