00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.310
Use case diagrams will have two major icons. One are some stick figures and

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.100
these denote external actors. Typically, these are system users, but they

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.110
may also stand for other systems or external devices. In the use case diagram,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.984
ovals are use cases. That is, this is, a use case diagram is not a system story.

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:27.300
It's a description of the set of system stories. Lines in the diagram

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.890
without annotations indicate participation. That means that the actor at one end

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.814
is involved in the use case oval at the other end. There're two

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:42.530
annotations available in use case diagrams. One is the extends annotation and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.056
the other is the uses annotation. Extends mean that you have one story and

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:53.968
you'd like to extend it by some other contingencies, essentially getting two for

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:59.890
the price of one. The uses stereotype is like a subroutine or, or function call.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.209
That is, a common piece of behavior that might used by several other use cases.
