00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:04.110
We just saw that in computer science, you might write a function like this.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.380
First we name the function, in this case we named our function decrease by 3.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.538
Then we create a spot for the input, which we call x and put it in parentheses,

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:17.194
and then we define what the output is going to be with this return statement.

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:22.353
And then we write the output right here, x minus 3. But as you've probably come

00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:26.684
to realize over the course of this class, some people who do math a lot are a

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:31.579
little bit lazier, like me. For one thing, in math, the name of the function is

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.435
not usually nearly as inventive as it is in computer science. We can see that a

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:40.659
programmer would call a function something like this, decrease by three, that

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.634
really describes what the function's doing. In math though, our names for

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:49.250
functions are really simple. In fact, the most common one is probably just the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.269
letter f. What programmers and mathematicians do in common however, is that they

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.100
still use the parentheses around what's going to be the input for the function.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.340
And of course, x does seem like a pretty great input. Now the programmer has a

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.092
return statement, that represents what the output of this function's going to

00:01:08.092 --> 00:01:12.634
be, only around the program. But in math, we just create an equation. So if we

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:18.202
want to create the decrease by three equation in math instead, we just write f

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:22.852
of x equals x minus 3. The output is just that expression that we've often seen

00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:26.944
written to describe the deep ended variable, showing how it depends on the

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:31.568
independent variable. Now the way that we read the left hand side of this

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:36.713
equation right here is we say f of x. Now again, just like in programming, the

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:41.987
parentheses here around the input do not mean multiplication. So the output of

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:46.648
the function, the thing that's just equal to x minus 3, is this f of x over

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:50.989
here. And remember we used to say that the output was y, if the input was x. So,

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:56.684
what we're really doing in functions is replacing the independent variable, y,

00:01:56.684 --> 00:02:01.480
with this new way of writing it, f of x. I think you'll see over time why this

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.676
is a useful way of writing it. But it doesn't make the original way we learned

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:08.948
any less valid. They're just different ways of expressing pretty similar things,

00:02:08.948 --> 00:02:12.646
assuming that this is a function. Now that you've seen how both computer science

00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:16.738
and mathematics would represent the same function in different ways, I'd like

00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:20.706
you to translate the first function that we talked about from Python into its

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:24.670
mathematical form. So this is the function that we initially called Increase By

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.876
Two. I'd like the input to be x, and the output to be x plus two. I'd also like

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:34.910
you to name the function f. So just like we did up here, write the mathematical

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.703
form of the function down in this red box.
