00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.140
So if the learning goal of this class is
that you would know enough to contribute

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.020
to the educational technology community,
what's the learning outcome?

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.330
A learning outcome is
something demonstrable.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.330
A learning goal is something you
should know by the end of the course.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.060
A learning outcome is something
you should be able to do.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.300
And here the learning outcome is
a subtle twist on that learning goal.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.450
If the goal is to know
enough to contribute,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.210
the outcome is that you will
have actually contributed.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.050
Now of course the way you contribute
is dependent on your interests or

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.280
your passions in this class.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.040
For example, if you're more interested
in designing educational technology,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.040
then your contribution and your learning
outcome will be that you have actually

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.230
designed educational technology.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.630
If you're interested more
on the research side,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.450
then by the end of this course your
outcome will be you have done research.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.600
You have actually participated in
researching educational technology and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.670
made a contribution to
the research community.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.550
So depending on your interests, the
nature of your learning outcomes will

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.290
differ, but the overall outcome
is the same for everybody.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.410
By the end of this class,
you should be able to, and in fact,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.710
you will have contributed to
the educational technology community.
