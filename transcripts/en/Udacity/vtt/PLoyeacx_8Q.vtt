We said earlier that the cost to make 92 glasses wiper sets is going to depend

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.886
on the cost to make one wiper set, which is choice a, and also the number of

00:00:07.898 --> 00:00:11.806
wiper sets total that are made, choice c. So, I know that a and c are going to

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:15.765
be the letters that go in these boxes, but I need to think about the operator

00:00:15.777 --> 00:00:19.838
that I want between them before I can decide which one goes in the first box and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.044
which one in the second. Or, if that order matters at all. In previous lessons,

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:27.916
we thought about how total money spent is equal to the money spent per unit

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.284
times the number of units that are being made. So, if we want to make two

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:35.125
glasses wipers instead of one, we're going to pay twice as much money. If you

00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:38.468
wanted to make three wipers sets, we're going to spend three times as much

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.685
money, and so on and so forth. So, we need to multiply these two quantities, a

00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:46.710
and c, together. I'm going to go ahead and fill in a multiplication sign in this

00:00:46.722 --> 00:00:50.640
box. We learned earlier from the commutative property of multiplication that

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:54.730
when we're multiplying two things together, order doesn't matter. So, it doesn't

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:58.410
matter if I have a or c in this box, or a or c in this box. As long as I have

00:00:58.422 --> 00:01:01.095
one in one spot and one in the other, we are good to go.
