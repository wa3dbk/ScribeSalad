00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.010
In the next few minutes, I'm going to throw a couple more vocabulary words into

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.760
our mix. First I want to talk about a special kind of expression. In fact,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.080
the kind that we've seen most up to this time.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.405
These are polynomials. A polynomial is an expression, made up of constants,

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:20.017
variables, or both, that are combined using addition, subtraction, or

00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:23.228
multiplication. So this basically means that we have one or

00:00:23.228 --> 00:00:26.457
more terms, like we've talked about before, added together.

00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:32.020
The variables in a polynomial also have to have non-negative integer exponents.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.265
So as an example of a polynomial, we might have something like 5 x cubed minus

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:42.844
one-half x y plus 7. Or maybe z plus 6 z squared, minus 7 plus 9 x cubed,

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:47.430
plus 8 x to the 5th. So, some polynomials that we see will have more than one

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.810
variable in them, like these two right here. But often times, we'll also see

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.482
polynomials that have just one variable involved, or maybe even none. So,

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:59.411
an example of that might be something like 4 n cubed plus 3 n squared plus 1.

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:04.004
But again, any combination of constants in variables using these operators, and

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.900
only these kind of exponents, makes a polynomial.
