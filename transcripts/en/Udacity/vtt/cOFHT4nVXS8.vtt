00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.929
2 to the 6 times 3 is correct. Great work if you got it right. This would be the

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:11.596
factor tree for a 192. Notice each time we're dividing our numbers by two. We

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:16.085
have two to the six and one, three. So two to the six times three would be the

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:17.620
prime factorization.
