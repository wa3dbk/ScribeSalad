00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.820
When we check negative 1, we'll get 2 on the left and negative 2 on the right.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.183
This is not a true statement, so we know that x equals negative 1 is not

00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:14.120
going to be part of our final solution. For x equals 5, we'll get 4 on the left

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.902
and positive 4 on the right, so, yes, this answer does check and will stay as

00:00:17.902 --> 00:00:21.390
part of our final solution set.
