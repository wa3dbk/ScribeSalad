00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now it's time for the first quiz about mutation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In a previous quiz, we defined the variable stooges

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to hold 3 strings, strings Moe, Larry and Curly.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But in some of the Stooges films,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Curly was replaced by Shemp,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so your goal for this quiz is to write 1 line of code

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that changes the value of stooges to be the list containing 3 strings,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Moe, Larry, and Shemp,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but doesn't create any new list object.
