I mentioned a bit earlier that our pixel data is

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.920
stored in one large list without any real separation between pixels.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.400
If we know how many components are in each pixel,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.850
we can use that data to figure out the number of pixels stored in the array.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.720
Once we have that number we can change the appropriate pixel component.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.630
The tricky part is you can't just set the green element.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.200
You also have to set the alpha channel to a non zero value as well.
