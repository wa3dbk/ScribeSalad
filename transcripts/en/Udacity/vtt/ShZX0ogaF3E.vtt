00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.586
&gt;&gt; First, probably the most important thing, is that we actually quarry whether

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:07.173
or not all the images have been loaded. If we don't do this little step, where

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:10.757
we query this.fullyLoaded, then what's going to happen is you can go through

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:14.397
your draw function trying to draw image data that hasn't actually been loaded

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:18.323
into memory. Of course, you'll just see nothing on the screen but it's generally

00:00:18.323 --> 00:00:21.907
a good practice to let the entire thing load before you try to start working on

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:25.574
it. Next, we actually loop through all of the layers. And for each one,

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:29.077
determine whether or not it's actually a tile layer. Remember, we can actually

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:32.539
get object layers from the tiled setup. So, we need to make sure that we're only

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.133
rendering tile layers. From there, we actually create a convenient handle to the

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.667
data array. And then we walk through all the tile IDs inside of that data array.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:43.065
If it equals zero, we go ahead and continue on because no tile needs to be drawn

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:46.484
there. If it's not zero, we go ahead and grab the packet information for this

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:46.790
tile.
