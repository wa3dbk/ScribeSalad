00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.360
When thinking about how to address the
virtualization requirements that we just

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.390
mentioned in the previous quiz,
it is fortunate to observe that

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.650
commodity hardware actually has
more than two protection levels.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.824
Looking at the architecture that's,
at least in the server space, most

00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:22.372
dominant, the x86 architecture, there
are four protection levels called rings.

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:26.494
Ring 0 has the highest privilege and
can access all of the resources and

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:30.380
execute all hardware-supported
instructions.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.600
And this is where in a, a native model,
the operating system would reside.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.840
So, when the OS is in control of all the
hardware resources, it sits in ring 0.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.410
In contrast, ring 3 has
the least level of privilege, so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.410
this is where the applications
would reside.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.540
And whenever the applications try to
perform something, some operation for

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.770
which they don't have the appropriate
privileges, then a trap would be caused,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.590
and control would be switched to the
ring 0, to the lowest privileged level.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.970
One way in which these protection levels
can be used is to put the hypervisor

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.110
now in ring 0, so that's the one that
has full control over the hardware,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.840
to leave the applications to
execute at ring 3 level, and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.320
then the operating system
would execute at ring 1 level.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.930
We'll explain how this actually
works in the following video.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.480
More recent x86 architectures also
introduce two different protection modes

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.310
called root and non-root.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.818
Within each of these modes,
the four protection levels exist, so

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:39.070
there are like two times
these protection rings.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.550
Now, when running in root mode,
all of the operations are permitted,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.570
all hardware is accessible,
all instructions can be executed.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.940
So, this is the highest privilege level.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.940
And this is,

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.080
the ring 0 of the root mode,
is where we would run the hypervisor.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.970
In contrast, in non-root mode, certain
types of operations are not permitted.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.360
So then, the guest VMs would
execute in this non-root mode.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.680
And they would have,
as they did in the native execution,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.520
their applications running in ring 3 and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.440
the operating system running
at ring 0 privilege level.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.090
Attempts by the guest operating system
to perform privileged operations

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.450
cause traps that are called VMexits.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.480
And these trigger a switch to this root
mode and pass control to the hypervisor.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.800
When the hypervisor
completes its operation,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.640
it passes control back to the virtual
machine by performing a VMentry which

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.790
switches the mode into non-root mode, to
ring 0, so that the execution continues
