It gets skinnier. When the sample size is small, the standard error is large,

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:13.833
and the sampling distribution is more spread out. When the sample size is large,

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:19.209
the standard error is smaller and the sampling distribution is narrower. So you

00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:24.211
that as n increases, we have a smaller standard error and we have a smaller

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:29.593
interval in which we're pretty sure. That the population mean lies. Remember

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:35.555
that the mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the population mean.

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:41.436
Specifically, we have to quadruple n to achieve half the measurement error.

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:47.850
Let's explore this, let's say that instead of a sample size of n, we use 4 n, so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.699
we quadruple our sample size. This is the same as sigma divided by root 4 times

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.644
root n, due to the properties of the radicals and the square root of 4 is 2. So

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:08.284
this is the same as one half. Times our original, standard error. So if we

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:14.239
quadruple n, then we have half the measurement error. This isn't particularly

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.689
important, but it's good to make a note of.
