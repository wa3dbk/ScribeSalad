00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.944
Here, I'm computing the weighted average of the red, green and blue values

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:08.448
using these funny numbers. By the way that can work, the result here is a

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:13.616
double because it involves fractional numbers. And I can't put a double into an

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:18.964
end, that's where the cast comes in. Now I have my gray value. And I stick that

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:24.490
into red, green, and blue and I'm done. let's check it out. Here is Eliza in

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.460
color and here she is in black and white like in the olden days. That's pretty

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.113
nifty and it shows the reason to worry about casts. We had a situation where we

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:40.569
had a decimal number expression that we needed to put back into an integer.
