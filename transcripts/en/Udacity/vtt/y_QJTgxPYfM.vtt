00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this problem, we are concerned with two types of energy, kinetic energy and potential energy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Kinetic energy is due to the speed that is the length of the velocity vector

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and it grows with speed in a quadratic fashion.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It contains a factor of the velocity vector of the spacecraft, length of that vector squared,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
meaning if increased the velocity by a vector of two, we are going to increase the kinetic energy

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
by a vector of four, which tells us that speeding is really dangerous.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
There was another factor in here, the mass of the spacecraft

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and then there is an additional vector of one-half.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Potential energy concerns the position of the spacecraft.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
As we move the spacecraft away from earth, we have to invest energy

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and that's going to become potential energy.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This is the distance of the spacecraft from the center of the earth.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When you fire the rockets to get it away from earth, you invest energy

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and that energy leads to a change in potential energy.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In the case of gravity, it's easiest to have potential energy be negative all of the time

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and only when the spacecraft reaches infinity, it's potential energy go to zero.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And the formula for that is pretty much related to Newton's universal law of gravity.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We've got the gravitational constant. We've got the product of the masses.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Mass of the earth, mass of the spacecraft, and in this case, divided by the first power of the distance.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If you remember in the force, we have the second power of the distance.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And of course, we have the minus sign in front if we double the distance, we go to half that original value

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but still with the minus sign and these are the only kinds of energy in our problem

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and if energy conservation holds, we know the following.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The sum of these two energies has to be a constant. It must not depend on time.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It has to stay at its initial value and that's something we can use to check our numerical solutions

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
when this expression does not stay yet its original value, we do know that we're in trouble.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Note that energy conservation does not hold in all models.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
In particular, if we have friction and all the heat produced by that friction,

00:02:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
energy won't be conserved.
