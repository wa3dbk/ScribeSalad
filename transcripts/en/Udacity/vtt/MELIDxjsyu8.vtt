00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.240
A very common problem is to find the largest element in a sequence of inputs.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.630
Now you might think, how hard can this be? In this sequence, clearly this one

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.420
is the largest. But a computer program can't scan all of the inputs at once

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.640
like we can. The computer sees items one at a time. So, let's look at this

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.263
problem a little differently. So here I have these playing cards. I get to see

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:23.870
one at a time. And I need to find out which one has the highest value. Let's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.518
look at the first one. That clearly is the largest one I've seen so far. The

00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:32.128
next one, well, that one is larger. The next one is even larger. This one here,

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:37.295
not so much, so I won't change my mind about which one is the largest. That one

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:41.760
is larger yet. This one isn't as large as the one over here,so we will ignore

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.666
it and my last one here is also smaller, so my answer is that 8 was the largest

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:51.646
input. In pseudocode the algorithm would look like this, I start at letting the

00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:57.434
largest be the first value while there are more values I read the next value.

00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:01.340
And if that value is larger than what I thought the largest was, I changed my

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.698
mind. When I'm done with this loop, largest would have been set to the very

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:09.848
largest of all the inputs. Now you get to try this out with Java code, go ahead

00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:11.900
and complete the next project.
