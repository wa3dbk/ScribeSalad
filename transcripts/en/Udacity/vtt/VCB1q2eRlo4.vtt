00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.920
We have spent sometime talking about
how to prepare data for modeling.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.700
And now we're going to shift to the fun
stuff and focus on building out models.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.620
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.690
we're going to be building out Binary
Classification Models in particular.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.800
We're going to start off by
discussing two types of models,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.082
Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:20.573
Then we're going to talk
about model comparison,

00:00:20.573 --> 00:00:23.980
which helps us figure out which of
the two models fit the data best.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.499
