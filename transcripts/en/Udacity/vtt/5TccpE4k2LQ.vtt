00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.070
Now let's do a quiz on the benefits

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.835
of branch prediction. Let's say we have the classical

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:09.290
5-stage pipeline. The fetch, decode, execute, memory and

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.287
write. The branch is fully resolved in the execute,

00:00:13.287 --> 00:00:16.239
the third stage. Fully resolved means that we

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.930
finally know the correct PC from which we should

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.300
fetch the next instruction. In this processor, we

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.720
fetch nothing until we are sure what to fetch,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.590
and we execute many many iterations of this loop. We add minus one to R1,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.880
we add R2 to itself, and then we branch if R1 is not equal zero back to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.470
the loop. The question for you what is the speed up over this achieve if we

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.420
had perfect predictor? Meaning for after every instruction

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.090
fetched we know which one should be fetched next.
