00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.300
So it seems that the recording label needs to be somewhere here on

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.920
the screen, which means that it needs to be centered horizontally and

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.660
a fixed distance away from the microphone button.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.690
Let's add these constraints to the label next.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.930
So what I'm going to do is hold down the Control key on my keyboard,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.660
click on the label, and then drag.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.510
And when I let go, I am presented with this dialogue.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.299
And I will select the Center Horizontally option here,

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:32.207
which will center my label horizontally.

00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:36.440
And then I will hold down the Control key one more time, click on the label, and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.739
then drag towards the microphone button, and then create a vertical spacing in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.480
between the button, the microphone button that is, and the label.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.660
There.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.070
Now at this point, if I open the document outline,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.180
I can see that I added a couple of new constraints here.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.320
There's the constraint for the vertical space between the microphone button and

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.330
the label, and there is the horizontal alignment for the label.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.020
Okay.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.930
Let me go ahead and close the document outline and run this project again.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.190
Aha.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.110
The label is showing up in the correct location.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.500
Although this label is showing up by default, the correct behavior would be for

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.210
this label to be hidden when the app first launches.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.020
So to fix this, I will go back to Xcode, select my label, and under

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.650
Attributes Inspector, I will scroll down to find this option called Hidden.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.300
This will make sure that my label is hidden by default.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.180
You can actually see a faint representation of it on the storyboard.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.480
Let me run this app one more time.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260
All right, the label does not show up by default.
