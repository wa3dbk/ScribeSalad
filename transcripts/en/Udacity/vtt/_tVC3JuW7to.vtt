00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.450
And the other field that will be good to transform for all of our data,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.720
is the attendance field, which is stored as a string.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.150
In this case, we transform the attendance field and

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.980
then overwrite the value on that same JavaScript object, in this case D.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.998
And then we return D, which gets passed into the function.

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:26.305
So the way to think of this, to go from our initial data file

00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:32.580
world_cup_geo.tsv to our draw callback function, which actually draws our chart.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.633
The .tsv function of D3 reads in a row of world_cup_geo.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:47.330
In this case let's say the date is a string 27-05-1934,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.100
space 1600 hours and the string, 25,000 for the attendance.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.210
It then gets passed to the transformation function.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.130
In this case, an anonymous function that doesn't have a name.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.540
We perform some transformation on that row or

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.890
JavaScript object that gets passed to it.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.170
We transform the string that represents the date

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.480
using D3's date parsing into a JavaScript date object.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.720
And also transform the string of

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.830
the attendance into an integer representation of the attendance.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.840
And then past this new object to the draw fallback.
