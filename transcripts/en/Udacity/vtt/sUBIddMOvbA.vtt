00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Alright, welcome to problem set 4; this first problem we're going to be talking

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a little bit about different kinds of search trees.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And let's go ahead and dive right in.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now let's say we have a search tree, like so, but instead of branching twice at each level,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we want to say that it's going to branch four times.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So we have a search tree more like this, where at each level, we split four times.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So that means that, since this is a search tree,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
there are four different possible paths we could go down at each different branch.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.500
Now let's also say that this tree has a height of n/3,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.000
where we're going to say that n is divisible by 3 just to keep things simpler.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So we have a whole lot of n nodes or leaves down here at the very end,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and let's just assume that there are a total of n/3 levels.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now since this is a search tree, all of these end leaves here represent

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
a different possible solution that this search tree could come to.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So my question is how many solutions does such a search tree,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.500
that splits at four times at each branch and has a height of n/3, actually go over?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
How many solutions are there?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.000
And please enter your answer in this box,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and let's go ahead and say that this is to the nth power--

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we'll go ahead and give you that--and type this in to 3 decimal places, please.
