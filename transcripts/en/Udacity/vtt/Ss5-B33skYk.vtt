00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.400
One last thing about
background subtraction.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.470
These days there are special
kinds of cameras,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.870
that instead of just giving us an RGB
value, they give us, RGB and D, depth.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.399
So you're familiar with the, the
Microsoft Kinect, because unless you're

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:17.084
living under a rock,
you know about the Microsoft Kinect.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:21.471
That's not a rock as in a Iran,
it's a rock as in granite.

00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:27.786
So anyway RGB-D cameras, you can
then do background in depth, right?

00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:31.630
So you take an image,
and the depth is fixed.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.884
That is, the lights might turn on and

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:39.380
off, the sun might cause a shadow to
move by, but the background is fixed.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.240
So, so in, in terms of its,
it's geometry.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.760
So you can actually do background
subtraction in terms of geometry.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.780
So you subtract on the d channel, and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.541
that's pretty cool and,
and very powerful.
