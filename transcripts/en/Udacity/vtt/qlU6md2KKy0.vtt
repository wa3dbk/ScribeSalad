00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.810
One thing to point out.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.670
We did start off by saying that this
is a plane, and we put a camera here.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.766
I rotate a camera about a projection
point, we create a planar surface or

00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.376
a mosaic.

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:15.083
Of course, this projection
plane can also be a cylinder.

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:21.350
Or a sphere which basically would
have curvatures on both sides.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.730
And again, by knowing this kind of stuff
we would actually be able to then also

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.230
do the similar kinds of projections.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.240
So here I'm just
rotating around a plane.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.790
But as I said, I could rotate
in this way, capture a cylinder,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.940
which basically has this thing.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.110
And also, in many instances,
move the camera up and down and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.170
also represent a sphere.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.230
So in essence bo,
basically be able go up and down.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.420
And this basically allows us to be
able to generate different types of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.030
panoramas.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.320
And we've looked at this
kind of stuff before.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.180
This basically showcases three
different types of panoramas.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.140
A planar panorama,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.840
which basically is trying to make
straight lines be straight lines.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.680
Of course, you notice that all
the lines are straight here.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.105
But this is more of
a spherical panorama,

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:05.530
where the lines in the middle
are straight, but if you look them,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.340
they curve around pretty badly at
the edges, and stuff like that.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.930
And, of course cylindrical panorama
is like this, where, again,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.870
we can actually model these
types of things correctly.
