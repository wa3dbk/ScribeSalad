00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.057
Thinking about the function you just filled out the table for, let's look at

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:11.361
what values f of x has, as x increases by 1, over and over again. 1x is 1. f of

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:19.925
1 is 2. 1x is 2. f of x is 4, or 2 times 2. And when x is 3, well, f of 3 is 8,

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:26.412
which is 2 times 2 times 2. To get f of 4, we would take f of 3 and multiply

00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:33.278
that by 2 one more time. I see a bunch of repeated multiplication here. Can you

00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:36.819
think of another way to write this? Think about things that you learned very

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:42.496
early on in this course. Please use that more compact notation to rewrite these

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:48.000
three values of f. Then please tell me what f of 10 is, what f of 100 is, and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.300
what f of x is.
