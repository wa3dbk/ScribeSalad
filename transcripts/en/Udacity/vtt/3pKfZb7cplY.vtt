00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.270
By now, I'm sure you have recognized that an operating system is a complex

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.700
software system. Especially the protocol stack that

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.400
sits within an operating system is several hundred

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.630
thousand lines of code. And developing such

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.620
a complex software system, in general, Protocol stack

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.520
in particular, to meet specs and also

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.080
deliver very good performance, is no mean challenge.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.490
Let's skip over to the other side of the fence and see how complex hardware

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.200
systems for example, a CPU chip like this one with billions of

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.190
transistors on it, is built. [UNKNOWN] technology uses

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.350
component based approach to building large and complex hardware systems.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.490
Can we mimic the same method for building large

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.710
complex software systems? That is, rather than start with a clean slate. Can

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.880
we reuse software components? It's very tempting

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.900
since component based design will be easier

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.080
to test and optimize at an individual component level and also it'll allow

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.730
for easy evolution and extension through the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.520
illusion and the leash and of components.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.360
The idea of component based design is

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.910
orthogonal to the structure of the operating system

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.080
that we've seen in previous lessons. Be it

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.920
a monolithic kernel or a microkernel based design,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.850
the idea of component based design can be

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.310
applied to each subsystem within an operating system.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.690
Of course, there are challenges. Can this lead

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.040
to inefficiencies in performance due to the additional

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.070
component level of function calls? Could it lead to loss of locality when we

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.990
cross boundaries of components? Could it lead

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.740
to unnecessary redundancies, such as copying, et cetera?

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.270
Is it possible to get the advantages

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.480
of component based design without losing performance? The

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.440
short answer is' yes' if you can

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.400
put theory and practice together. We will explore

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.030
this topic more in this lesson. The

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.920
idea is to synthesize Network Protocol Stack from

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.540
components. How do we do that? But that's what were going to see in this lesson.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.410
And in this lesson, kernel's ensemble project

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.220
is used as a backdrop to illustrate how

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.760
to build complex systems by using components.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.490
And using a component based approach to putting

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.610
together a large complex hardware system.
