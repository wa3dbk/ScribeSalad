00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:26.469
Now and then I think of when they were together.

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:34.108
Like when you found a route that went from X to Y

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:37.837
All those paths, they went through A and B, which

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:41.835
isolates them from that whole subtree. It was a

00:00:41.835 --> 00:01:03.336
bridge and it’s a bridge that now is severed.

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:06.671
You can try computing when a graph is all

00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:14.158
connected. You put the neighbors on a list, the

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:20.915
open list. So when I tried to run a depth-first

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:26.214
search. And found that half the graph was in I

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.794
guess it means it makes the search that more

00:01:28.794 --> 00:01:33.561
efficient.

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:38.440
But you didn’t have to cut the path. Drop that singular

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.370
connection, start a new component. Now each is in a

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.139
separate graph, so their reachable descendents have been

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:52.016
split in half. No it doesn’t change the time, big O or

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:56.351
the clustering coefficient in the social network.

00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.066
I guess that I don’t need that though.

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:06.963
Now there’s just no pathway that can use two nodes

00:02:06.963 --> 00:02:13.958
Now there’s just no pathway that can use two nodes

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:33.142
Now there’s just no pathway that can use two nodes

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:35.782
Now and then I think of all the times you chilled

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:41.917
me over. But had me believing it was always

00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:50.016
something that I'd done. But I don’t wanna loop

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:56.474
again. Though my running time is. You said you’d

00:02:56.474 --> 00:02:59.651
use efficient codes and you wouldn’t waste your

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.873
cycles finding pathways that can you to know

00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:06.900
But you didn’t have to cut the path. Drop that

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.846
singular connection, start a new component. Now

00:03:10.846 --> 00:03:14.130
each is in a separate graph, so their reachable

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.638
descendents have been split in half. No it doesn’t

00:03:18.638 --> 00:03:23.543
change the time, big O or the clustering coefficient

00:03:23.543 --> 00:03:27.485
in the social network. I guess that I don’t need that

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:28.360
though.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.062
Now there’s just no pathway that can use two nodes

00:03:32.062 --> 00:03:33.531
[No pathways]

00:03:33.531 --> 00:03:35.865

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.106
