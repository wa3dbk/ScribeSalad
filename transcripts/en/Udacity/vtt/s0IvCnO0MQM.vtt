00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.208
The two solutions are negative 9 halves and positive 5. Nice algebraic thinking

00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:09.180
for getting this one correct. We start by setting this equation equal to 0 by

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.630
subtracting 45 from both sides. Remember, for quadratic equations, we want to

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.745
get them in the form Ax squared plus Bx plus C. Where here, these numbers are

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:24.770
A, B and C. We want the other side of our equation to equal 0. Now we want to

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.414
find factors of A times C, or negative 90, that sum to negative one. Those

00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:34.774
factors are negative 10 and postivie 9. We use these factors as the

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:38.780
coefficients to rewrite our middle term. Then we use factoring by grouping to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.150
get these two factors. Next we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.746
For the first equation, we'll get x is equal to negative 9 halves and when we

00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:54.092
set the second factor equal to 0, we'll get x is equal to positive 5. Finally

00:00:54.092 --> 00:00:58.792
we write our solution set. Nice work if you got that correct.
