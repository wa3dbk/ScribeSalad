00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.260
This brings us to the end of the course.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.890
There are many more topics
that we could talk about, and

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.020
we encourage you to look at
the additional readings for the course.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.990
As we said at the beginning,
we have had a lot of fun

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.010
putting this course together,
and we have learned a lot, too.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.360
We hope you have enjoyed
the course as well.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.250
&gt;&gt; We're also really eager
to get your feedback.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.710
What did you enjoy about this course?

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.240
And what could have been improved?

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.650
What surprised you about this course,
either in the content or

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.510
in the way that it was administered?

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.470
Are there things that you've seen other
courses do that you wish we'd done, or

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.910
are things that we did that you'd
like to see other courses do?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.630
&gt;&gt; We are very interested in your
answers to these questions, so

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.840
please feel free to contact either
one of us with your answers, and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.210
fill out the course survey as well.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.770
&gt;&gt; We'd also like to
thank several people for

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.410
helping make this course possible.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.150
First, our video editor, Aaron,
who's done a phenomenal job making these

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.380
videos look so good and
frankly making us look presentable.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.900
We'd also like to thank the rest of
you at Assety, especially Jenny Kim,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.210
Jason Barrows, and Katie Reicult for
providing a great infrastructure for

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.370
course development.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.000
&gt;&gt; We'd also like thank our
colleagues here at Georgia Tech,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.010
including David White at
the college of computing.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.340
And Mark Weston and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.360
his staff at the Georgia
Professional Education Department.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.240
It's been a real fun journey for us.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.950
We expect to hear from you.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.720
We hope it's the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
