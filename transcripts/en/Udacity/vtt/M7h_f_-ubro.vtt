00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.480
Congratulations.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.560
You've finished the final project,
and reached the end of this course.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.620
You've created a data-driven
web application, and

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.300
have a beautiful restaurant
menu app to show for it.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.870
However, we've only scratched
the surface of web development, so

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.300
keep going from here.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.780
If you're interested in learning
more about the Flask framework,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.400
the Flask documentation is
a great place to start.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.260
Add more features to the restaurant
menu application, or create a new

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.060
application of your own, using some of
the more advanced features of Flask.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.410
I will also provide some links
in the instruction notes,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.760
on deploying a Flask application,
to be shared with the outside world.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.720
If you're interested in
adding more HTML, CSS, and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.670
JavaScript features to your website,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.050
take some time to check out some of
Udacity's awesome frontend classes.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.663
Wherever you decide to go next from
here, I strongly encourage you to

00:00:40.663 --> 00:00:43.358
immerse yourself in the web
development community.

00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:46.920
Read blogs, experiment, and share your
work with other web developers and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.985
enthusiasts like yourself.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.489
[SOUND].

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.120
Well, sounds like it's dinner time for
me over here.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.430
Thanks for
helping me show what's on the menu.
