Early stage entrepreneurship
is really hard.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.030
You have to do everything.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.340
And so, it's very easy to get off-track.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.040
It's very easy to dive down into trying
to build the perfect marketing plan,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.010
maybe we even don't have a product yet,
or

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.840
you can dive into the code of a product
making it perfect when it doesn't even

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.180
work yet, there's nothing to display,
nothing to show people.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.360
So, as an entrepreneur,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.270
the thing that you really have
to keep in mind is focus.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.170
What are the things that you're focused
on that are going to make your business

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.180
move forward?

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.720
It may not be the things that
you want to work on today.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.200
It may not be the things that
you think are the most fun.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.210
But you have to constantly step back and
say,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.950
okay, what is the most important thing I
need to do to move the business forward?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.270
And focus on that.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.620
And there are so many distractions, and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.380
you just have to let yourself move
forward and not get sidetracked.
