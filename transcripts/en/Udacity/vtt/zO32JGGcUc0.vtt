00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
So, wait.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.200
Brute force, 2 to the power of N, and now we have a 3 in the base of the exponent?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.700
Well, we probably need to do a little calculation here.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.950
So what I would like you to tell me is what 3 to the power of N/2

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.140
can actually also be expressed as.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.430
So 3 to the power of N/2 is a certain number to the power of N,

00:00:21.430 --> 99:59:59.000
and I would like you to enter this number with 3 digits after the decimal and please round it up.
