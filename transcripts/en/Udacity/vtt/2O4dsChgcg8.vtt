00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.570
The main shortcoming of DES,
is that it uses a 56 bit key.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.160
Which means the keyspace
is relatively small.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.350
To overcome this,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.420
we can run this multiple times,
each using a different key.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.000
The standard is to run DES three times.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.990
And this is called a triple DES.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.370
The standard is to run the encryption
process, then decryption process,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.580
then the encryption process again.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.880
And correspondingly for decryption, this
will mean to run the decryption process

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.230
first, then the encryption process,
then the decryption process again.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.220
And record that with DES, the decryption
process is actually the same as

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.810
the encryption process, only that we
apply the keys in the reverse order.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.140
The advantage of using
this order of operations,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.830
is that it supports
multiple key lengths.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.770
In particular If key 1 is the same as
key 3, then the result is a 112-bit DES.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.570
If all three keys are different,
then the result is a 168-bit DES.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.950
If we set key 2 the same as key 1,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.440
then the the triple DES has in effect
become a single DES with key three.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.690
This is useful for compatibility.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.550
For example a triple DES device
can be configured to communicate

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.255
with a single DES device, by simply
setting key 2, the same as key 1.
