00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.550
In the native Java Datastore API, all property

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.689
values are indexed by default. If you forget to

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.135
think carefully about which properties really need to be

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:12.455
indexed, you could end up with index bloat. However,

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:15.323
objectify helps you out and by default property

00:00:15.323 --> 00:00:18.960
values are not indexed when you use objectify. So,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.060
if you want a property to be indexed, you

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.930
need to add the @Index annotation to the property.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.470
However, if you prefer that by default all

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.119
the properties of a class are indexed, then you

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.670
add the @Index annotation to the class and

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.505
then you can add @UnIndex to each property that

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:43.050
you don't want to be indexed. You can

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.900
also add conditions so that a property's only indexed

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.180
if it meets certain criteria. For example, only index

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.410
a property if the value is greater than 100.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.530
There's good documentation about conditional indexing in the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.710
Objectify Developer's Guide. So what I'm going to want you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.860
to do next, is actually go read the developer's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.040
guide. It's at this link, or actually an easier

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.050
way to find it is just to search

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.630
on Google for objectify. This brings you down into

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.080
the open-source project for objectify. Then you click on

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.600
the wiki. And then, expand the users guide and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.340
you go to the queries and indexes page.
