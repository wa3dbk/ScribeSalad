00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.290
So our app isn't the most exciting or

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.154
interactive website
that's ever been created.

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:07.370
Let's spruce it up a bit by adding
an order manager to it that

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.790
will track what we're eating each day.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.580
We'll build up this order manager with
templates, controllers and a service.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.060
We'll need to create the service
that will be responsible for

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.829
managing the orders.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.830
This service will need to keep track
of what has been ordered for each day.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.100
To do that we can create a simple object
to keep track of each day's items.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.640
We also need to keep track of
the currently selected day, so

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.930
the user will know which day
they're ordering a menu item for.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.440
For this service to be useful,
it needs to manage this data.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.140
Consumers of this service should be
able to get the current list of orders.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.940
They should also be able to get and
set the active day.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.400
And last they should be able to
choose an item for a meal and

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.530
then remove an item from a meal.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.700
The order manager is now capable of
tracking anything the user wants to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.480
eat for any meal.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.480
Let's create a template and

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.330
control it to let the user keep
track of their menu items.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.820
We need a template that
will display our orders and

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.750
a controller that will set the initial
state for the template's expressions.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.414
Now let's add that template to the page.

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:13.732
To get the data to our template we need
to inject the order manager service

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:15.650
into the controller.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.050
Remember we do that by passing
an array of items to inject and

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.590
then the controller function
as the last item in the array.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.690
Now we can set the list property of
the controller to the orders returned by

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.120
the order manager.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.930
The controller is all set, so
we can now start modifying the template.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.330
We want to show the orders for
each meal and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.680
we want to repeat this list for
every day.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.140
That means we need
the ng-repeat directive.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.550
The first time through
day will be Monday and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.920
menu category will be this object.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.649
So now let's add the data
to our template.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.180
So we can now track orders but

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.910
the user doesn't have any
way to pick a menu item.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.220
In the menu template we'll add this
section where the user can pick when

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.970
they want to eat this menu item.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.870
And we'll need a button to let
them actually pick the meal.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.940
When the user clicks on this button
we'll send along the item's name and

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.630
when they want to eat it.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.380
We'll need to create this
choose item function.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.840
So in menu.js we'll create it.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.320
Order information is managed by
the order manager service, so we need to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.740
inject it into this controller so
we can pass along the data.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.540
Order manager already has
a method to let us add an item so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.680
we'll just pass the data to it.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.210
Now we can select an item and
choose when to eat it and

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.680
add it to the order manager.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.740
How cool is that?

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.960
Except we can only pick items for
Monday.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.940
Let's fix that.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.140
In the order template we need to make it
so that when we click on a specific day,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.360
we'll update the order manager's
active day to that one.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.220
So if Tuesday's clicked,
we'll pass that along and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.750
tell order manager to update
its active day to Tuesday.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.220
We just made a bunch of
modifications to our app and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.260
it's really starting to come together.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.900
If you got lost along the way,
just step back and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.820
remember what we're trying to do.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.580
Services maintain our data.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.260
We inject services into controllers, so

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.460
that controllers have
access to that data.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.610
And then we display
that data in templates.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.370
And again, services aren't tied to
specific views or controllers as we saw

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.340
with the order manager service that we
injected into two separate controllers.
