Now that our program draws the people in the social network, we need to make it

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.457
draw the friendships. I wrote a main method that creates three people, Sarah,

00:00:09.457 --> 00:00:15.610
Cheng-Han, and Cay, and then adds Cay and Cheng-Han to my friends. When I run

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.060
this main method, It draws connections from me to Cheng-Han and me to Cay. This

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.810
dot means that Cheng-Han is in my friends list, but not necessarily that I'm in

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.925
his. Your task now is to fix the person class so that when you run this main

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:37.090
method, it draws this picture. With the lines. Each person gets a picture when

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.710
the object's constructed. And when someone adds a friend, you draw a line, from

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.480
the person who who has a new friend, to the person who is the new friend. The

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.060
lines for now should just connect all of the top left corners of the pictures.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.470
This is a pretty complicated task right now. You might be thinking, you're not

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.890
really sure what to do first. So let's chat a little. Here's most of our code

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.145
for the Person class. You're only missing get friends at the bottom. And

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:07.380
y-coordinate over here. In which method should we add code that draws a line

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.798
between friends? The constructor, addFriend, unfriend, getFriends, or somewhere

00:01:15.798 --> 00:01:16.386
else?
