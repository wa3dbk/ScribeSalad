00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's do now a quiz on how control

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.520
dependencies affect the CPI of a pipeline. Let's say

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.350
that 25% of all of the instructions we

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.660
execute are taken branches and jumps. Let's say we

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.160
have a ten-stage pipeline. Let's say that the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.520
correct taken address for branches and jumps is computed

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.375
in the sixth stage of that pipeline. And let's

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:25.315
say that everything else flows smoothly so the CPI

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:29.696
would be one, if not for the taken branches. The question for you

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:34.120
is, what is the actual CPI in light of there being taken branches?
