00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.436
How is she doing that?

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:12.972
What am i missing?

00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:17.750
Well, you're using a code editor.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.980
So that's good.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.120
But it doesn't really look like
you're taking full advantage of it.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.770
You can absolutely do
exactly what she's doing, but

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.230
it's going to take
a little bit of practice.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.180
&gt;&gt; You guys know I can hear you, right?

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.740
&gt;&gt; Hey Jenny.
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.020
You're like five feet from me so.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.090
Anyway, what Cameron's saying is right.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.840
Learning how to code is like learning
a sport or playing a musical instrument.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.800
It just takes time and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.780
practice to get the muscle memory
you need to make it seem easy.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.700
&gt;&gt; And
that's what this lesson is all about.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.190
In this lesson you're going to
learn how to look like a hacker.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.420
You will be taking full advantage of
your code editors to write code faster

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.230
and more efficiently.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.900
Here, let me show you what you can do.
