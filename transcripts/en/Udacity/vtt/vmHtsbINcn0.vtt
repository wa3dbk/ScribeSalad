00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.219
So once again we're just going to use the
distributive property in the same way as

00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.463
we've done it many, many times before. The
difference this time and what may have

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.750
confused some people, is that our factor,
our little a up here. If you can see, is

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:17.090
actually two things multiplied together.
However that does not change the way that

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:21.106
we use the distributive property at all.
As always the -5y, the factor out in

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:25.660
front, is going to multiply each term
inside here, both the y And the z. So our

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:30.550
first term is going to be -5y * y, and our
second term is just going to be -5y * z.

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:35.945
Now again, I've just put an addition sign
between the two terms for simplicity right

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:41.110
now, so that I can determine the sign of
each term within the term itself, and then

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:45.948
change this to a - sign if I need to.
That's just a lot easier for me personally

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.606
to not get my signs mixed up. So now we
simplify within each term. And we end up

00:00:50.618 --> 00:00:56.106
with -5y^2 - 5yz. So you can see that no
matter how many things are multiplied

00:00:56.118 --> 00:01:01.085
together to create the factor that we have
out in front of our parentheses, they all

00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:04.057
multiply each of the terms within the
parentheses.
