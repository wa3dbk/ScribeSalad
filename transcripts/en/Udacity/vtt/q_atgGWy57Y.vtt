00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So in this problem, we start out with n
number of people with big heads and happy smiles.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And after every hexamester, each one of
our happy udacians goes out and asks

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
spread number of their friends
to also take the course.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This process continues as long as the
number of udacians is less than the target.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
With a little bit of math, you can solve
this pretty straightforward,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and you might have done it in
middle school or high school,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but we're going to use recursion
to solve this problem very easily.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Remember what we're looking for is the
number of hexamesters this process goes through

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
until we reach the target.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I saw on the forms a couple of people
were trying to use global variables

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that counted recursive calls,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but really that kind of defeats the purpose in
the power that we can use in the recursion.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm going to show you how to do that right now.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So our base case says that if we've met our
target, then we don't need any time to spread

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in order to reach the target because
we're already there.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now here I have a + 1 because we're
going to say that we're doing 1 iteration

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of the udacian spreading process.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now for the recursive call.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The first thing we need is n.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Well, n is going to be the same thing as last
time + how many new people we've gotten,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which is spread x n.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
A more succinct way of writing this would
be simply n x (1 + spread).

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The spreading rate doesn't change,
so we're going to leave that alone.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Our target doesn't change.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.541
And that's it. We're done.
