The important thing inheritance provides is a way to use attributes defined in

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.830
the Base class in the derived class without needing to cut and paste any code.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.368
Let's try a simple example to see how this works before getting back to our

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:16.798
Dishes. I hope no one's too hungry. Don't worry. Fried Python is a dish best

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:21.492
served cold. Let's start by supposing we have a Bear class. Which has a

00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:25.368
GrizzlyBear as a subtype. Here's the Bear. Don't be put off by its color and

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:29.360
peace symbol. Looks like a peaceful bear. It's actually very violent. And it's

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.741
got an eat method. It can eat a Human. Let's look at how that looks like in

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.364
code. Here's what that looks like in code. We've defined a Bear class, we've

00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:40.548
defined a GrizzlyBear with Bear as its base class. We don't actually have any

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:44.309
code in GrizzlyBear . In the bear class we've defined attributes. We got an

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.314
initializer that sets the name of the bear and we've got an eat method that eats

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:53.619
a victim. A victim has a name. We'll assume the victim is a Human. So let's see

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.667
how that works. I'm going to import from the bear class, the bear, GrizzlyBear,

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:00.916
and Human definitions. I haven't shown you Human, but you should be able to

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:04.470
guess what it is. We need to give the Bear someone to eat. And we'll create some

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.840
instances of those objects, a Human instance and we'll create a Bear instance.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.737
Since Bear has an eat method, the Bear should be able to eat a victim, and

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:18.274
indeed it can. We can also create a GrizzlyBear. We didn't define any attributes

00:01:18.274 --> 00:01:22.319
for GrizzlyBear, but it has some. The GrizzlyBear can also eat Dave. It's okay,

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.452
Dave can be used more than once. And we can look a little more closely at what

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:31.276
these attributes are, so it says that the bound method of the GrizzlyBear object

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:35.956
and the GrizzlyBear object is this one, the Bear object, also has an eat method

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:40.051
and it's of the Bear object. Now, this is an attribute, so we can assign it.

00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.771
Let's get rid of the eat method for Bear, because our Bear is a nice peaceful

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:48.694
bear. Did that change the eat method for the Grizzly? And it didn't. The eat

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:54.804
method for Grizzly is still there, that method got bound when the GrizzlyBear

00:01:54.804 --> 00:02:00.820
instance was created and the GrizzlyBear can still eat Dave as many time as he

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.434
wants.
