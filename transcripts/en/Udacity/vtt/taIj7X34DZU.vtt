00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.374
These two points are inside the circle, this point is on the circle and this

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:10.970
point is outside the circle. Great work if you got all four of them correct.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.120
Now if you weren't sure where to start, let's look at this first point and see

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.270
why it's on the circle. Then you might be able to figure out why these are

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.588
inside and this one's outside. Remember that this is really just a right

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:27.540
triangle in space. It has some horizontal distance x and some vertical distance

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.166
y. So we want to be sure that when we plug in the values for x like negative 6

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:40.620
and the value of y like positive 8, we get 100. So squaring negative 6 and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.400
squaring 8 we'll get 36 plus 64 which equals 100. So yes, it turns out that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.010
this statement is true. This means that the point negative 6, 8 Is a point on

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.578
our circle, since it satisfies the equation. We also know that this point is on

00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:01.970
our circle since we can set up a right triangle. The point, negative 6, 8 is 6

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.248
units left from the origin and 8 units up. If we use the Pythagorean theorem

00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:13.448
here, we'll discover that this side, or this radius, is 10. This should also

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:18.388
make sense because we really have a 3, 4, 5 triangle. The triangle has just

00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:24.035
been multiplied by 2 to give us a 6, 8, 10 triangle. So we know that the

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:29.368
distance from the origin to this point is 10 units. And that matches with our

00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:34.808
idea that any point on our circle is 10 units from the center. So, by checking

00:01:34.808 --> 00:01:38.224
the point in our calculations or by drawing out a diagram, we can know that

00:01:38.224 --> 00:01:44.173
this point is definitely on our circle. For this point, it turns out it will be

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:49.425
inside. When we check the point negative 9, 4, we'll plug in x with the value

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:55.494
of negative 9, and we'll substitute the value of y with 4. Simple, find the

00:01:55.494 --> 00:02:00.382
left-hand side of our equation we'll get 97. We know that's not equal to 100,

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:05.430
and in fact this is less than 100. Since negative 9 squared plus 4 squared

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.021
equals 97, we really know that we're inside the circle. Remember that 10 is the

00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:16.370
radius of our circle, it's the square root of this number. So, this means the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.314
distance from the origin to this point is the square root of 97 which is

00:02:20.314 --> 00:02:25.550
definitely less than 10. The right triangle for this point would look like this

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.719
we'd have 9 units to the left of the origin and then 4 units up. This point

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.180
would just be shy of reaching our circle. We know that the distance from the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.369
origin to this point is the square root of 97. It's the square root of this

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:44.344
number. We really want this distance to be 10 or the square root of a 100 and

00:02:44.344 --> 00:02:49.028
its not, its less than that. So that's how we know that this point is inside

00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:55.367
the circle. The same would be true for the point 7, negative 7. If we plug in x

00:02:55.367 --> 00:03:00.451
with the value of 7 and y with a value of negative 7 we'll get the statement 98

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:07.176
equals 100. This isn't true so we know that the distance from the origin to

00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:13.447
this point is less than 10. So this point must be inside. And finally for this

00:03:13.447 --> 00:03:20.566
point when we plug in x with a value of 5. And y with the value of 9, will get

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:26.370
106 equal to 100. This isn't true and we know that 106 is greater than 100,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.658
that means that the distance of 5, 9, from the origin, is greater than 10. The

00:03:32.658 --> 00:03:37.827
point, 5, 9 would be, just outside of our circle. We can even see this one

00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:43.476
desmos. Here's the equation of our circle and we can see that the point

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:49.158
negative 6, 8 is on it. Even if we zoom in, we can quickly see that, yes, the

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:55.358
point is on the circle. And then this other point negative 9, 4 isn't. It's

00:03:55.358 --> 00:04:00.410
just slightly inside of our circle. The other point that we said was inside the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.838
circle is 7, negative 7. This point down here. Zooming in on this region, we

00:04:06.838 --> 00:04:10.861
see that it's just shy of being on the circle. And that should make sense,

00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:14.281
because we found that the distance from the origin to this point, was the

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:19.620
square root of 98. Almost the square root of 100, which is 10 to the circle.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.749
And finally, we looked at the point 5, 9. This orange point out here. Zooming

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:30.349
in we see that, yes, it's just outside of our circle.
