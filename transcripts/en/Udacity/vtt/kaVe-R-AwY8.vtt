00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let us simulate the situation in our IE.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let us assume the individual subpatches all identified by numbers from 1 to 8.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Again, we write a testing function that simulates the behavior of the system.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We assume that if the patches 3 and 6 are applied, then the failure occurs.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If patches 3 and 6 are not applied together, then the failure does not occur.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Thanks to the beauty of Python, all of our infrastructures

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we had previously set up for string also works for lists.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's see what happens if we test the entire set of patches.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We see it fails, which is not much of a surprise because 3 and 6 are both in here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If we test the empty list instead, that is no patches applied, then the test passes.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Again, we print out the list we're testing, its length and the result.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, we can again invoke delta debugging with the set of patches and the above test function.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let's see how this works. We invoke ddmin to see whether we can simplify this list of patches

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to see which of these patches are relevant.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Press on run, here we get the result, and the final result is patches 3 and 6 suffice to cause the failure.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well, that's something we knew all along, didn't we?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If your original patch would have been 10,000s of lines long,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
then chances are that delta debugging reduces this to just two lines

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
or another very small set of locations in your code for which you didn't know.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But if you change these two lines, the failure will occur

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and if you don't change them, the failure will not occur.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This approach for determining the culprit for regression has also been named

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the blame-o-meter, as a means to know who to blame.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Where who to blame means which places in the code are to blame

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but it can also mean which patches are to blame and it can also mean

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
which programmers made these changes which are now to blame.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The idea is that such a scheme can be used in any situation

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in which an old version work and a new version does not.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So when you have any regression test failing and the regression test does exactly that

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
comparing the results of the new version against the old version,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
you can and possibly should run delta debugging in order to figure out

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
which lines in the code are actually responsible for the failure.
