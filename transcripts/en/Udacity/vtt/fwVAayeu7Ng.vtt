00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.860
The next step is going to be to distribute the 3 to both terms over here on the

00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:07.689
left side, and leave the right side the same as it was. And then, I just need to

00:00:07.702 --> 00:00:11.445
collect all of my variables on one side and all of my constants on the other

00:00:11.457 --> 00:00:15.330
side. And we get a final answer of x equals 22. In all the problems we've done

00:00:15.342 --> 00:00:19.135
so far, it just so happened that it was most convenient for us to end up with

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:23.165
variables on the left side and constants on the right side. However, that's not

00:00:23.177 --> 00:00:27.025
necessary. I could very easily have decided that I wanted my variables on the

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:30.500
right side, instead of the left side. And started out here by subtracting 3x

00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:34.025
from both sides. I would have just had, eventually, to divide by a negative

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:37.675
number. And that's not always my favorite thing to do. But in the future, feel

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:41.075
free to put the constants and the variables on either side of the equation.

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:42.425
Whatever is easiest for you.
