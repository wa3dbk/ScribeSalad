00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] What is the one test I have here?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
First I've defined 3 hands.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
sf stands for a straight flush, fk stands for 4 of a kind,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and fh stands for full house.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I've defined those by taking this string, splitting the string up on the spaces,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and so that will give me a list of 5 cards for each of these 3 possible hands.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And then I've asserted that when we play a game of poker between these 3 hands

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that the winning hand is the straight flush.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The whole idea of having tests like this is a vital part of software development.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's important that each part of the specification gets turned into a piece of code

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that implements it and a test that tests it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So here we have only 1 test.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is a test that tests part of the implementation of the poker function.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you don't have tests like these, then you don't know when you're done,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and you won't know if you've done it right,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and you won't have confidence that any future changes might not be breaking something.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So remember, to be a good programmer, you must be a good tester.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Write your test cases and test them often.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I want you to add 2 more tests:

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
1 test that will test whether the winner between 4 of a kind and full house is correct--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and so what should that be? It should be 4 of a kind--

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and another test that seems a little bit more trivial

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but testing if we have 2 copies of full house playing each other

00:01:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that full house indeed is the winner out of those 2.
