Thanks, Chris, for teaching us how to find and factor out the greatest common

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:09.043
factor or GCF. For this practice problem, I want you to factor out the GCF and

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:13.950
put the GCF in front, and the remaining terms in parentheses following. So we

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.696
have 27 q squared p cubed, minus 18 q squared p squared, plus 45 q p cubed. Put

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:23.939
your answer in this box.
