00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.650
The most important field in a Snort
rule header is the action field.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.300
It tells Snort what to do when it
finds a packet that matches the rule.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.970
Here are the possible actions.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.510
The last three are only applicable when
Snort is configured as an inline sensor.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.730
To summarize, a Snort rule has
a header and multiple options.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.890
Each option consists of an option
keyword which defines the option,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.770
followed by arguments which
specify the details of the option.
