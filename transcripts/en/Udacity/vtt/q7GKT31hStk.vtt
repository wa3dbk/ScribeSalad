00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.754
But how in general do reflections like the ones we were just looking at show up

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:08.194
in equations? Well, as a simple system to work with, let's just look at these

00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:12.310
three points for now. You have the point 1,1, the point 4,2, and the point 9,3.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.106
If we take these three points and reflect them in the x-axis, what new points

00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:23.874
will we end up with? Please write the coordinates of each point in their

00:00:23.874 --> 00:00:27.419
reflection that corresponds to each original point.
