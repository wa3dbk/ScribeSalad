00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.780
As an entrepreneur thinking
about how you take feedback and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.010
how you figure out how you incorporate
that feedback into your business.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.770
I think the most important thing is,

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.040
as an entrepreneur can
you take a step back?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.870
Can you back away from maybe a narrow
problem you're trying to solve right

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.450
now, and really look at the big picture?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.400
And can you take the feedback that's
coming in and apply it to the big

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.330
picture, without being so distracted
from what's happening in the weeds?

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.060
In particular for early stage companies,
if you look at the founders and

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.360
the co-founders, you know, they're
selling the product, they're building

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.350
the product, they're marketing it,
they're doing customer service.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.750
And sometimes you can get so

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.660
focused on the detail, that when
somebody provides you feedback,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.510
you don't understand how to take it,
unless you can really step back.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.200
And that's a really important
attribute of a founder,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.200
is can you step back from all of
the detail that you're working on and

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.210
incorporate the feedback
that's coming in.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.660
And change directions if you need to.
