00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.717
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's put our knowledge to use. What are the x and y-intercepts for these

00:00:03.717 --> 00:00:07.924
lines? Some of these intercepts might be fractions and that's okay. Whenever you

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:11.824
write an x-intercept or a y-intercept be sure you write it as a point, remember

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:15.777
there are two coordinates here. For these questions, I just want you to enter

00:00:15.777 --> 00:00:19.291
the numbers here and the same in these two. I've already included the

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.953
parenthesis and commas for you.
