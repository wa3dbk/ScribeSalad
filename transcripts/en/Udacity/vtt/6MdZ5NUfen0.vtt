00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.776
I know this is pretty complicated and that's why this entire lesson is pretty

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:09.470
much on confidence intervals. Let's just analyze a good old normal distribution.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:17.990
So here we have 95%, well if 95% is in the middle that means 2.5% is here and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.772
2.5% is here. So what's the Z score here? If you look at the Z table, and look

00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:35.627
for 0.025, or 2.5%, you see that it's at negative 1.96. So Z is negative 1.96

00:00:35.627 --> 00:00:44.019
here and positive 1.96 here. So 0.13 can either be 1.96 standard deviations

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:51.279
above the mean, like it is here if this were the population distribution. Z 0.13

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:58.511
is 1.96 standard deviations above mu sub i. Or 0.13 can be 1.96 standard

00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:05.720
deviations below the true population mean. So if this sample mean is 1.96

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.090
standard deviations below the true population mean, then this true population

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.387
mean would be the sample mean plus 1.96 standard deviations away. And you found

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:27.379
that 1 standard deviation is 0.024. However, if the sample mean is actually

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:34.483
greater than the true population mean, then the true population mean is 0.13

00:01:34.483 --> 00:01:41.988
minus 1.96 standard deviations. And then if we calculate what these values are

00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:49.176
we get .083, approximately, and .177. So then our interval estimate for the 95%

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:57.713
confidence interval has a lower bound of 0.083. And an upper bound of 0.177. Now

00:01:57.713 --> 00:02:02.850
really quick, always remember what these numbers mean. Most numbers have units

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.216
of some sort. This is the ratio of minutes watched of all the lessons to total

00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:15.781
minutes available. So we're predicting that, if I incorporated this musical

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:21.981
lesson then the entire population of 8,702 students will watch between 83

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:28.430
thousandths and 177 thousandths of all content available. So if we set it up

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.730
like this and we want to know how many minutes students will watch out of every

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.257
60 minutes available, 60 times 0.083 is about 5 minutes. And then on the upper

00:02:41.257 --> 00:02:48.298
bound, they could watch up to 0.177 minutes for every minute available. And out

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:55.680
of 60 minutes, that's about 10.62. Since we found that the engagement ratio

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.020
right now Is 0.077. That's about 4.62 minutes watched out every hour of content

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.044
available. Then according to our calculations, we're pretty sure that this

00:03:07.044 --> 00:03:12.060
musical lesson will increase the amount video watched to at least 5 minutes and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.115
possibly up to 10.62 minutes for every hour of content available. So if all of

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:23.073
this actually happened, then we could say that my song increased the engagement.
