00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.442
It's important to be able to reason about this the way that I just described to you, right?

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:05.776
So we sort of walked our way through.

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:10.847
We figured out what kind of bandwidth we were getting and what percentage of theoretical peak that was.

00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:16.337
We saw that it was really quite low and we said, why would we be getting low bandwidth-to-global memory?

00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:19.386
Well, the first thing you always look at there is coalescing.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.226
And then we inspected the code and convinced ourselves that, yes,

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:25.262
there's bad coalescing happening when we write to the output matrix.

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:31.204
But, I also want to make the point that you don't have to do this from scratch every time.

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:35.405
Right? Doing all these calculations is a little bit like rubbing two sticks together to start a fire;

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:38.240
it's good to know how, but there are tools to help you do this.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.176
The tool that we're going to be using is called nSight.

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:44.590
This is an Nvidia product, there's also third-party products.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.749
Maybe I'll give some links to those in supplementary material.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:54.155
And if you're using Linux or a Mac like I'm using, then you'll be using the nSight Eclipse edition.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:58.661
If you were using Windows, you'd by using nSight Visual Studio edition.

00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:04.099
These are integrated debuggers and profilers, they're full-blown development environments.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.246
The part that we're going to use is called the Nvidia Visual Profiler, or NVPP.

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:11.340
Let's fire that up now.
