00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.230
When discussing how to position
views in the last quiz,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.160
you may have mentioned
using a relative layout.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.850
I know we did.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.670
But I want to introduce you to another
way that you can build the layout for

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.890
our app that would be more ideal,
using nested viewgroups.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.120
Nested viewgroups means putting
viewgroups inside other viewgroups.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.150
That way you can build more interesting
and complex layouts like these.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.050
Let's see how you would build
up one of these layouts.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.620
Say, for example, you have a vertical
linear layout with three views,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.840
an image view and two text views.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.000
What if you wanted to overlay
some text on top of this image?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.470
Well, with a linear layout,
you can't overlap views.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.390
But with a relative layout, you can, so

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.470
we can replace this child with
a relative layout instead.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.750
Then, we can put the image view
inside this relative layout.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.950
This image view is now aligned to each
edge of the parent relative layout.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.410
So, there you see an example of a
relative layout that's contained within

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.899
a larger linear layout.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.850
You can have many combinations of
view groups within other view groups.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.900
For instance, you can have a relative
layout as a root view for an app.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.270
That can contain a couple of views
like an image view and two text views.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.910
You can also add a linear layout as
a child of this broader relative layout.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.490
This linear layout itself can contain
other children like two image views.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.340
You can nest as many view groups
inside other view groups as you want.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.540
However, be careful because
the more nesting that you do,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.810
the more expensive it will be for
your app to lay out on the screen.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.990
The relative layout, in particular, is a
very flexible layout but it can be very

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.490
complex to calculate the position of
each of these views relative to others.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.380
So it's recommended to not have
too many layers of nesting

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.380
within a relative layout.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.730
I pulled some examples from real life
Google apps to show you some cases where

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.840
it would be useful to
use nested view groups.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.060
The Google Now app shows you
cards of relevant information

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.250
based on your current situation, like
the current time or current location.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.310
If you like a certain
team like the Red Sox,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.040
good choice, then it can show you
the score for the latest game.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.570
To build out the layout for this card,
you can imagine using a vertical linear

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.160
layout because the information
is displayed as rows.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.130
However, the first item in this vertical
linear layout is not just a single text

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.380
view, it's made up of multiple views.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.562
In fact, you would build this first
item as a horizontal linear layout,

00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:25.325
made up of an image view and
two text views.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.085
Same for the second item in
this vertical linear layout.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:31.205
You would build it with a horizontal
linear layout containing an image view

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:32.865
and two text views.

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:35.785
Another card in the Google Now app
shows relevant stocks that you

00:02:35.785 --> 00:02:37.315
may be interested in.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:39.710
I wish the Google stock
was still at that price.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.390
Anyways, you can also build out this
layout as a vertical linear layout,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.740
because you can imagine the rows here.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.410
Except these middle entries
aren't just a single text view,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.640
they're made up of multiple text views.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.280
For this line item relating
to the Google stock price,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.340
you could use a horizontal linear layout
and fill it with four text views.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.670
Same for the other stock prices as well.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.690
These horizontal linear layouts
are children of this broader

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.620
vertical linear layout.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.050
In the Google Play music app,
you can, of course, listen to music.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.260
While this looks like
a complicated layout to build,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.850
you can actually break it down into
smaller view groups that you recognize.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.530
This pattern feels like
a vertical linear layout

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.260
with three different children.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.620
This first child can be built
using a relative layout,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.200
because the views
are relative to each other.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.360
The second child can also be
built using a relative layout,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.990
because the views
are overlapping each other.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.800
And this third child here looks
like a horizontal linear layout

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.080
made up of five different buttons.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.480
Again, we can use nested view
groups to build out this screen.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.970
This is just one way to
build out the layout.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.318
You can build it in many
other ways as well.

00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:48.667
In the Google Maps app, earlier we
saw that there are detailed pages for

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:51.500
individual locations, like restaurants.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.150
You can't build out this screen
with just a single linear layout or

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.420
a single relative layout.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.740
You need to nest a bunch
of view groups together.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.500
On a broad scale,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.860
we can see that the information
is almost organized into rows.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.400
So, we can use a vertical linear
layout as the parent view.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.900
One child could be
this whole layout here.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.330
Another child could be
this row of buttons.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.725
Another child would be this
description and so on.

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:16.894
But within each child is
not just a single view.

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:18.935
We have multiple views.

00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:23.762
This child in the broader linear layout
is made up of three individual views.

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:26.472
So you can use
a horizontal linear layout

00:04:26.472 --> 00:04:30.042
with equal weights to each view so
that they get spread out evenly.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:34.662
This child in the broader vertical
linear layout can also be made

00:04:34.662 --> 00:04:37.636
up of a horizontal linear layout
with an image view and a text view.

00:04:37.636 --> 00:04:43.036
If you keep scrolling this page, you
see more information on the restaurant.

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:47.276
Again, I can imagine the individual
rows of information here.

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:49.873
Using a vertical linear layout for
all this information still works,

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:54.503
and, again, some rows are more
complex than just a single text view.

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:58.313
This row shows a bunch of available
times where you can make a reservation,

00:04:58.313 --> 00:05:01.143
and it's made up of three different
buttons that you can arrange using

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:03.063
a horizontal linear layout.

00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:07.563
This row of pictures can be built using
a horizontal linear layout as well.

00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:10.383
And actually,
within this horizontal linear layout,

00:05:10.383 --> 00:05:13.360
this first child is not
just a single image view.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.230
It's an image view with a text view.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.680
So you could use a relative layout
to build out this first child.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.520
So you could see how there can be
view groups, within view groups,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.100
within view groups.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.790
There's actually more view groups
beyond just relative layout,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.905
and linear layout, there's also
frame layout and grid layout.

00:05:30.905 --> 00:05:33.705
We're not going to have time to cover
those in this course, but I definitely

00:05:33.705 --> 00:05:37.215
recommend that you go out and learn
about them on your own because sometimes

00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:39.796
those would be better than just
using a relative or a linear layout.
