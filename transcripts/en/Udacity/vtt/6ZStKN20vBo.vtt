00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the next topic that we're going to cover is called the "Automated Whitebox Testing."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And this isn't in the form of code coverage but what rather is way to get software tools to automatically  

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
generate test for your code, so you wrote some code and the questions were going to ask is  

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"How to generate good test cases for it?"

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And of course one answer is we can use the kind of techniques that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I've been talking about for this entire class. We can think about the code. We can make up inputs.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can basically just work hard to get a good test coverage but another answer is we can run  

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
one of this automated whitebox testing tools and so let's see how that works.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For this tools goal is to generate good path coverage of the code that you wrote.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So let's start of basically just making up random values for your code.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's say one on one for the inputs. So now let's just go ahead and execute the code.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The first question, is this a prime number? And so it's not.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It wasn't prime the first time but it's still not prime so we're going to return zero.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So now that the automated testing tool has seen a path through the code

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that didn't take both of the if branches so we will try to construct the new set of inputs

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
for the function but take a different path.  

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So the most obvious choice point to start with is the first if.    

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So the question the tool is going to ask is, "How can a generated input that's prime?" 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so to do that of course, it's going to have to look at the code, the test for formality

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so it's going to end up with this sets of constraints on the value of a which are going to be pass  

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to a constraint solving tool and the answer if the solver succeeds is going to be a new value of a  

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that passes the formality test, so let's say a is three. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Though automated whitebox testing tools come up with a new set of input dysfunction  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
its going to go ahead and run in again. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So this time the first test is going to succeed a is prime, we're going to increment b by 3  

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
decrement a by 10 and now a is going to fail the formality test since let's assume 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
our formality check one at a time detect positive. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now the new value of a minus 7 is going fail the formality test and we're going again return zero. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So the question we have is, was the tool learned?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What is learned is one execution that falls straight through.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Another execution that takes the first def badge, so now what its going to do

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is try to build on that knowledge to generate inputs that also take the second branch.       

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So its going to take the first set of constraints that is the constraints of course a to be prime.  

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Its going to add another number set of constraints that force the updated value of a  

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that is to say a value of 10 lasts than the original value of a to be prime.   

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So its going to turn that all one to a set of constraints pass it to the solver

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and the solver is either going to succeed in coming up with a new value of a or possibly it will fail    

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but let's assume it succeeded and so let's say that the value of a that comes with this time is 13. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We're going to execute the function again, 13 is prime, so we're going to add 3 to b   

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
subtract 10 from a giving 3, 3 is prime, so now we're going to ask if b is an even multiple of 20. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
If so we would return 7 but its not so we're going to return zero.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The third time through the function, its going to add a new constraint.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So not only are we keeping all our constraints on a but writing a new constrain on b    

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the b mod 20 has to come out to be zero and so this time the solver, let's say, 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
comes up with a is 13 and b is 20.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now its going to execute the function another time, this time returning 7.  

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And so by iterating this process multiple times that is to say by running the code 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and then using what it learned about the code build up a set of constraints to explore different pass  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
what we can do is generate a set of test inputs that taken together

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that use good coverage for the code under test. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Unfortunately, I don't know of any automated whitebox testing tools that exists for Python     

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to receive programer is a tool called Klee that you should try out which implements this techniques  

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and I encourage you to do this, Klee is really an interesting tool. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And so as you might expect, in real situations of tool like this might fail to be able

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to come up with a useful system of constraints or to solve them for really big codes

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and in fact that's absolutely the case

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
These tools blow up and fail on very large codes but for smaller codes like the kind of thing I'm

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
showing you here and actually they're are really nice job of automatically generating good test inputs

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and as it turns out these techniques are used fairly heavily by Microsoft to test their products

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
in the last several years for the finding of a very large number of bugs in real products.
