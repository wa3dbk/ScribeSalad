00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.719
Well, those are the diagrams types. I just wanted to repeat that

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.560
no particular system that you develop is going to use all of them. And, in fact,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.370
you're probably going to concentrate on the most popular ones. But

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.060
they're there in case you need them.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.450
I also want to mention two other features of UML that don't involve diagrams.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.313
[COUGH] One is the Object Constraint Language and the other one,

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:25.980
I hinted tthat a few minutes ago, the Metamodel. The Object Constraint Language,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
and we'll devote a whole lesson to this, is a textual extension to UML's vis,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.370
visual notation. Its purpose is to provide a more precise specification,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.420
to be able to specify things which you can't specify in the diagrams themselves.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.660
You can use this textural extension as annotations to class model diagrams,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.706
and statechart diagrams. Essentially, the Object Constraint Language,

00:00:51.706 --> 00:00:55.880
this first-order predicate logic, plus the ability to navigate around

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.940
the diagrams and some collection classes, like sets and, and bags and sequences.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.239
The overall purpose of the Constraint Language, Object Constraint Language,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.620
is to be very precise, if you need to, in the specifications of your system.
