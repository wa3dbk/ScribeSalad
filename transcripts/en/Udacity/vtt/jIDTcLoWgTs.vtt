00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, let's do one last modification and let's write this procedure

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
assuming you observed a negative test result.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This means the posterior of having cancer under a negative result is

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
0.0137 for those numbers over here and about 0.00336 for those numbers over here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In both cases, the posterior is significantly smaller than the prior

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
because we received negative test results.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, go ahead and modify your procedure accordingly.
