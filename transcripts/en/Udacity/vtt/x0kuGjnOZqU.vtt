Welcome to lesson two.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:07.150
This lesson comes primarily from Udacity
course called Intro to HTML and CSS.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.160
When I took this course it was really
helpful for me, because the two

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.260
instructors, Jessica and Cameron, do
a really good job of giving you a really

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.860
thorough, deep understanding of how the
web works and how HTML is structured.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.470
So, as you watch this lesson,
which is taught primarily by Jessica,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.540
pay attention to how she really focuses
on the structure of a HTML document and

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.570
how web browsers
interpret that structure.
