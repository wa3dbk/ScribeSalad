Now let's see if we are all on the same page

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.180
on the concept of testing specifications, and we're going to do that through

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.280
a quiz. What I would like for you to do is to

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.830
tell me, what are some possible test specifications that will satisfy the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.380
requirements that we just saw? And I want you to express this

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.270
specification in terms of constraints on

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.166
the inputs. Which means, what constraints

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:23.130
should the input satisfy in order for this statement to be executed,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.210
and this statement to be executed, and you can write your answer

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.510
here in these two slots.
