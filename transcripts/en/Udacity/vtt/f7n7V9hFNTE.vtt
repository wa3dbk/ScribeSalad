00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.861
Since point p is a point that is shared, by both the line, y equals 850, and the

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:13.480
line y, equals 10x plus 150, both of these lines have the same y value at that

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:20.601
point. Since the y value of y equals 850 is always 850, that means that this the

00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:28.119
y value of 10x plus 150 at point p. So, we just need to substitute 850 into the

00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:36.118
spot of y, in the second equation. That gives us a single equation of 850 equals

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:44.016
10x plus 150. And yes, x is the only variable in this equation.
