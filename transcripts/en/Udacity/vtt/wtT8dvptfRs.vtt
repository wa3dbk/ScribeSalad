00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.863
So it turns out that this first combination of coefficients for x 6 and 1 does

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:09.791
not work, this is the wrong one we can only know that though by trying out these

00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:14.873
different numbers, now if we could have put a negative one here and the negative

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:19.878
one here that our middle term would have become 6x trans negative 1 or negative

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:24.729
6x minus x which is negative 7x But unfortunately, -1 times -1 does not equal

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:29.411
-5. We could do that same exact process for each of the 4 numbers in this slot

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:33.443
figuring out what they would need to be over here to come up with -7 to

00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:38.021
eventually rule out all of the possibilities up here. Going with the same

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:43.013
process down here, for the factors that have 3x and 2x in them, shows us that we

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:47.693
need a -5 here and a 1 here .So that to get our middle term, we have 3x times 1

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:53.577
minus 10x, or negative 7x. Negative 5 times 1 is negative 5. So this is what

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:54.207
works.
