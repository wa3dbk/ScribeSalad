Three of these are not polynomials, but
the rest of them are. We learned that a

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:08.681
polynomial is an expression that only uses
addition, subtraction, and multiplication

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:13.329
to combine constants variables. But this
first trace right here has a big division

00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:17.505
sign in it, dividing one expression by
another expression. Now if we had either

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:21.740
the numerator or the denominator of this
fraction on its own, then both of them

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:26.202
would be polynomials. But because they're
divided, this is not a polynomial, so

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:30.555
we'll check that one off. We'll talk more
about expressions that look like this

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:34.790
later on the course. One of our other
important rules is that a polynomial must

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:39.202
have exponents in it that are only non
negative integers. Right here we have x to the 1/2

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:43.537
and 1/2 may be positive, but it's not an
integer, so that means that this is not a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:48.998
polynomial. We can think about that rule
again when we look at this answer choice

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.122
right here, -6x^5+x^-3-11x+9.
All of these terms in here are fine for

00:00:54.134 --> 00:01:00.238
being part of polynomials, except for this
one x^-3, because -3 is a negative integer

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.892
exponent, not a non-negative integer
exponent. So that means this expression is

00:01:05.904 --> 00:01:10.907
not a polynomial. It may seem a little bit
funny that 6 counts as a polynomial. We

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:15.225
don't often talk about numbers or
variables on their own as polynomials, but

00:01:15.237 --> 00:01:19.419
they technically do qualify since they do
fit our definition. We said that

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:23.787
polynomials could have just variables,
just constants, or both. So 6 and all

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.879
other constant terms are technically
polynomials. We're going to talk about

00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.867
polynomials throughout the entire rest of
the course, so it's great to get a handle

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:32.008
on how to find them.
