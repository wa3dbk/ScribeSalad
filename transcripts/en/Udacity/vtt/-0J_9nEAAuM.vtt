00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.556
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well this equation certainly makes things a little bit easier. Because we did

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:06.971
the same thing to both sides, I mean, didn't do anything crazy, like try to

00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:10.500
divide by 0, whatever answers we come up with from here on out will still work

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.265
for our original equation, either of these two right here. The difference is

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:17.793
that now when we solve, we only have to deal with two factors that are

00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:22.014
multiplied together instead of three, like we had when we had that constant term

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:26.289
out here as well. Let's think about what we can deduce at this point. We have

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.554
two factors that when multiplied together give us 0. Let's call one of them a

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:34.903
and the other one b. Then we can write this equation as ab equals 0. Thinking

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:39.959
about this equation, can we conclude anything about what either a or b should

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:42.191
equal? Please answer yes or no.
