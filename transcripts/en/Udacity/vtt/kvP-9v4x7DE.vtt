00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.840
Let's hope the drinking bird look a bit better still by having its body made out

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.055
of glass. I'll do the geometry improvements, you do the glass material. I've now

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:13.234
split the body into two pieces, an exterior shell and an interior blue fluid. On

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:16.718
the left, the blue fluid here is without the shell. And on the right is how

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:20.715
things look with the shell. Clearly the shell needs to be made well clear in

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:25.147
order to see the fluid inside. Your job is to make this material transparent.

00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:29.302
The fluid's material is called body material in the code. The glass body uses a

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:33.766
new material called glass material. The current glass material's shininess is

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.862
fine as it's set, but otherwise, needs fixing. I want you to set the glass

00:00:37.862 --> 00:00:42.692
bodies materials so that it's 30% opaque, and of course, transparent. Regular

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:48.491
material color, fully black, in other words, 000. And the specular color, fully

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:52.551
white, 111. When you have the glass materials set correctly, your solution

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.223
should look something like this.
