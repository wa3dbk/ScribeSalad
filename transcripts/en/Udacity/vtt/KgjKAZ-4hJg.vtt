00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.000
As we discussed, one of the major reason for DNSs vulnerabilities is a lack of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.520
authentication. The DNS sec protocol adds authentication

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.870
to DNS responses simply by adding signatures to

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.240
the responses that are returned for each DNS reply.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.461
When a stub resolver issues a query, assuming there is no caching, the query is

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:27.855
relayed by the recursive resolver to the root

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.870
name server. Which, as we know, sends a referral

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.790
to .com, but this referral includes the signature by

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.000
the root of the IP address and the public

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.570
key of the .com server. As long as this

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.010
resolver knows the public key corresponding to the route,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.090
it can check the signature and it knows then,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.950
that the referral is to the correct IP address

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.980
for .com. It also now knows the

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.930
public key corresponding to the .com server, thus

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.965
when the .com server sends the next referral

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:04.920
to Google.com, that referral is signed by .com's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.720
private key. But the root has told the

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.010
resolver the public key corresponding to .com, and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.440
thus the resolver can check that this referral

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.970
is not bogus and in fact, came from

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.100
the .com server. Similarly, the .com server

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.105
will return, not only the IP address for

00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:25.470
Google.com, but also the IP address and public

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.830
key for the Google.com authoritative name server. So

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.520
that when Google returns its answers, the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.060
resolver can check the signatures coming from google.com.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.990
In other words, each authoritative name server in

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.850
the DNS hierarchy returns not only the referral,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.830
as it would with regular DNS, but also a signature containing the IP address

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.940
for that referral. And the public key

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.520
for the authoritative name server that corresponds

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.610
to that referral. That public key then

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.330
allows the resolver to check the signatures

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.060
at the next lowest level of the hierarchy, until we finally get to the answer.
