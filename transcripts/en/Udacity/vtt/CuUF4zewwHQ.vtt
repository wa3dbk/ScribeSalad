00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.719
So now that we've got this functional shared version of the code,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.280
we're ready to make a change that might improve performance a bit.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.970
Remembering back to how prototype chains work,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.670
can you think of some way we might improve performance by

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.990
using prototype chains to achieve the same thing that this code achieves?

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.890
As a reminder the way prototypes work is any object can be

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.530
made to delegate its field property lookups to another object.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.570
So, for example in this situation, if Ben lacks a property, it's going to

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.659
delegate any field lookups for that property to Ben's prototype object.
