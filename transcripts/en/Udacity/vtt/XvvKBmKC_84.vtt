00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.810
Thank you for joining us today.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.760
&gt;&gt; Thanks It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.290
&gt;&gt; Let's get started.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.465
So given a 2D matrix,
m, of just 0s and 1s,

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:12.790
count the number of
islands in the matrix.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.140
In this case an island is just
a group of 1s or a 1 by itself.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.790
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're given a 2D matrix.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.726
Which would look something like this.

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:32.907
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:36.910
So what we're to do is we're
to find the number of islands.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.809
Where an island is
a group of 1s connected.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.698
But if 1s are connected diagonally,
does that constitute an island?

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:47.130
&gt;&gt; No, the 1s need to be
connected either horizontally or

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.800
vertically to count as an island.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.629
&gt;&gt; Okay, so

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.690
what we're really supposed to do is find
the number of islands in this matrix.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.320
Where an island is 1s connected
horizontally and vertically.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.290
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.790
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.620
&gt;&gt; All right, how do you think
our interview we did for

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.620
the first portion of the interview?

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.750
&gt;&gt; Well I think he didn't do too bad.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.410
You clarified the question to make sure
that he's solving the right problem.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.140
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.980
This is a very popular
interview question, so

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.890
there are different variations.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.140
It's important to make sure you're
solving the right variation.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
Some interviewers may consider 1s
connected diagonally to be an island.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.520
In general,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.369
clarifying a problem is crucial to
being a good software developer.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.740
You need to prove to your interviewer
that you won't dive head first into

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.759
a problem and

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.260
potentially waste time writing code
that doesn't solve the initial issue.
