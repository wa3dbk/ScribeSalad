00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.950
So now let me quickly summarize.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.540
Basically, I dug a little bit deeper
into the whole concept of feature

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.410
detection, and we discussed the
different types of invariants, to scale,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.310
to size, and to intensity and rotation.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.520
Basically went through in detail to
the Harris Corner detector framework and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.570
the SIFT detector, specifically
talking about issues with scale.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.360
And also shared with you some example
demos of how we can make this work.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.620
Again just for your reference there
are additional readings I encourage you

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.430
to look at them.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.530
And also just spend a little bit of
time look at information on features.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.480
The Open CV side this is one of
the harder areas in computer vision and

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.330
many people are writing specifically and
making it available on Open CV

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.150
to various applications of using
things like feature detection.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.930
You'll get to play around with
this a little bit more and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.560
again we'll be using this
approach extensively for

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.050
doing other things in
the next set of assignments.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.410
Now we will actually move to a few
additional examples, like for

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.360
example, image warping, morphing,
high dynamic range imaging and

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.290
panoramic imaging, in the next module.
