00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.100
Let's consider an example for max-min fair

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.610
allocation. Let's suppose that we have a link

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:14.270
with capacity ten and four demands. 2, 2.6, 4, and 5. Now, obviously the demands

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.150
exceed capacity. So we need to figure out a way of allocating rates to each of

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.440
these demands that is max-min fair. First, note that 10 divided by 4 is 2.5.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.330
But this is not a good solution, because

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.060
the first user only needs 2. So the first

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.300
user would have an excess of .5 under

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.730
this allocation. So what we want to do is take

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.970
this excess of .5 and divide it among

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.880
the remaining 3 users, whose demands have not yet

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.898
been fulfilled. This would yield an allocation of

00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:50.580
2, 2.67, 2.67 and 2.67. But now user 2

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.060
has an excess of 0.07, so we take that excess, divide it among

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.220
the remaining 2, and that gives us our final maximum fair allocation. Note that

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.140
this is called maximum fairness, because it

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.500
maximizes the minimum share to each user

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.140
whose demand is not fully serviced. In this case, the 3rd and 4th users.
