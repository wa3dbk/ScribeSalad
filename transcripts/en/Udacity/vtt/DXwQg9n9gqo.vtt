00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.547
When using matrices, the way we tell points from vectors is by putting a 1 or a

00:00:04.547 --> 00:00:08.690
0 for the last coordinate. This also works rather nicely as an operation check

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.366
when using point and vector math. For example, if we add 2 vectors, the fourth

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:18.185
coordinates add up to be 0, which means a vector. If we subtract 1 vector from

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:23.297
another, the same thing works out. The fourth coordinate is 0 so it's a vector.

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:28.035
If we had a point and a vector, we get a point because the fourth coordinate is

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:32.448
1. If we subtract 1 point from another we get a vector showing the movement

00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:36.494
needed to go from the second point to the first. This fourth coordinate also

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:41.032
acts as a way to check against doing illegal things. If you add two points, this

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:45.432
normally has no real meaning. The fourth coordinate is 2, which is a tip off

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:50.077
that something is not right. Now that we have this fourth coordinate, we can

00:00:50.077 --> 00:00:52.893
multiply points and vectors by a 4 by 4 matrix.
