00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.150
Another direct challenge is Pull,
automating the retrieval of data.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.532
So far we've only discuss the fax
machine replacement-use case where Dr.

00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:16.230
Johnson sends a patient chart to Dr.
Jones when he refers Marla to her.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.360
Suppose Dr. Jones wants
information from Dr. Johnson.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.235
Suppose Marla has started recording
her blood glucose readings at home and

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:31.090
Dr. Johnson wants to retrieve the most
recent ones to see how she's doing.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.160
Suppose Marla has established a personal
health record and wants it automatically

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.930
updated whenever there's new information
in any of her medical records.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.190
These are all examples of Pull,
where the recipient,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.180
not the sender, initiates the message.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330
Accomplishing this is
still in the future, but

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.810
a group of experts have proposed how
it might be done, as shown here.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.670
Using some new standards within
Direct for requesting information and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.870
sending back a response.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.800
This would be done using
specially formatted XML documents,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.260
similar to constructs that already
exist in quality reporting and

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.280
that we'll see in lesson eight.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.680
Another interesting aspect of this
proposal that's not specifically limited

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.910
to Direct is that all of
the patient's data would be stored

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.750
in a repository that would receive and
respond to these requests,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.200
presumably based on each patient's
information sharing preferences.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.450
Many people propose something like this
to simplify the privacy issues we'll

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.390
discuss in lesson four.
