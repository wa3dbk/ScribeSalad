00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
So let's have a look back at the laws of NP completeness,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.200
and the laws of NP completeness, of course, is a book that only holds unless P=NP.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.490
If anybody ever proves P=NP, then we can recycle this book here or delete the e-book.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.880
So what do the laws of NP completeness say--they say, "No polynomial algorithm."

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.970
So now it's time to think like lawyers and try to put loopholes into the statement here

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.390
and there's two loopholes that you can poke into this.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.320
One is that we only say, "No polynomial time." We do not say, "Exponential time."

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.390
What do I mean by that? Well, what about a running time like 2^√n.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.860
It's not exponential time--it's called sub-exponential because you don't have the n as it is

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.100
appear in the exponent, but it's also not polynomial time because you have

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.060
some function of n up here in the exponent.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.360
A running time like this actually conforms with the law and it has an excellent speedup.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.150
So let's think about this for a minute. Let's say n=50.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:09.490
If n=50, what is the speedup of 2^√n versus 2^n. Of course, we're going to do this as a quiz.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.140
Is it over a million, is it over a billion, or is it over a trillion.

00:01:14.140 --> 99:59:59.000
Of course, I only want you to select one answer here, the best possible one.
