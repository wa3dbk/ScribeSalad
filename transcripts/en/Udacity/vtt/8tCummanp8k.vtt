00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.500
Police and law enforcement officers are aware that our memories are malleable.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.019
And they've developed techniques when investigating crimes or accidents to help

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.604
diminish the possibility of false memories. One thing they do is to separate

00:00:12.604 --> 00:00:16.285
witnesses immediately so they cannot talk to each other. This way, what one

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:19.860
person remembers from an accident is not contaminated by what another person

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.247
remembers from an accident. Another thing they can do is to be careful with the

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:28.496
types of words they use to ask questions. For example, Elizabeth Loftus

00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:32.786
examined how the types of words that people use to ask questions can influence

00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:37.957
our memory of an event. For example, in one study participants were assigned to

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:42.494
different groups. Participants saw slides of pictures of cars that collided and

00:00:42.494 --> 00:00:45.718
they were asked to estimate how fast the vehicles were going, but they were

00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:51.038
asked in different ways. There were five conditions. The participants were

00:00:51.038 --> 00:00:55.408
asked to describe the car accident as if they were an eye witness. Participants

00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:58.648
were asked how fast a car was going when they hit each other, smashed each

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:03.775
other, bumped each other, collided with each other, or contacted each other.

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:07.185
Depending on which group they were in, they heard a different ending of the

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:11.332
sentence. A week after this, participants were asked if they saw any broken

00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:16.121
glass in the pictures on the slides. Participants in the smashed condition

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:20.882
reported the highest speeds. After that came collided, then bumped, then hit,

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:25.115
then contacted. And when they were asked about the glass, participants in the

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:29.993
smashed condition were more likely to say yes they saw glass in the pictures.

00:01:29.993 --> 00:01:33.287
So, here we see the type of question or type of word that is used to describe

00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:38.490
the accident. Influences the persons memory of the event and may actually

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.624
modify the persons memory. Again, this experiment demonstrates how easily our

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:47.788
memories can be changed. Our memories can be easily distorted by the type of

00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:52.387
question, and information that comes after an event. This can cause inaccurate

00:01:52.387 --> 00:01:54.779
recall or reconstructive memory.
