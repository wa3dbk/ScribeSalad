00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.830
Now when we know how to time
an operation an operation in

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.540
Python let's check how fast Num-Py is.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.460
Let's define a really large array so
that the time taken for

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.300
the operation will be
significant to compare.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.100
So here is our large array of
1,000 rows and 10,000 columns.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.720
Before I go ahead,
I would like to mention

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.490
that this is just a demo code
to show the speed of Num-Py.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.570
So, I will be giving a high
level explanation of this code.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.810
Moving ahead, we will be comparing
how to compute mean of the array

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.560
using Num-Py and
using standard iteration.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.630
Here is the manual mean function
which computes the mean of the values

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.240
in the defined area.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.540
We trade over each row, and for
each row it trade over each column.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.020
We then sum present all
the values throughout the array.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.840
Finally, we divide by the size of
the array and hence we get the mean.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.870
In case of using Num-Py for
calculating the mean,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.280
we just write array.mean to get
the mean of the entire array.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.250
How long function will just compute
the time each matter takes.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.260
Now, let's check what's
the time difference.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.060
Do you see the difference?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.440
This is the time taken by
the numpy.mean function

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.960
to calculate the mean
of the entire array.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.080
And remember the size of
the array are in thousands.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.260
On the other hand, the time taken by
the manual method is about 5 seconds.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.139
Hence proved, Num-Py is super fast.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.210
We also compute the rate of how fast
the Num-Py is and the numbers are crazy.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.218
It's about 290 times faster
than the manual for loops.

00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:47.840
Observe that Num-Py not only makes
the code more cleaner as compared

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.060
to the manual method, but there's about
290 times faster than other method.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.600
Don't you think it's just awesome?
