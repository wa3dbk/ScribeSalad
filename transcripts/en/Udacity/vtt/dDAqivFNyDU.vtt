00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.340
Let us briefly talk about evaluation in storage. These evaluation and

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.890
storage steps in analogical reasoning are very similar to the evaluation and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.850
storage steps in case based reasoning. Analogical reasoning by itself does not

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.870
provide guarantees of correctness. So the solution that it

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.560
proposes must be evaluated by some manner. For the down correlation problem, for

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.020
example, we may evaluate the proposed solution by doing a simulation.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.420
Once the evaluation has been done, then the new problem and a solution can be

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.750
encapsulated as a new case and stored back in memory for later potential reuse.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.430
To return to the down correlation problem, as an example. Once we

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.930
have the solution of decomposing the laser beam into several smaller beams and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.210
sending them to a tumor at the same time from different directions, we can do

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.760
a simulation of this solution and see whether they are successful. If it is,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.875
then we can encapsulate the target problem and the proposed solution as a case,

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:59.590
and store it in memory. It might be useful later. It could potentially become

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.990
a source case for a new target problem to come later. Once again,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.400
in this way, the AI agent learns incrementally. Each time it solves a problem,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.790
the new problem and its solution becomes a case for later reuse.
