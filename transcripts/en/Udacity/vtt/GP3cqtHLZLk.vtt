Le'ts change some materials on the drinking bird to make it look a bit more

00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:07.252
realistic. Change the following materials to use the Mesh Phong Material. The

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:11.878
Hat, Body, Leg, and Foot should all use this material. Assign the shininess, and

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.762
also assign the specular color to be this. Note that the specular color is

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:19.532
different than the material color. You should check the online documentation to

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:23.411
make sure you're setting the right color. When you're done, the results should

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:24.993
definitely look shinier like this.
