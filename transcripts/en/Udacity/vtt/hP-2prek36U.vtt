Completing the square here is easy since, well the square is already completed

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.372
for us, so I am not even going to bother using the quadratic formula all we need

00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:13.692
to do is modify the equations that it reads x minus 3 the quantity squared

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:18.372
equals negative 16 then we just take the square root of both sides And of course

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:22.746
we can't forget our plus or minus over here, on the right side. We can go

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:27.912
through the same steps as we did in the past couple of quizzes, to end up with x

00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:33.062
minus 3 equals plus or minus 4i. Now here, to get x by itself, we just need to

00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:37.991
add 3 to both sides. And we end up with a final answer of x equals 3, plus or

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:38.685
minus 4i.
