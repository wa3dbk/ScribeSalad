00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.610
What's the answer? How do you fix it? Well, it's

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.520
a hard problem, and there are many possible ways. And the

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.820
only way to know whether you provided a good one, is

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.430
to test it, to show it to other people, and see

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.610
if they understand how the home meter system works. That's

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.080
what the forum is for. Post your answers on the forum

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.230
and discuss it. See what other people come up with. See

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.760
how well your solution is understood, or what ideas you might

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.670
get from other people.
