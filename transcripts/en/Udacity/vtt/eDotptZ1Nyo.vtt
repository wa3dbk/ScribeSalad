00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I want to add a new attribute to our form, and this one is going to be called "method."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I go up here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's add method and make it equal post.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, the default method has been get.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We've talked about this in Unit 1, the difference between a couple methods,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so we mentioned that a couple methods exist,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and the most important ones are going to be using our get and post.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If you don't specify method at all, it defaults to get, and that's what we've been seeing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We've been doing get requests, and the parameters in the URL

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
are called get parameters.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now we're going to use a new method called "post,"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
so make this change, and let's go to our browser.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Okay, here we are at our familiar form again.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's type in some text and hit submit.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
When you clicked submit, what happened?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Was the text that we entered displayed?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
An error message was displayed?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The request headers were displayed, or we ran a Google search with our text request?
