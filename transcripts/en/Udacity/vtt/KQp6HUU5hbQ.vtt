00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690
Now, let's try to find a general rule for the number of ways that you can get from A to B.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.370
The number of vertices in each of the graphs that I have drawn is 4, 6, 8 and 10.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.920
When we have four vertices, there are two different ways to get from A to B.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.070
When we have six, there are four different ways. When we have eight, there are eight different ways.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.260
And when we have 10 vertices, there are 16 different ways to get from A to B.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.610
Now my question to you is what if we had 20 vertices

00:00:29.610 --> 99:59:59.000
and please again give your answer down here in this box?
