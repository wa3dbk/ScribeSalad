00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.860
I want to begin our discussion of linear
programming with the kind of problem

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.830
that you likely first encountered
in a high school Algebra class.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.430
A graduate student is trying to
balance work and relaxation.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.440
He finds that eating, sleeping, and

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.830
commuting leave him with
14 hours per day remaining.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.780
After two hours of work,
he finds that he needs to relax for

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.990
a half hour before he can work
effectively for another hour.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.810
His advisor,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.830
and probably his mother too,
want him to work as much as possible.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.430
We'll let x1 be the number of hours
spent working on research, and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.880
let x2 be the number of
hours spent relaxing.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.760
Then we can express this graduate
student's time management problem

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.800
as the following optimization.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.260
We express the fact that
he has only 14 hours for

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.070
these activities by saying
that x1 + x2 is at most 14 and

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.310
we express the fact that
he feels a need for

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.640
half as much relaxation as work after
two hours with this constraint here.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.480
Of course, he can't spend negative
time on either of these activities, so

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.100
we need to add that constraint as well.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
The overall goal is to maximize time
worked, so we make that our objective

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.300
function, and we want to maximize
that subject to these constraints.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.340
Now in high school,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.700
your teacher probably asked you to
begin by graphing the inequalities.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.770
When we do this,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.860
we see that the constraints
generate the following polytope.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.000
Perhaps your highschool teacher
didn't use the word polytope, but

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.170
that's what this region here is.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.640
Each constraint restricts the solution
to half of the plane that's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.050
called a half space, and the polytope
is an intersection of half space.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.590
After you graph the region,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.040
the solution can be picked
out as one of the vertices.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.780
In this case, it's pretty easy to
see that it's this one right here,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.480
which is the intersection
of these two constraints.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.470
Maybe if the formula was
a little more complicated,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.630
and you weren't sure, you could have
tested each one of the vertices and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690
picked the one with
the highest objective value.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.639
Why is the optimal solution
at one of the vertices?

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.280
Well, remember that in this problem, and
in all similar ones from high school,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.770
the objective function, that is,
the thing we're optimizing, is linear.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.450
The only thing that matters is how far
we can move in a certain direction.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.390
In this case, the x1 direction, but
it could be any direction in the plane.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.170
If you like, you can think of there
being a giant magnet infinitely far

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.130
away, pulling our point x in a certain
direction and trying to get it as close

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.990
as possible to the magnet, this point
must end up at one of the vertices.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.300
If some point of his interior
then we can clearly improve

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.710
by moving in this direction.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.730
If a point is on the edge, then we
can improve by moving along the edge.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.620
The only time we couldn't
improve in this way

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.530
would be if the edge were perpendicular
to the direction we wanted to move in.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.990
Maybe the magnet is actually up here and
thus it would turn out that

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.240
this point here,
in the middle of the edge, is optimal.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.460
But then actually both vertices
on either side of this edge

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.320
are optimal too.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.680
So if we just want a optimal solution,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.090
it always suffices to just
look at the vertices.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.520
Thinking more abstractly,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.960
there isn't always an optimal solution,
as there is in this particular case.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.860
If I eliminate this constraint here,
like so,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.480
our polytope is unbounded in
the gradient direction of our objective.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.810
In this case, we can just keep
moving our point x further and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.420
further getting greater and
greater values for objective function.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.630
You give me an x, I've got a better one,
hence there's no optimal solution.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.640
On the other hand if I put
back that constraint and

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.310
add another one, we might find
that they are contradictory.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.990
There's no way to satisfy them all.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.920
If there are no solutions,
there can't be an optimal one.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.290
So those are the three
things that can happen.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.950
The constraints can create
a bounded region and

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.640
we find an optimum inside of there.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.420
The region can be unbounded
in which case it's possible

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.310
that there in no optimum
solution because for

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.790
any solution there is always a better
one or the region that satisfies

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.610
all the constraints can be empty in
which case there is no solution at all.
