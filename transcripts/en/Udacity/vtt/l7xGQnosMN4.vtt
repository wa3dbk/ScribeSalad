00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now all that's left is to set up this matrix bonus, say where the double and triple bonuses are.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Here's what I've done. I've just drawn a picture of the bonus and I called it the bonus_template.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But I only drew one quadrant, one quarter of the board, because I noticed that they were all

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
symmetric and so this function bonus_template takes a quadrant in terms of a string,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
mirrors each rows and then mirrors each set of rows,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where mirror of a sequence is just sequence plus the rest of the sequence

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
except for the last one, so there's going to be a middle piece that we'll reflect it around.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I made one template for the Scrabble game and one for the Words With Friends game,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then you choose which bonus you want to use, and then I defined these constants for

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
double words, triple words, double letters, and triple letters, and I wasn't quite sure what to use.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I know I didn't want to use letters like d and t because I'd get confused with the letters in the hand.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I used 2 and 3 for double and triple words, a colon because it has 2 dots for double letters,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and a semicolon because it's a little bit bigger than a colon for triple letters.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Even though we're so close to the end, it's still good hygiene to write tests,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so I took some time to write some, ran them, all the tests pass.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You can see here's a tiny little bonus template--a quarter of an array, which looks like that.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When you apply bonus_template to it, you get this nice symmetric array.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now what I'd like you to do is modify the show(board) function so that it prints out

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
these bonus entries so that if there's no letter over this 3 in the corner

00:01:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
it should print the 3 rather than just printing a dot.
