00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.260
let's say it takes me one minute to go

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.786
from my office to the classroom, but the hallway is

00:00:06.786 --> 00:00:11.110
wide enough that five of us can walk side-by-side going

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.530
to my office to the classroom. So the question to

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.690
you is to illustrate the difference between latency and

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.560
throughput. The question is, what is the latency incurred by

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.620
me to get to the classroom? And the second part

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.780
of the question is asking you, what is the throughput

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.010
achieved if I walk with four other

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.970
students side-by-side to get to the classroom?
