00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.258
I know that you've been absolutely dying to see the graph of our famous

00:00:03.258 --> 00:00:07.930
reverberation time function. So here it is, now notice that I've ignored the

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.159
restrictions brought on by the application. That's going to let us look at the

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.146
function as a whole. Otherwise we'd only be looking at these positive values of

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:20.645
x, and that wouldn't be quite as interesting. What are the domain and the range

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:25.320
of the entire function T? I've given you 2 options for each. You can either say

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.792
that the domain of the range is all the real numbers, or you can say that it's

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:34.345
all the real numbers, except for certain values. If you pick the second option,

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:39.099
I'd like you to fill in those values that either X or T cannot equal.
