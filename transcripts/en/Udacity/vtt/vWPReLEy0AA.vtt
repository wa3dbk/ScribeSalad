00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.689
But first let us look at examples of the three kinds of semantic categories that

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.250
by point to. So here is a sentence in which by points to an agent. That

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.820
was written be Ashok. Actually, this particular sentence was written by David.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.990
The second sentence, David went to New York by train, here by is pointing to

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.060
a conveyance. David stood by the statue. Here, by it is pointing to a location.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.700
By the statue. So the use of the word by helped us, in that it

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.950
constrained the interpretation of Ashok to either an agent, conveyance or

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.260
location. It by itself doesn’t tell us whether Ashok is an agent or

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.550
a conveyance or location. We need some additional knowledge. Let us suppose that

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.510
the agent has an ontology of the world. The term ontology initially comes from

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.620
philosophy where it means the nature of reality. An artificial intelligence

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.190
determine ontology often reference to the conceptualization of the world.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.990
The categories and terms of which I specify the world.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.349
These categories have become the vocabulary of the knowledge representation. So

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.580
let us supposed that the agent has this ontology of the world.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.240
The world is composed of things, and things can be agents or objects or

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.350
locations. Agents are people, and Ashok and David are examples of agents.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.470
Objects can be conveyances. And trains and cars are examples of conveyances.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.820
Obviously this is a very small part of someone's ontology about the world.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.800
Now this ontology helps us decide that Ashok, in the first sentence,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.050
is an agent. Let's see how. Here we have by Ashok, and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.450
we know from the prepositional constraints that by can refer to an agent,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.050
conveyance, or location. So the question now becomes, is Ashok an agent,

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.970
Ashok a conveyance, or Ashok a location? We can look into this ontology.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.790
Ashok is people, which is an agent. So now we know,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.970
that Ashok must be an agent. Similar the second sentence. Train can be an agent,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.440
conveyance or location. Let's look at our ontology. A train is a conveyance. So

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.470
now we know the train is a conveyance. Similarly for statue.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.730
Statue in this case specifies a location. Note that this analysis applies to

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.479
different prepositions, not just to by. Supposing this first sentence was,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.840
That was written with Ashok. In which case, this preposition with will point to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.440
Ashok either being a coagent or being an instrument. So again,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.130
we now know that Ashok is a coagent in the sentence which

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.530
contain the preposition with. There is another important thing to note here.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.500
Initially, when we were give this sentence, David went to New York by train,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.010
we started doing bottom-up processing. David was a noun, went was a verb. But

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.790
pretty soon we shifted to top-down processing. As an example,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.630
you already have this background knowledge, and this background knowledge tells

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.480
us in a top-down manner that by, here, can refer to an agent, a conveyance, or

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.450
a location. We also have this additional background knowledge, and

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.660
this background knowledge tells us that in this particular sentence.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.830
The train describes frame to a conveyance, because train is a conveyance in this

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.030
ontology. So low-level bottom up processing generates queues,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.670
which access probes into memory. Memory then returns knowledge like this,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.570
and the processing becomes top down. The top down processing tells us how to

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.700
interpret the various words in this sentence, how to make sense of this story.
