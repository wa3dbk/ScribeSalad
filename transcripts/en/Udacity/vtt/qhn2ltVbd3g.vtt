00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.920
When we draw on a computer
all we're really doing

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.440
is assembling an array of colors.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.070
If you've ever looked at your computer
monitor under a magnifying glass

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.440
you've probably noticed that each pixel
is actually three vertical rectangles.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.080
One red, one green and one blue.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.890
And yet, when you take away the
magnifying glass the pixel can look like

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.420
any color at all.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.000
Pretty weird right?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.910
This works because the human eye isn't
as good as distinguishing colors as you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.150
might think.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.549
Our eyes can't actually tell the exact
energy of an incoming photon.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.240
So here's our eyeball and here's
the cornea and here's the retina and

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.220
here's the optic nerve.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.440
Now the actual sensors in the eye
are three types of cone cells.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.270
And each of these type of
cone cells collects photons

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.830
of a particular range of wavelengths.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.460
If a photon falls in the range of the l,
or

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.310
long wavelength cone cell,
our brain perceives it as red.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.680
If the wavelength is a little shorter,
and it falls into an m, or

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.310
medium cone cell, then it looks green.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.510
And, if the photon has a super-short
wavelength and stimulates the s cone,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.310
it appears blue.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.350
All other colors are just
how our brain interprets

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.190
photons that stimulate multiple
types of cone cells at once.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.330
Since red, green, and
blue light each directly stimulate

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.700
one of the types of cone cells, this
means we can simulate any other color

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.390
by replicating how that color
would simulate the cone cells.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.290
For instance the color yellow is the
results of stimulating both the l and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.810
the m cones, but

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.870
it doesn't matter to our brain
exactly what photons were involved.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.450
It could be a yellow laser where every
photon has exactly the same energy.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.720
Or it could be an even combination
of green and red light.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.990
The response of the l and
m cones is the same either way.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.880
So to our brain, it's the same color.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.270
The unintuitive result is that any
visible color can be generated by

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.000
a combination of red, green, and blue.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.050
Human color vision is a crazy topic.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.000
