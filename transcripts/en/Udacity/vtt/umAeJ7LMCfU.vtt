00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we saw a lot of confusion in the forums about what was going on

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
with this gradient descent.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The equations that were given to you were presented as a black box,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I'd like to open up that black box and see what's going on inside.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For those of you who looked at Wikipedia to try to understand what's going on

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with gradient descent, the first formula you would have encountered was this one.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This equation describes gradient descent.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now this is a little intimidating at first.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What do all of these parameters mean?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
b = a - gamma x the gradient of the function of valued at a.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's figure out what's going on here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Before we get into gradient descent, let's first answer the question,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what is a gradient?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
To help me answer this question, I'm going to get the help of my blindfolded hill climber.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Here's our blindfolded hill climber, and he's climbing this rounded hill.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He wants to get to the top, and he wants to do it in as few steps as possible.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What is his method going to be?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, as long as the hill is steep, he knows he can afford to take a really big step

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
because he's still not really close to the top.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
As the hill smoothes out and becomes more level, he's going to want to take

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
smaller and smaller steps because he's going to be afraid of overshooting the top

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and winding up on the other side of the hill.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
How can we describe this mathematically?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The way we're going to do that is by

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
using the gradient, and when we do that, our climber is going to get to the top of the hill.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Let's look at this hill from a top-down view, instead of from the side.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm going to draw these isocline, so these lines all represent lines of the same altitude.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We can see they come together.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
They're really close together in the beginning and become further and further apart

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
as we go inside, and that's because the hill is getting less and less steep.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So at any point, the gradient is a vector.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If I took the gradient at, let's say, this point.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I would get a vector pointing in the direction of steepest descent,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and the length of that vector would depend on exactly how steep the hill is.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So at this point, which maybe corresponds to somewhere down here on the hill,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the hill is quite steep, so our vector is quite long,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and it points directly uphill.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
If I was over here and taking the gradient, I would still be pointing uphill,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
but the vector wouldn't be quite as long now

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because now we're up here, and the slope isn't so great,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and with reduced slope comes reduced gradient and a reduced step size

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
for our blindfolded hill climber.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Gradient descent is very similar to blindfolded hill climbing.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now instead of climbing up a hill, we're climbing into a valley and trying to find the bottom of it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because we want to minimize a function.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That minimization is encoded in this - sign so instead of adding the gradient,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
we're going to subtract it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Let's talk about what each of these variables mean.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
A is our current position.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
If we were the hill climber, it would be right here where he starts off.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
B is going to be his next position so this is how the hill climber decides where to go next.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This gradient term tells us the direction of steepest ascent.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
This - sign flips that around. It says okay, let's actually find the direction of steepest descent.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This gamma is just a waiting factor.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
That's all this formula is doing.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's saying, let's take a step down the hill and use that as our new equation--

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
our new position. Sorry.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Now to elaborate on this, we're going to need to use a little bit of calculus,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
so if you don't know calculus, don't be intimidated.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Try your best to follow along, and if you can't, that's okay too.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I think this captures the essence of what's going on with gradient descent.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
First, we have to figure out what exactly is the function we're trying to minimize.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
For the purposes of the lecture, the function we're trying to minimize

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.000
was a function of yi, and it was equal to some waiting alpha x xi - yi squared,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
+ some waiting beta x yi - yi +1 squared,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
so the next y coordinate,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and we also do the same for the previous y coordinate,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
so yi - 1.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We want to minimize this, and we're going to use gradient descent.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Well, gradient descent says that, we should just iterate over this process until we get

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to a sufficiently shallow slope that we're confident are in the bottom.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We've really found a minimum.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So at each step, we're going to follow this.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
B, our new location becomes yi prime.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That's going to equal our old location, yi, and then - this gradient,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and the gradient here is just going to be the derivative with respect to yi.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
If you don't know calculus again, don't worry about it, and if you do,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
this is a fairly simple derivative.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I'm going to writie it simplified. I'm not going to show you all the intermediate steps.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But once we do this out, we find that yi prime = yi + 2 alpha x (xi - yi) + 2B(yi + 1 + yi - 1 - 2yi).

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This almost, almost looks like the equation that you were given in class.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
There's a little problem, and that's these 2s.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I'm going to do something where I just erase them.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You may be saying, hey, you're not allowed to do that,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but let's just pretend I'd originally called these parameters alpha over 2 and beta over 2,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
then everything will work out just fine.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
That's gradient descent.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
That's where this occasion comes from in our update step.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
This would be simultaneous update.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Another good way of using gradient descent.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's not how we implement it in lectures, but that's okay.

00:05:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I hope this was helpful. Good luck!
