00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.809
Now, note that once an object is being created in the environment, the

00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:06.025
PhysicsEngine will simulate each frame, updating the position and velocity of

00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:10.684
any physics bodies that it has in its world. In order for GRITS objects to

00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:14.268
properly receive the data and update positions for the rendering, we need to

00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:19.770
query the PhysicsEngine results by the physics bodies created for an entity.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.034
Note that the position values for an object already exists as it's inherited

00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:27.000
from our entity base class. Inside of our update loop, given that the entity

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.055
has a physical body, we can query it's position and update the entity position

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:34.368
accordingly. This way the visual representation of an object will match the

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:38.284
physical representation as is. To do this, you need to call the physics body's

00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:42.099
GetPosition method and then assign it to our local positional values.
