00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's say Monty picks a door and he picks door number 3

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
as indicated by these bars over here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Put differently, because Monty picks door number 3

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
all the other cases of picking door number 1 or 2

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
now have 0 probability.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let me just cross them out.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The only events that remain in the truth table are this one, this one, and this one.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here the true location of the car is door 1, door 2, and door 3.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Unfortunately, these numbers don't add up to 1.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They are a 1/3, 1/6, and 0.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want you to tell me what the true posterior probability is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
for the true location to be 1, 2, or 3.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please write those numbers down over here.
