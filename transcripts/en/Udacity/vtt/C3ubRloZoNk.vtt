00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.130
So what we now do in these
types of processes is

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.300
basically kind of start looking
at scales at different octaves.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.390
And this is one of the reasons we
looked at the whole concept of doing

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.680
this kind of analysis at
different pyramid levels,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.050
because each one of them
is a different octave.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.900
And now we can actually
start modeling the signal,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.670
and now we can actually start doing all
of the processing and what of course

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.610
comes out is the different scales we
can actually have these Gaussians, and

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.830
stuff like that, and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.320
using these Gaussians, we can also start
looking at differences of Gaussians.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.990
Again, very similar concept to what
we have done when we did some of

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.480
the blending using the frequency domain.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.170
Basically, look at
these types of things,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.900
you can see is that we now
actually can do the pyramids and

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.860
start looking at information
at different scales.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.970
This basically shows us how we can
actually do the different Gaussians that

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.810
I was showing you before
between different scales.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.680
And using that,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.510
we can find the extrema points,
which are all these examples here.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.990
Of course, what we want to do now is
find a few specific extrema points.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.400
So, of course, we would now kind of find
all the points that have high contrast

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.090
and that starts giving me more features.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.530
There's a lot more features here and, of
course, now I've started reducing them.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.490
And then I get rid of all of that are
not edges, just the corner features and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.500
I get even less number of points.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890
And this starts kind of giving
me the features that I want.
