00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, we have all the ingredients to that model of a wildfire.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The heat equation in 2D to describe the diffusion of heat. We have a model for heat loss.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We can describe the effect of wind at least in one dimension, but that would be easy to generalize

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to two dimensions, and we have a simple model for combustion.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In the homework, you're going to put all of these together to model a wildfire.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This boils down to adding the different contributions to a rate of change of temperature.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is what the result could look like.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In the region where the fire has started, the wood is depleted so they can't be any combustion going on.

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The fire has advanced to the right, a little to the left, and to the top.
