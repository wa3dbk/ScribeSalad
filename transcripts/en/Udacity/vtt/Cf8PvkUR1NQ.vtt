00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.344
These two alternative hypotheses are one-tailed tests. If our sample mean lies

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:08.704
out here in the critical region, significantly higher than the current

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:12.400
population mean, then we're guessing that the population parameter after the

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.241
intervention will be greater than the current. Similarly, if our sample mean

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:22.230
lies in the critical region below the current population parameter, the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.177
population parameter with the intervention will have a lower score than it does

00:00:26.177 --> 00:00:32.337
currently. And finally, if our sample mean lies in the critical region either

00:00:32.337 --> 00:00:36.692
higher or lower than the current population parameter, then we conclude that

00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:43.132
the new population will be significantly different. We choose a one-tailed, or

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:46.914
directional hypothesis test when we predict a direction of the treatment

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:52.206
effect. For example, when we predict that a song illustrating the concepts in

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:57.322
this lesson, will increase or decrease engagement. Alternatively, we would

00:00:57.322 --> 00:01:01.402
choose a two-tailed, or non-directional hypothesis test, when we do not predict

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:06.760
a direction of the treatment effect. In general we use two-tailed tests because

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.894
they are more conservative. We are less likely to reject the null when it's

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:15.240
true. We'll get more into that later. But also because, as you saw before, we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.463
might be wrong about the direction. We might predict that the treatment's going

00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:22.697
to increase engagement, when in fact it decreases engagement, in which case we

00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:27.140
should have a two-tailed test. If we just use the one-tailed test in the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.500
positive direction, we may miss the fact that the treatment is doing the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.615
opposite of what we would expect. One exception to this general rule is when

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:40.262
we're comparing a new treatment with an established treatment. In such cases,

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:44.487
we often only care if the new treatment is better than the old one. We don't

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:48.579
care if the new one is much worse. So that's when we would use a one-tailed

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.913
directional test.
