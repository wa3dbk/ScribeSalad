00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.030
Let me actually now start giving
you more details about what coded

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.380
photography could mean.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.770
Here, I'm basically just
showing you a single image,

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.400
one photograph of basically some
bottles, some cans, and a pack of chips.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.050
If I just take this one picture, what
I'd like to be able to get out of this

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.590
is basically some sort of a depth map.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.599
Now, we've looked at how
to compute depth, and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.840
we've talked about how to compute depth
by taking two images, a stereo pair.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.960
And we can compute something like this.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.274
Imagine in one image,
we can actually now decode it,

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:34.223
to be able to get information that gives
you depth in some detail like this.

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:38.844
Another example we can play with
is where just the same single

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:43.580
input image can allow us to now
compute a all-focused image.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.910
Everything in this, er, all layers of
this image are now completely focused.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.950
Here you can see a little bit
of blurriness in this image,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.550
because of defocusing.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.290
Or you know,
some of this is also defocused.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.690
But here each and every part when
you cans see there are multiple

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.640
layers of this one all are focused.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.160
You can basically look at a little bit
of close ups, see what I mean by this.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.405
More detail,
more crispness at all levels here,

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:07.579
this one is of course defocused.
