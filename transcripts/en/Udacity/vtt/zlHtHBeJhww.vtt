00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.240
Well, remember that the degrees of freedom is n minus one, so our degrees of

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.798
freedom is 29, so if we bring up the t table, we look for degrees of freedom is

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:18.930
29, and we also know that if alpha equals 0.05 for a two tailed test. Then

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.702
0.025 is in each tail. So we look for where it says the tail probability is

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:32.386
0.025. At 29 degrees of freedom, we get 2.045 as our t critical value. That

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:37.726
means that negative 2.045 is the t critical value that cuts off the lower

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:39.626
0.025.
