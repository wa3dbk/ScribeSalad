00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.650
Okay, let's look at a couple more operators. I'm going to switch over

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.830
and use the Mongo shell for some of this. This is a

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.119
console application that ships with the database, and it provides a great

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.330
interface for exploring MongoDB's query language. So, the first thing that I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.120
need to do is switch into the right database which I've already

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.836
done here with use examples. Now I'm just going to do a find

00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:21.146
against the whole collection and we see a whole bunch of documents

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:25.388
scroll by. Okay, so as we've discussed, some documents will contain fields

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:29.270
that others do not. In our cities' collection, for many

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.560
cities, especially those that are less important or simply smaller, much

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.588
of the detail is missing. For example, a small town

00:00:35.588 --> 00:00:37.830
in the U.S. state of Iowa where I used to live

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.190
is going to have much less detail than let's say

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.543
Berlin, London, or other major cities. Mongo DB allows you to

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:47.503
query based on the structure of information that's in the documents,

00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:50.410
as well as their values. So let's take a look at

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.630
an example. So I happen to know that relatively few

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.470
documents have a field for government type. It's useful to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.850
know what type of government a particular city has, but

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.960
it's only the larger cities that tend to have this

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.870
field. MongoDB provides an operator called Exists that allows us

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.790
to retrieve documents based on whether or not documents contain

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.450
a particular field. And the value for Exists is whether

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.330
we want documents that contain the field, or those that don't.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.890
In this case, I want to find documents that do

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.630
have a governmentType field. Oop and you see what

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.430
happened there is I forgot to close the query

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.750
document. So, let's go back and do that, and there

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.350
we go. And let's do a count here. And

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.550
of the 20,000 documents in this collection, a relatively

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.520
small number contain this field. We can do the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.010
inverse query and see we get a much larger number.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.140
Let's take a look at one of these documents. Here

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.180
I'm going to use pretty to make it more human readable.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.570
Okay, so let's go back to the documents that actually

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.680
contain this field. And again I'll make em pretty. Okay,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.770
so this happens to be the city of Lansing, Michigan,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.230
and you can see there's a quite a bit of

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.770
detail here. Okay. Now, what we can do is contrast

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.180
this with documents that don't have this field, and it just

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.930
happens to be the case that this document

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.470
is conveniently, for example purposes, much more sparse. So

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.830
the Exists Operator allows us to do queries and

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.970
asks some questions about the structure of a document.
