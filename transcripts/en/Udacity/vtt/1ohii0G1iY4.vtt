00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.630
The answer is 1965- 7-14. Here's how we would calculate this using Java

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.950
Objects. We would create a Day object and specify the year, month and day as

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:20.240
November 28th, 1964. If we use the two string method. Shows us what's in this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.960
Day object right now, which is exactly what we entered. November 18th, 1964.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:34.673
And then we can add days. That's the flight time. And now, this object has July

00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:44.920
14th, 1965. So that's the arrival date. As a side note, this format is an

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.480
international standard called ISO 8601. It was chosen for good computer science

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.250
reasons. There needed to be a standard form used by all the different countries

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.080
so that data stored in computers could be transferred across borders. They put

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.445
the year first so that when you sort a date sort of alphabetically or

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:05.150
lexicographically, don't have to know that word, it's okay. The dates will show

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.605
up in chronological order.
