00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.370
Now let's go back to the distinguishing aspects of

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.710
RUP, starting from the first one. That is, that the

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.170
rational unified process is use-case driven. So let's see what

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.310
that means. Generally speaking, we can see a system as

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.500
something that performs a sequence of actions in response to

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.100
user inputs. So the user submits some requests, or requests

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.140
some functionality, and the system responds to those requests. Use

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.750
cases, as we just said, capture exactly this interaction and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.620
answer the question, what is the system supposed to do

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.150
for each user? So, this is a very important point.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.160
So they can represent what a system can do for

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.240
each of the different types of users of the system.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.430
For this reason, and as we will see in more

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.430
detail, in the rational unified process, use cases are a

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.680
central element of the whole development life cycle. From requirements

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.360
engineering, all the way through the process until testing and maintenance.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.620
So, once more, use cases are used to support and

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.162
help each one of these phases in the rational unified process.
