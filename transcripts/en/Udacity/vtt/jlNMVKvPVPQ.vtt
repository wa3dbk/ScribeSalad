00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:03.964
So one way we could do this operation is to allocate the maximum space per element.

00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:08.985
In this case we would create an output array with 5 output triangles per input triangle.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.369
And we're going to put these in an intermediate array and then compact the result.

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.196
However, this has 2 significant disadvantages.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:17.759
The first is that it's really wasteful in space.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.584
We've now allocated an intermediate array that has the maximum amount of space per element,

00:00:22.584 --> 00:00:25.475
and that's going to lead to a very large array overall.

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:29.682
The second disadvantage is that now we have to scan this large intermediate array,

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:32.782
and that's not going to be as efficient as we would like either.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.993
So how can we do this more efficiently?

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:37.180
So let's go back to what we'd really like to do.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.021
What we'd like to do is have a list of allocation requests, 1 per input element,

00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.627
and then get back a location to write your requests.

00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:50.894
As an example, let's say we have 8 input triangles here, and those 8 triangles want to generate,

00:00:50.894 --> 00:00:57.496
in order, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, and 0 triangles.

00:00:57.496 --> 00:00:59.503
So what's that going to look like?

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:05.527
The first input element is going to want to write its 1 triangle here into the output array.

00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:09.471
The second triangle isn't going to have any output elements to write.

00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:15.922
The third input triangle is wanting to write into this element here. The next triangle has 2 outputs.

00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:18.456
It will write them into the next 2 slots of the array.

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:23.059
The next triangle wants to write its output here. The next triangle wants to write nothing.

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:29.331
The next triangle wants to write its output into these 3 output slots.

00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:33.938
So what we want to generate here is the output addresses for these.

00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:39.847
He wants to write his output into address 0. He wants to write his output into address 1.

00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:43.947
He wants to write his output into address 2 and 3.

00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:49.253
And this guy wants to write his output into addresses 5, 6, and 7, and so on.

00:01:49.253 --> 00:01:52.761
And look. This is exclusive scan as well.

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.217
It generalizes what we did with compact.

00:01:55.217 --> 00:02:00.959
In compact we allocated 1 slot in the output array for each true element and 0 for each false element.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.504
Instead, now we've generalized this so that we simply indicate in the input array

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:07.725
the exact number that we need.

00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:09.725
This is simpler and it's more efficient.

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:14.304
Instead of scanning an array that has the maximum possible allocation for all elements--

00:02:14.304 --> 00:02:17.672
in the case of clipping, 5 times the size of the input array--

00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:21.544
now we just have to scan something the size of the input array.

00:02:21.544 --> 00:02:23.783
So it's more efficient to be able to do it this way.

00:02:23.783 --> 00:02:26.396
So that's a couple of interesting applications of scan.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.603
If you're doing any sort of GPU programming with irregular workloads,

00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:32.342
you'll find that scan comes up all the time.

00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:36.176
Recent work has used scan in diverse application domains, such as graft reversal,

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:39.539
data compression, and collision detection, among many others.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:45.208
And we'll see later in this lecture that scan is the core of the fastest GPU sort as well.
