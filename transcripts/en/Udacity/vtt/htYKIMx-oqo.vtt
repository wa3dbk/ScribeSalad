00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.643
Our old app is currently 30% Swift and
70% Objective-C.

00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:09.611
So we had a lot of Objective-C
code that was interopting to Swift

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:11.544
with the Swift headers.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:16.687
And a lot of the time because of
implicitly unwrapped optionals,

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:21.457
we would expect some variables
to be non-nil but because for

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:24.168
some reason or for some edge case,

00:00:24.168 --> 00:00:29.526
we had a nil parameter passed through
that would cause lots of bugs.

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:32.540
And I think we had thousands and
thousands of crashes in our current app

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.980
because of that interop
issue in general.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.928
And that's actually one of the reasons
we decided that like going 100%

00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:43.540
Swift is important for
both our developer happiness,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.700
because this is a much nicer code
base to work with, but also for

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.180
the happiness of our users, who will
be able to use a more robust product.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.876
So the most common interoperability
ability challenge I've encountered

00:00:57.876 --> 00:01:01.007
is when I'm going from
Swift to Objective-C, so

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.739
my Objective-C code is
consuming my Swift code.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.690
And the challenge I face is that all the
time my Swift code, it includes structs

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.000
and enums and other constructs that
are specific to Swift only, so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.010
it's very difficult, or actually Xcode
doesn't make it possible at all to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.950
create headers for those in Objective-C.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.350
And in order to have your Objective-C
code consume that's that Swift code,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.850
you have to create like wrapper classes
that kind of shim your code from Swift

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.680
to Objective-C, which leads to like more
lines of code, more files of code, and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.330
more complexity, which was probably
one of the larger reasons as to why we

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.683
decided to do a rewrite where we
don't run into issues like this.

00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:45.600
After we completed our nullability
audit, it wasn't completely smooth

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.240
sailing, because we realized that our
nullability audit actually exposed some

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.530
bad practices that we were doing
in our Objective-C code base,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.640
because sometimes things that shouldn't
be nil ever, we were setting to nil,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.160
just not realizing that we were.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.760
But thankfully, with Apple's toolkit
they've given us with Objective-C,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.156
and when they introduced
the nullability audit,

00:02:08.156 --> 00:02:11.370
so the ability to do them, they'll
give you warnings every time you set

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.680
something to nil that's
not supposed to be nil.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.860
And that was helpful in us improving
the quality of our code base,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.630
making it more robust by
removing those warnings,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.950
by making sure we'd never set those
values to nil, or if they should be nil,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.190
by making sure that we
make them nullable.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.139
There were actually no features that
were especially difficult to port from

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.120
Objective-C to Swift.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.950
And that's because porting anything
from the Objective-C to Swift

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.710
is relatively straightforward.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.061
Because Objective-C, when you went
from Objective-C to Swift, like,

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:47.610
all the constructs that exist in
Objective-C also exist in Swift.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.830
So you can literally just go
from a syntactical change

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.810
from Objective-C to Swift.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.460
The point of our rewrite, though, was
not to port the code like one to one,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.800
it was to make architectural decisions
that led to a more robust code base.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.399
And that meant a lot of whiteboarding.

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.633
There were multiple correct solutions,
but probably one best solution.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:07.959
So it meant a lot of like
just meeting as a team and

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.064
figuring out what that
best solution was.

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:14.981
And that's where I think
our brains worked the most.

00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:20.950
And it was an engaging, but
also a difficult problem to solve.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.160
So for the most part,
if I was writing a new app,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.090
I would write it 100% in Swift, because

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.320
almost all the features that exist
in Objective-C also exist in Swift.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.468
That said, if I wanted to do something
crazy like method swizzling,

00:03:36.468 --> 00:03:41.628
I think because Objective-C's a dynamic
language, I would do it in Objective-C.

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:44.982
That said, I don't think I'd ever
be doing method swizzling if

00:03:44.982 --> 00:03:46.917
I'm doing something the right way.

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:51.747
So I would probably go 100% Swift and
maybe some Objective-C dependencies if

00:03:51.747 --> 00:03:56.227
it made my life easier, but write my
main product in Swift, because it gives

00:03:56.227 --> 00:04:00.147
you all the powers of map and
flat map and generics and structs, and

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:04.910
value types, which is very powerful
that Objective-C just doesn't give you.
