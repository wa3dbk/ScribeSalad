00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.547
What's happening in these two functions is something totally new for us. For

00:00:03.547 --> 00:00:07.323
each one, we get a value of x that's not allowed right in the middle of the

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:14.228
domain. What does this actually mean? Well, here's the graph of one of the two

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:19.705
functions we were just working with f of x equals 1 over 3x. What do you notice

00:00:19.705 --> 00:00:23.983
about the behavior of the graph just before x equals 0, so to the left of the y

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:29.710
axis and just after x equals 0, to the right of the y axis?
