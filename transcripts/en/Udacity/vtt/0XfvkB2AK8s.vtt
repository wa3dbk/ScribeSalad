00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.075
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Solving for x, we get x equals 24 for this equation, and x equals 28 for this

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:10.017
equation. Interestingly enough, these are the x-coordinates of the two

00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:15.383
x-intercepts of our graph. So remember what we actually did? We started off by

00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:20.812
picking out 0 as the y value for which we wanted to find corresponding x values.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:25.482
On this parabola. Plugging in that value for y, or in other words substituting

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:29.969
in 0 in the place of y in the equation, we solve for x. To get the corresponding

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:34.582
x coordinates at the various points on the graph where the y coordinate is 0. So

00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:40.534
the reason that we have two answers here is because there are two points on the

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:44.596
graph, 4,0 and 28,0 that are the same Y value of zero.
