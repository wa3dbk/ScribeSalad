Nice work, now I think ordering
methods can actually be used

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.630
to solve another issue.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.790
Here take a look.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.120
When I start shopping mode and
I buy something, it crosses it off,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.980
which is great.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.180
But what would be even more great
is if when I cross an item off,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.580
it could actually be in
a different part of the list.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.780
So maybe down here I would have all
the items that I've already bought and

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.700
separated up here it would be the items
that haven't been bought yet.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.640
I have a feeling that
using a sorting query

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.940
you could separate out the bought
items from the un-bought items.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.600
I'll go ahead and send over the spec
which outlines exactly what I want, and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.570
maybe you can take a stab at it.
