00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.932
Since most calculators, including the one I'm going to use, have buttons for

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:07.644
log base ten and natural log, I've shown you two ways that you can could pretty

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:13.702
easily figure out how to evaluate log base four of 121. If we want to convert

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:18.118
it to something involving log base ten, it would become log base 10 of 121 over

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:23.794
log base 10 of 4. If instead, you wanted to use natural log, it would become

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:28.642
natural log of 121 over natural log of 4. Plugging this into a calculator gives

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:34.834
us the same thing for each one. Rounding, we get about 3.459 for both. That

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:40.114
means that x is about equal to 3.459. Awesome. We solved an exponential

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:40.839
equation.
