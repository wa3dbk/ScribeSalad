00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.880
So that's sort of EM at the level of

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.290
the equations, but I thought it would be helpful

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.400
to actually implement it and kind of mess around

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.450
a little bit. So do you want to see what happens?

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.570
&gt;&gt; I would love to see what happens.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.520
&gt;&gt; So I generated some data here,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.670
which comes actually from two different Gaussian

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.310
clusters. One that's centered over hereish, and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.630
one that's centered over hereish. [LAUGH] Just not

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.820
to be too specific about it, but you can sort of see that there's two

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.590
clouds of points, right? One in the upper left and one in the lower right.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.210
Can you see it?

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.030
&gt;&gt; The one in the lower right looks like

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.810
a clown. I think it's a little bit more of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.900
a superhero but that's that's not the point. The point

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.470
is, is that it's just a bunch of random points.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.001
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.970
&gt;&gt; That's the point. It's a random point, but it is a point.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.630
&gt;&gt; So, your point is that the points are randomly pointed.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just want to point out that at random.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.130
&gt;&gt; I see your point.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.600
&gt;&gt; And, so, what I want to do now is run

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.370
EM and the first thing I need to do is pick

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.540
the initial centers. Right, so I need to pick the mu's

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.770
that we think these were generated by. And so a common

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.520
thing for people to do is just to take two of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.270
the points from the data set at random. So I took

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.260
two points at random and I'll mark them with an x.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.155
And now what I'm going to do is run an iteration of

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:04.370
EM. And what that means is, I'm going to first do

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.090
expectation, which is going to assign every one of these points to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.450
one of these two clusters. And I'll color them as to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.215
which cluster they belong to. And then I will move the centers,

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:18.815
re-estimate the means based on that soft assignment. Makes sense.

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:22.170
&gt;&gt; Alright, now so what you can see is something kind

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.970
of interesting happened. Because these centers started off in the same

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.760
cluster together, many of them were assigned to one cluster, which

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.800
was the one that was a little bit more above. And

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.850
then very few of them ended up getting assigned to the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.650
lower cluster because very few points were essentially closer to that

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.500
one than the other one. When I colored the lower ones

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.450
red and the upper ones blue. And there's this sort of band

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.220
of 1s in the middle that had intermediate probabilities,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.620
they weren't really deeply one cluster or the other.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.923
&gt;&gt; They were near 0.5?

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:52.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, specifically between, including 0.4 to including 0.6.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.450
&gt;&gt; Okay that make sense.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.070
&gt;&gt; Alright, and so those are the green ones. And

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.806
then based on the cluster assignments, we estimated the means. So

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.050
this xis now at the, you know, the mean of

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.460
the red points. And the green points, because these they're actually

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.790
shared and this acts as kind of the rest. And you can

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.050
see, it doesn't really capture yet what the true clustering is because a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.910
huge number of the lower right cluster points are blue. They're kind of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.940
grouped in with the upper left cluster. But we can run another iteration

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.540
of the app. And now things have shifted, right? So now it

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.580
looks like this lower right cluster has claimed a good amount of the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.040
points in the lower right and the blue ones are the blue ones.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.820
There's just a few little green scattered between them at the boundary and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.180
you always expect some of that to happen. Now, the centers have

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.200
moved and now they are starting to take on their clusters, but we

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.870
just run this a couple more iterations until we see the x is

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.120
not really moving any where. Alright, seems to have settled down and you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.540
can see it really did pull out the lower right cluster, the upper

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.380
left cluster as a cluster and just a few points at the boundary

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.770
where it said well I can sort of believe that that's part of the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.010
red cluster, I can sort of believe it's also part of the blue

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.570
cluster, I really can't decide. And you know what? That's

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.570
probably right too. I mean they could go either way.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. I can sort of hallucinate this green

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.070
point here as being part of the upper cluster. Just

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.860
kind of on the fringe. But, you know, it works

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.580
just as well as being part of the lower cluster.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.180
&gt;&gt; Actually Michael I'm kind of curious. Can you, use

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.030
your magical computer powers to, you know, click on

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.410
one of those green points and see what the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.340
probability is? I could. Yeah, so this, in particular,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.680
it's 55% in the first cluster and 45% in the other cluster.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.750
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.970
&gt;&gt; So, it really is. It's hovering near that boundary.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.030
&gt;&gt; That makes sense. What about that red point all the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.020
way in to the right? The ones that are all by itself.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.322
&gt;&gt; Excellent choice. So, it is actually. 0.9999996

00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:42.460
in one cluster. And 1 minus

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.820
that in the other cluster. This one

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.570
is pretty certain coming from the second cluster.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.370
&gt;&gt; I see two things that

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.110
came out of this. One is EM is much nicer in

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.960
that it's not forced to make a decision about where those green

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.430
points go. So that's sort of soft clustering does that. And

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.190
that's a good thing. Because we don't have that problem that we

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.010
had before. But one of the consequences of that, and this

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.160
is not a bad thing, but it's a thing, is that even

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.220
points that pretty clearly belong to one cluster or another, given that

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.296
we're staring at them. They do have a really high probability, 0.9999999996,

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:14.980
but they all have some non-zero probability. Of

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.640
ending up, of belonging to the other cluster.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.260
&gt;&gt; And is that, you think that's a good thing or a bad thing?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.350
&gt;&gt; I think it's a good thing. I

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.920
think it makes sense because Gaussians have infinite

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.310
extent and even if a point is very, very far away from the center, it has

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.225
some chance of having been generated from that

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:30.940
Gaussian and so, this just tells us what

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.860
that chance is, it is very, very unlikely.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.819
But it is still as non-zero probability match.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.320
&gt;&gt; In, in some sense, it's acknowledging truth.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.450
Right? Which is that you can't be sure

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.100
which of the two clusters, this came form,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.490
even if I tell you where these clusters are.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.900
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay. I, I agree that.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, this is cool. So, EM is nice. So,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.750
does EM work for anything other than Gaussians? It does, it

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.890
actually can be applied in lots of different settings. Let's

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.930
flip over and talk a little about some properties of EM.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.
