00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's now go for a systematic reproduction process.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
First we need to reproduce the environment in which the bug occurs.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Second we need to reproduce the steps required

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to reproduce the problem.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Both of these can be abstracted to input.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
All your program does is dependent on its input.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Therefore, if you can reproduce the input,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you can also reproduce the execution.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
With that we already solved the problem.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Programs are nothing but mathematical functions.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If they have the same input, they will reproduce the same output, right?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Why is there actually a problem of reproducing?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That's the difference between theory and practice.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In theory, there is no difference.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In practice, there is, at least that's the theory.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Indeed, in practice the concept of what makes input to a program

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is very variable.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We distinguish a number of typical inputs,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
each coming up with its own issues.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We do have static data, user interaction, time of day or general time,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
randomness, that is randomness on purpose.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We have the operating environment.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We have schedules, in particular for parallel programs.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We have physical influences, and we do have debugging tools.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
All of these constitute input to the program,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and each of these brings up its own issues

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
as it comes to reproducing failures.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's start with regular static data.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In a batch-oriented program, these are the inputs that is the files of documents

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
your program processes.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Static data is the easiest to reproduce, because it can be

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
handled as an individual entity outside of your program.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If your program operates on files, all you need to do is to ship the data files.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If it works on a database, then use tables instead.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This includes all data that is under the control of the user.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If it's under your control, you probably already know it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So, you care about the variable stuff.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
For one thing, these are documents under the user's control

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
as well as configuration files, in which user's store their preferences

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
or the settings for they system at hand.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Obviously, if you have all the documents and the configuration files

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that your program operates upon,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
then it's fairly easy to reproduce the exact problem.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
However, there's a small catch with that--just a tiny, tiny catch.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This tiny, tiny catch can become a big issue.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Let me illustrate this with an example.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Here again we have our remove html markup function,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and here comes an input as one could find it in, say, a user's document.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We can run the whole thing with this input

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and very easily reproduce the failure.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In this case, the failing assertion.
