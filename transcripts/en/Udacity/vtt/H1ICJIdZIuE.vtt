00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.520
So, we have a good set of user
feedback in the empty list case.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.150
But it would be nice to have this
also reflected in the settings

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.300
part of the app.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.020
Since the material design specifications
specifically says if the summary for

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.950
the preference can be used
the preference status,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.350
we're going to add some status
here about the location.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.280
We'll show the status of the preference,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.520
followed by the value of
the preference in parentheses.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.660
Just like in the forecast fragment.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.700
We can take advantage of
an OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.010
to update the settings UI as
the sync adapter changes the state.
