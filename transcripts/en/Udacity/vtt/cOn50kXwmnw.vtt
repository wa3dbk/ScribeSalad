00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.270
This little section here,
this little lateral geniculate,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.800
is actually part of the thalamus.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.980
If you were to take that thalamus and
take a slice of it,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.630
which is what they're showing here.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.290
And then you stained for cell bodies
and, and the neuroanatomists, they

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.150
really have all sorts of clever ways of
applying different kinds of chemicals

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.200
that light up in different colors or
intensities the different types of

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.595
cellular structures that are there, so
you can actually see what's going on.

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:25.360
If you took this slice,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.430
you would see that the lateral
geniculate has got these layers, right?

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.080
You can see this layer 1 right here,
right layer 2,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.070
and it's really remarkable that they
have these, fixed layers, right?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.660
because remember,
these things just grow,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.900
it's not like somebody got there with
a soldering iron and built them.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.090
These things grow to have these
computational structures, right?

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.150
So, if you take, you know,
the double EEs or

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.470
computer scientists among you,
you're used to seeing schematic charts

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.500
of high end chips that have all
these layered structures in them.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.430
You know, you've got your trans,
your, your transistor arrays here and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.970
different memory things there.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.710
These things just grow like this,
pretty cool.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.450
And the layers are different.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.700
In fact, you can actually tell
a little bit that layers 1 and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.750
2 seem to be a little bit different
from layers 3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.116
And in fact they are.

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:16.550
Layers 1 or 2 are called
the magnacellular layers and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.760
these are referred to as
the parvocellular layers.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.540
And the, most important difference for
you is that 1 and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.430
2 tend to be the where cells.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.740
And these are referred to
as the what cells, and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.580
that has to do with where
they project going forward.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.310
And we'll talk about that in a minute.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.740
The other thing to know is that both
eyes project to the left side for

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.420
whatever's looking at the right
half side of the visual field.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.280
And both eyes, project to the right
side from what's looking at

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.000
the left hand side of the visual field.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.570
Well, you can see that explicitly
in the lateral geniculate.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.859
Layers 1, 4, and
6 come from the same side eye,

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.830
and layers 2, 3, and 5,
I get that right yet, yep.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.960
Come from the other side of the eye.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.110
So we haven't combined the two eyes yet.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.660
Right?
We still have two separate channels.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.430
Why do we have to combine the two eyes?

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.740
Well, how about things like stereo?

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.880
Well, that's going to go
on up in the cortex, right?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.200
You have to be able to get
both of the images together.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.950
But at the, at the LGN level, lateral
geniculate, they are still separate.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.460
The what, goes, the where goes
up to the superior colliculus,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.580
which you can see on this
kind of creepy picture here.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.130
so here it is, kind of creepy
right you got your eyeball.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.940
Anyway what you're seeing here is this,
coming in at the chiasm,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.070
through the lateral geniculate,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.820
and then projecting up to
the superior colliculus.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.050
And the thing that matters as i said,
i think earlier,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.080
the superior colliculus is
involved in eye movements.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.490
So one of the things that has to happen
very quickly, is if something moves over

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.960
here, I have to be able to get my
eyes over there very, very fast.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.520
All right?
So

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.420
you have very good sensitivity to motion
in your retina, in the periphery.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.570
And then you've got a circuitry that's
involved in rapidly going, you know,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.210
it doesn't go very, it doesn't make
many neural stops along the way, right.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.210
We go from your retina which is doing
some chemical stuff right away.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.150
One electrical stop into
the lateral geniculate and

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.280
directly to the superior colliculus.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.070
Now, as I said earlier,
this is an overly simplified story.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.110
I encourage you to take
a course on sensation,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.540
perception and neuroanatomy if
you are interested in this.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.080
But it, the story is pretty close.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.890
So anyway, so those layers 1 and 2 go
directly to the superior colliculus.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.860
But where is the really
cool stuff happening?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.570
Well the really cool stuff happening is
when you leave the lateral geniculate

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.890
and you get up to the cortex.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.340
So here is a another picture of your
brain just to remind you of where

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.420
pieces are.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.650
Again, your nose is over here.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.165
Here's your cerebellum back here,
involved in like balance and

00:03:50.165 --> 00:03:51.395
motor controls.

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:55.545
And here are a bunch of the different
corti, cortex, cortical regions.

00:03:55.545 --> 00:03:56.905
All right?
There's the sulcus,

00:03:56.905 --> 00:04:01.215
which is this sort of gap here,
right behind it, this is somatosensory,

00:04:01.215 --> 00:04:05.135
this is where you feel,
your touch senses are.

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:07.005
Right in front of it,
by the way, not drawn in here,

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:10.315
is a bunch of stuff having to do with
motor control, controlling your muscles.

00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:12.540
Auditory cortex in here.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.850
And then this massive piece of stuff and
the, it doesn't looks quite so

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.790
massive in here, but
it actually folds inside your brain.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.810
We're going to have to unfold
your brain in a minute.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.260
That's all visual cortex and that's all
the processing of visual information
