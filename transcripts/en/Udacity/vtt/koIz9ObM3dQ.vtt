00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For the protocol, we have a value x, which is just 1 bit,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I've been writing the message as a result of encrypting x with some key.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But if we're using a block cipher, well, that assumes that the input is 128 bits.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The key is also 128 bits, and AES does operate with different size keys,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but the minimum key size is 128 bits.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The ciphertext out is 128 bits.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So in this case, we only have 1 bit.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So the question is, what should we do about this?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll give you 3 choices.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We could use the Cipher Feedback Mode and set s to 1,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that allows us to encrypt 1 bit at a time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We could use the ECB mode.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's just using AES passing in the input, and we could pad this input x

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
by adding 127 random bits to the end of it,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
or we could use ECB mode, padding the input with 127 0 bits added after x.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
For the protocol that I've described, which one of these would be the best choice?
