00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, if you took CS101, you had to find HTML tags within a document,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and you did that mostly using the string.find method,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which works okay, but it's fragile and doesn't quite get everything quite right.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The code you wrote was not completely robust to having spaces and lines feeds

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and other things anywhere in the text, so we'd like to do something that's a little bit more robust.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Your problem is to find these HTML tags,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and in particular what I'm looking for are start tags.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Things like we'd begin, and then a would be a tag, and table would be another one and so on.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm not looking for the end tags, so don't worry about those. Just the start tags.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Then something like a and then a set of attribute value pairs.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then a closing angle bracket.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We're looking to find all the instances that look like that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This whole thing--angle bracket, tag, optional set of parameters--parameter equal string.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
These will have to be a string, and they have to be enclosed in double quotes.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can rely on that, and there won't be any double quotes within the string.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That simplifies it a little bit. Then the closing bracket.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But there can be spaces anywhere and so on.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I want you to write a function--call it "findtags"--which you pass it a text,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and then it returns a list of strings that look like that that come out of the text.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You could use whatever tools you found.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You can use the regular expression module "re."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You can use the regular expression parsers that we built.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You can use the context-free parser that we built.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Whatever you think is appropriate.
