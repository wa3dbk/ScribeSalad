00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.980
We just said that the amount of cleaner fluid that Grant needs is greater than

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.930
50 liters. So if we decide to call the amount of cleaner fluid x, then we'll

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.765
have x is greater than 50. How would you represent this inequality on this

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:16.074
number line? Notice that the 50 hash mark is right here, and I've put a question

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:20.429
mark on that to indicate that you need to pick which of these symbols belongs at

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.301
the 50 mark. Then also please tell me, which side of the number line we should

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:25.928
shade in.
