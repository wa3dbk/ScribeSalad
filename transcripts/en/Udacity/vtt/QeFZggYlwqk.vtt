00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.842
Consider a different question,
such as what is the optimal treatment

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:11.170
strategy among already known and
available options, or

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.500
if a particular chronic care model
was changed in a specific way,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.920
what would the outcomes be on
clinical quality and cost.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.320
As opposed to the classic research
question of which drug works best,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.480
determining optimal treatment would
require many alternative experiments.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.080
That is, trying every possible Treatment
Strategy on groups of similar patients.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.110
To answer the second question,
an experiment could be conducted by

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.720
changing the clinical process
in half of the clinic and

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.440
comparing it to the other half
that is operated as before.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.180
However, this would be costly and
complex to do.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.720
These are the types of questions
best answered through modeling and

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.060
simulation using digital health data.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.860
There are a number of techniques for
doing this.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.290
Again, this is not an analytics course,
so we'll describe them, but

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.481
not go into the details
of how they're done.
