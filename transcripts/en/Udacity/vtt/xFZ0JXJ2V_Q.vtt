00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to Office Hours. The first thing I'm going to talk about is homework 3.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There was a lot of confusion on how to do the permalink part, which is mostly my fault.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I will explain what I intended for you to do using this handy-dandy whiteboard.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Okay, the first thing you need to do when you store an object,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you're going to make a post, and it's going to look something like this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You're going to be making this post object, and it has a title and some contents.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I think that was it, but that's not the important part. Most of you figured this out.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
When you put the post in the database in Google App Engine,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you use the put() command to do so.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That actually stores the post in the database.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Once you've stored it in the database, that's when Google App Engine assigns that post an ID.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You can also include an ID in this constructor here when you build it,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but generally it's best just to let the database do it itself, because otherwise you have

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to keep track of which IDs you've used, which ones you haven't used--that sort of thing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We'll let Google set the ID.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We'll put it in the database, and then what we need to do is redirect the user

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to the permalink page for that post, and by permalink, I just mean link to that post.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We need to get this post ID. The way we do that is just say p.key().

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Key() is Google App Engine's full representation of this object,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and this is whole long string.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You can turn this into an integer by calling ID on it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is the integer representation of that post,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we'll convert it into a str--pardon my indentation here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We'll assign this to a variable.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What we'll do then is we'll redirect the user to a URL with this variable in it.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It'll look something like this.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Then we're going to use our string substitutions to include a little string here.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This should redirect the user to /blog/ the ID of this post.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
That's the first part of the problem.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The key thing here that you need to know is how to get the idea of a post you just submitted.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, let me erase this and then the second part of this problem is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
how do you actually look up that blog post.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Now, you've got your URL mappers.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
All the URL mappers that we've done in the class are basically static URLs.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They have the format of something like--remember these are tuples at the bottom of that file.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It might look like '/blog/' and this maps to a handler that just draws a blog.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
In my code, I think it's just called main page, which is the Google default for that first one.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now, we want to do is we want to make a special one for linking to permalinks.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
These strings here that represent the URL are not just strings.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They're actually regular expressions.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We had some regular expressions in Unit 2 when we were validating usernames

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and passwords and that sort of thing.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Well, what we want to have here is a regular expression

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to capture a URL with an integer after it.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
That looks something like this.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This is all just normal string.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
In a regular expression you can just have anything that's just kind of regular text

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
just matches that text exactly.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now, after here we use parentheses to basically say whatever goes in here

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
will be passed as a parameter to our handler function.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We can do something like this: [0-9]+.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
What this means is the square brackets say match any character between these square brackets.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You can use ranges like this.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
This basically says find any number 0 through 9, and the plus means find one or more of them.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This will basically match any URL that starts with /blog/ and then any number,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and we'll map that to some handler for our permalink page,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
which I think in my code I may have called "post handler,"

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
but you can call that whatever you want.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
That's step 2. It's basically do this URL handler. May I have the eraser, please?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Then we'll talk about step 3, which is fairly straightforward. There we go.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You have your handler, so we'll have something that looks like this,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and this inherits from that webapp2 handler or the global handler, whichever you're using.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Then here you have a function that looks something like this: definite get--

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
this handles get requests.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Normally, this just takes one parameter called "self."

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
In this case, we had parentheses in the URL mapper, which means it's going

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to match whatever is in those parentheses and pass it as a parameter to here.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
In this case it's going to be our post ID.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
One quick thing to note. I never call variables ID in Python because ID is actually a function.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It's a reserved function, and it's really easy to create really subtle bugs

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
if you start using the word ID.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
All my variables that refer to IDs always are something_id.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Now what we want to is get our post out of the database.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
In App Engine this just looks something like this: p = Post--

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
this is our class that we defined that's the actual data model.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
You can say get<u>by</u>id(post_id).

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That'll do a database query to look up the post with ID out of the database.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Then all you need to do is if p, and then you can render it however you planned on doing that.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
If p doesn't exist you can just return a 404.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
That's how you do the permalink portion of the homework.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I hope you guys manage to get all this working. I'm sorry.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I probably should have covered get<u>by</u>id in the lecture,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but that's the fun of teaching for the first time.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Good luck everybody and thanks for sticking with us so far.
