00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.130
Now that we have a better understanding of our variables, and

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.530
the overall demand for diamonds, let's replot the data. This time

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.070
we'll put price on a log10 scale, and here's what it

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.860
looks like. This plot looks better than before. On the log

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.830
scale, the prices look less dispersed at the high end of

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.110
Carat size and price, but actually we can do better. Let's

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.350
try using the cube root of Carat in light of our

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.770
speculation about flaws being exponentially more

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.860
likely in diamonds with more volume.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.640
Remember, volume is on a cubic scale. First, we need

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.730
a function to transform the Carat variable. If you'd like to

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.290
learn more about writing your own functions in R, check out

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.830
the links in the instructor notes. This may seem like a

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.840
lot of code, but really, there's only one new piece here.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.240
It's this cube root trans-function. It's a function that takes the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.100
cube root of any input variable, and it also has an

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.950
inverse function to undo that operation, which we need to display

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310
the plot correctly. Then when we get to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.380
our actual ggplot command. What we'll do is we'll

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.200
use the scale_x_continuous argument to transform the x

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.810
axis with this cube root transformation function. Keep in

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.634
mind we're also transforming the y axis with

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:11.350
this log10 transformation that we discussed previously. And, let's

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.080
see what this plot looks like. Taking a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.970
look at the plot, we can actually see that

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.150
with these transformations that we used to get

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.930
our data on this nice scale. Things look almost

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.310
linear. We can now move forward and see

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.930
about modelling our data using just a linear model.
