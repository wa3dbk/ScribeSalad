00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.140
So I'm going to start with
something we actually discussed

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.840
at the very beginning of our class,
which is the idea of threat modeling and

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.230
developing a security mindset.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.470
Which requires us to think like
the people who are going to attack us or

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.640
their adversary.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.543
Now I know you've done some real
interesting work in this area.

00:00:19.543 --> 00:00:20.200
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.420
how does one think like the adversary?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.200
Well first off I'd say it's almost
a guarantee to make you less popular

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.120
if you think like that, but you have to.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.300
A lot involves getting into the head
of someone you think that would

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.410
have some purpose that's
counter to yours.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.010
So if you're designing a system
you have to say well who would be

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.000
incentivized for a variety of
reasons to subvert that system?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.550
And then try and anticipate who they are
and how resourced they are, what type of

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.000
capabilities they have, and then what
they could then, in turn, do to you.
