00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.125
Now you learned before that in a normal distribution, about 68% are within one

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:12.088
standard deviation of the mean and 95% are within two standard deviations of the

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:17.350
mean. But this is for regular, normally distributed population. Here we're

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.890
talking about the sampling distribution. So each score in the data set is a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.100
mean, and the standard deviation is the population standard deviation divided by

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.242
the square root of the sample size N. So 95% of sample means will fall within

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:41.313
two times the standard error of the population mean.
