00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.610
While I was working as a Fire Chief,
working hard around

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.800
cardiac arrest survival, training
people in CPR in our community and

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.370
putting AEDs in the community,
but I was out to lunch one day.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.300
I heard a siren in the distance.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.060
It grew louder and ended up pulling
right in front of a deli where I was

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.590
eating, that's when I learned that
somebody right next door had suffered

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.660
a cardiac arrest, and I wasn't aware
of that until that ambulance got there.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.360
That event made me realize that
even though somebody's trained,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.240
they're not always in the exact right
place and the exact right time, and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.250
maybe we can bring technology in, where
firefighters are alerted with radios,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.390
maybe we could use people's cell phones,
who are trained in CPR,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.180
even our off duty professionals,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.850
make them aware of the events that
they were close too but couldn't see.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.020
We're crowdsourcing good Samaritans,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.870
that's really the purpose
of the Pulse Point app.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.750
The solution that we have,
only can exist with a mobile app,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.810
where you have push notifications,
you have location based services,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.120
you have people carrying phones who
have the sophistication to do this.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.300
We have an entirely
volunteer development team.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.570
So Android being so widely adopted,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.790
it's a platform when we put our
development time into that,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.280
we know it's going to get into
the hands of a lot of users.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.890
As a fire chief I didn't have app
developers, no programmers on my staff.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.830
But we understood the problem very well.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.810
So we ended up turning to a university,
NKU, Northern Kentucky University,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.340
who had an app development school.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.540
And we brought out
a number of interns and

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.550
sucked them up here in the Bay area,
and prototyped using interns.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.640
Once we've proven the concept,
that's when we turned to deductial and

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.060
workday and they sort of helped
take the concept and make it real.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.520
When you first load the application,
it shows you all the emergencies that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.370
are happening around you,
not just cardiac arrests.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.550
If you want to be notified
of cardiac arrests,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.150
you just go into the setting screen and
you select the CPR notification.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.130
Once you've done that, if a cardiac
arrest occurs within walking distance of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.930
you, you'll be notified.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.580
And you'll receive a map, and
it'll show you where you are,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.350
where the patient's located, and
any nearby public access defibrillators.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.160
The app also provides CPR instructions.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.050
So reminders, and also a metronome

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.430
that can help you set the proper
cadence of your chest compressions.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.800
You can't solve this
upfront on a white board.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.120
It's a constant iteration,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.370
learning from your users,
getting experience in the field.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.670
And you have to be in the game.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.320
You have to actually be solving
the problem to be able to learn enough

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.510
to make a difference.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.700
We had somebody playing soccer,
at a local school,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.740
collapse with cardiac arrest,
911 is called, and we have

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.150
an EMT who's home with his family that
lives across the street from the school.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.280
Gets notified, just runs across the
street to do CPR, an event he would not

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.780
have been aware of but very close by,
and saved the gentleman's life.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.790
So it's actually seeing the app save
lives, those are where you say,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.390
we really made a difference
in these people's lives.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.480
And we have so much potential to
do it again, and again, and again.
