Now, just as on a CPU, there are different levels of optimization for the GPU.

00:00:03.572 --> 00:00:06.377
There's picking good algorithms in the first place.

00:00:06.377 --> 00:00:10.081
There's some basic principles for writing efficient code.

00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.380
There's architecture-specific detailed optimizations,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.484
and there's sort of bit twiddling micro-optimization at the instructions level.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:24.060
So, let's use a quiz to explore a few CPU examples. There's the use of vector registers such as SSE and AVX.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.130
There's the use of something like mergesort which runs an order n log n time versus insertion sort

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.971
which runs an order n squared time. Next is writing cache-aware code,

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.539
meaning write code that is likely to make efficient use of the cache.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:44.346
So an example would be it's generally faster to traverse across the rows of a large 2D array than down the columns,

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:49.085
assuming that array is laid out in row order. You'll get better cache performance in that case.

00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:52.323
Or you can do explicit cache blocking, for example,

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.356
for the L1 cache and a CPU core.

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:58.827
Or finally, you could approximate the inverse square root of a floating point number

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:04.534
by shifting it right one bit and subtracting it from the integer 0x5f3759df.
