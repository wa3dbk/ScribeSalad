00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now we finished up with random testing, we're going to talk about some more

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
advanced testing issues, such as what to do when a false tester overloads you with bugs.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And it sounds kind of silly but it can really happen in practice.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're also going to talk about how to take a large test case that makes software fail

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and turn it into a very small test case.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Finally, we're going to talk about how to report bugs in such a way

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the developers are more likely to pay attention to them.
