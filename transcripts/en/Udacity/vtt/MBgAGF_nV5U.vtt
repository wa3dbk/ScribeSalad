00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:02.903
So today, you’re in for a treat. You’re going

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:04.851
to learn a theorem and I won't prove anything

00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:07.432
to you, you learn it by doing but this theorem

00:00:07.432 --> 00:00:10.882
is really important for all of statistics. So let’s dive in.

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:14.130
And what this theorem really is about many coin

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.082
flips. Almost generally it’s about the

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.534
distribution of the sum of many things.

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:23.000
So let’s study many things.
