00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.238
We know the equivalent fraction for 1 6th is 4 24ths and the equivalent fraction

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.489
for 3 8ths is 9 24ths. I'm taking away 4 24ths and 9 24ths, so altogether, I'm

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:16.665
taking away 13 24ths. I can see that visually, too. I have one, two, three,

00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:22.310
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13 24ths. Those are the pieces

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:29.531
I'm trying to subtract from my whole cake. So, 24 24ths minus 13 24ths leaves me

00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:36.839
with 11 24ths. That means this region must represent 11 24ths of my cake, that's

00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:41.310
the fraction that's not frosted. Let's see if this makes sense visually too.

00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:45.856
I've split my cake into 24ths, and if I count up the chocolate pieces that are

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:50.004
not frosted, I can see that I have 11 of those. So I have 11 24ths of my cake

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:50.694
not frosted.
