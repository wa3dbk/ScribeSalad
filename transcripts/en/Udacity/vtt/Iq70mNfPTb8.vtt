00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
Now in general and you might have come across one or more of these examples,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.580
using randomness is of course quite important in Computer Science.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.090
You might've come across randomness, for example, in crytography

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.600
where randomness is in a way the only way to fully securely encode a message.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.930
You might've encountered randomness in something called symmetry breaking.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's say you walk down a hallway and somebody comes in your direction,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.770
and you're trying to get out of the way of that person but the moment that you get out of the way,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.200
that person also tries to get out of the way in the same direction,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.830
and so if you did not have random decisions, then you would almost certainly crash into each other.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.610
And finally randomness is often used in simulations,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.830
so when you do physics simulation or financial scenarios,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.240
then of course, also randomness is something very, very useful.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.540
Now, the difficulty with using randomness to solve NP complete problems is this,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.330
in all of these examples here, being as random as possible is something rather desirable.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.630
So in cryptography, you want perfect randomness because that gives you the most security.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.440
Symmetry breaking works best if you have as much randomness as possible,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.880
so that these two entities, say, will make completely independent decisions of each other.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.370
And in simulation of course too, because the point of using randomness

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.410
in simulation is to simulate random processes, so you want to model that as good as possible.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.940
Now for NP complete problems, this doesn't work because for NP complete problems,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.800
we don't want perfect randomness.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.690
What we are looking for is a needle in a haystack and finding a needle in a haystack

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.930
simply by poking it from a few random directions won't really help.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.180
And that is why we need to direct our randomness.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.580
Let's say, you use randomness in a very naive way to solve clique

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.690
and just assign all of the vertices, random values of 0 and 1.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.050
Now let's say you're doing this for a graph with n vertices.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.380
Well, actually I think you can answer this question if I give you four choices from which to choose.

00:01:53.380 --> 99:59:59.000
So is it 1/n²? Is it (1/2)^n? Is it 1/2  n? or is it 2^n/n²?
