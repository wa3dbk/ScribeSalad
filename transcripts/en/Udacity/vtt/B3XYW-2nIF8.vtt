00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.985
Well, we already know that our behavior is a result of what goes on in our

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:10.060
environment and in our brains. And our brains are essentially created by our

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.270
DNA. So, we know that our genes have some kind of connection with behavior, so

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.450
we know that the last one's not right. We also can guess that behaviors are

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.140
very complex. So, one gene controlling one behavior is probably not what's

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.310
going on. And even just a few genes regulating all behaviors is probably not

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.300
likely either. As you might have guessed, many genes are behind any given

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.528
particular behavior. And as we go through this course, you'll see exactly how

00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:44.769
complex some of these behaviors can be.
