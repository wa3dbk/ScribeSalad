One of the most used implicit intents
in Android is the share intent.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.860
(laughs) It's awesome.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
It's a great way to waste time
for both you and your friends.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.216
(cell phone rings)

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.610
- (chuckles) 
- (director) Dan!

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.710
You can leverage your favorite apps 
to share photos, texts,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.840
videos and general links. 
And the best part is you don't have

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.190
to even know what the user's 
favorite apps are.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.740
Just tell Android what data you want 
to share and it shows your users

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.940
a list of apps that will share it,
apps that may not have existed

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.000
when you app was written. 
To make it even easier to share,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.750
Android 4.0 added 
the share action provider

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.820
and we have it for previous releases 
of Android as part of a support library.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.700
It operates using the action send intent.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.580
If we use Raytoe's 
glorious envelope metaphor,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.990
it would be addressed to anyone 
who could perform action send.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.290
The data descend would be 
included with it as extras,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.260
either as text, 
or URI to the binary data.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.720
And the MIME type would indicate 
what the URI points to.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.910
Here's what the share action provider 
will bring to our app:

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.630
the glorious wire frame. 
There will be an additional icon

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.030
in the action bar, which will
drop down a menu

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.870
when clicked to reveal 
potential share actions.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.930
Another icon will be added 
to the right of this one

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.310
that contains the last 
application shared to.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.550
Add a ShareActionProvider 
to the fragment within DetailActivity.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.540
It will share weather 
in the following format.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.834
Yes, it's just the string we passed 
into the view, plus #SunshineApp.
