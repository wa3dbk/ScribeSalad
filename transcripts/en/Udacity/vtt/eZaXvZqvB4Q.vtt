00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.860
I rearranged things on the screen here a
little bit. just so I'd have room to write

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.264
my answer out, but this is all the
information that you had to start the last

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:12.307
quiz with. Remember, from our practice
using substitution before, that if we see

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.091
a variable in one equation, but we know
that that variable is = to some other

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:20.387
expression, then we can substitute in that
alternate expression in the place of the

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.834
original variable. So, in the case of w
and n, for example, we have these two

00:00:24.846 --> 00:00:31.216
numbers that we can now replace them with.
So, we see w here, 402w, and w here, w = 30.

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:35.729
So I can take the 30, and move it into
this slot. And I can do the same thing

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.343
with n and 12. I'm going to rewrite this
side of the equation again, but this time

00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:46.111
with our new numbers plugged in. In place
of w I put 30 and in place of n I put 12.

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:51.970
Now we need to recall our understanding of
order of operations. So PEMDAS. The thing

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.624
we need to decide here is whether we
multiply or we add first. Since we have we

00:00:56.624 --> 00:00:59.642
have two terms that are multiplied and
another two terms that are multiplied but

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:03.562
then also an addition sign. In our past
practice with simplifying expressions we

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:07.075
always simplified within each term, or
multiplied everything out, before we

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:11.176
combined like terms or added, and that's
completely in line with PEMDAS. Remember,

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:14.924
this is an acronym to help you remember
the order in which you do different

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:19.000
mathematical operations within a given
expression. So the M here, which stands for

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:23.723
multiplication, comes before the A, which
stands for addition. So we're going to do

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:32.106
our multiplication first. 402 times 30 =
12,060, and 480 times 12 = 5,760. Last but not

00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:38.668
least, we add these two numbers together.
This gives us a final answer of 17,820.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:43.017
Much to the delight of Grant and his
venture capital funders. They're going to

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:48.326
bring in $17,820 with just the
orders that have been placed so far in the

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:53.170
first few weeks. That is really
incredible. Grant has proven that he has a

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.461
product, or actually two products, that are
popular and people think are really going

00:01:57.461 --> 00:02:01.951
to be useful. He is convinced he's out to
change the world, or at least the way that

00:02:01.963 --> 00:02:06.120
glasses wearers see the world.
Congratulations on great work, we covered

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:09.277
a ton of material, and I am sure that you
did great.
