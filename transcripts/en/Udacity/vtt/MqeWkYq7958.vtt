00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.719
Now, we just measured
the error of this linear model

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.810
against our original training data.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.410
We know, though, from say,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.710
k and n, that we can build models that
can fit this training data exactly.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.210
So we can have arbitrarily small
error against our training set.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.850
The more important measure is,
what is our error out of sample?

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.240
So, what out of sample means is
we train on our training set, but

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.030
we test on a separate
testing set of data.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.720
And, that's going to be
different than our training set.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.650
So, to measure out of sample error, we
look at the error from our testing set,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.030
not our training set.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.020
So we look at each one of these test
points and measure the error for

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.690
each one of those.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.700
So we look at these blue points
instead of the green points,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.340
plug them into this equation
just like before, and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.324
that's our out of sample
root mean squared error.
