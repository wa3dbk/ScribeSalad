00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.381
For the first inequality, we had x was less than or equal to 8. And all of these

00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:08.952
numbers on this number line represent the solution set for that inequality. For

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:13.409
the second inequality, we had x greater than or equal to 5. All of these numbers

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:18.005
satisfy this condition. But we have a compound inequality, we want numbers that

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:22.919
satisfy the first inequality and the second inequality. So, what do you think?

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:28.072
Which number line represents solutions for both inequalities? Choose the best

00:00:28.084 --> 00:00:33.112
answer. As a hint, you can try plugging in values for different regions and see

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:34.373
if they work in both.
