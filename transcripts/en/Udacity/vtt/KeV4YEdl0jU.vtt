00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.150
Encryption schemes and attacks on
encryption schemes have been around for

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.460
thousands of years.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.660
The main attack approaches
are brute force and cryptanalysis.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.160
One other use of cryptography
includes some combination of hash,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.530
secret key cryptography, and
public key cryptography.
