00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:03.628
Do you ever feel like leaving you
problems behind, strapping on your arm

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:06.692
cannon and going on an adventure
to jump around on top of stuff and

00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:08.021
blast away at evil robots?

00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:09.195
I know, right?

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:10.054
Me too.

00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:13.709
Welcome to our second course on
2D game development with Lib GDX.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.029
In the first course, we made
a simple game of dodging icicles.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.240
In this course, we'll learn how to
make a much more complex platformer

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.426
game featuring our hero, Giga Gal.

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:27.345
In the first three levels, you'll let
Giga Gal walk around, including this

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:31.158
cool walk animation, and you'll let
her jump around on top of platforms.

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:34.441
Giga Gal will jump around on
the top of platforms, dodging and

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.613
fighting enemies with bullets
fired out of her arm cannon.

00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:39.191
Sounds pretty cool, huh?

00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:42.558
So what do we need to do
to bring Giga Gal to life?

00:00:42.558 --> 00:00:44.834
This course has eight levels to beat.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.778
In this level,
you'll learn how to draw the images and

00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:50.151
animations that make
up Giga Gal's world.

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:54.631
In the next levels, we'll add the logic
for Giga Gal herself, the platforms, and

00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:57.650
the camera that follows
Giga Gal around the game world.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.960
In the second half of the course,
we will add the evil robot enemies, and

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.372
let Giga Gal fight back with her cannon.

00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:08.254
Finally, we will learn to load
level data, and add a HUD and

00:01:08.254 --> 00:01:09.816
on-screen controls.

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:13.521
By the way, this course relies heavily
on the content from our first course on

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:16.600
2D game development with Lib GDX,
so if you haven't already,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.640
you'll definitely want to take
that course before moving on.
