00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.765
The solution we just saw has some problems, it had wires the ID generation into

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:06.955
the person class, so if somebody is writing code and they want to use the

00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:12.859
person's class in their code, but they want ID's to be generated differently.

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.104
Maybe they want ID's to start at a 1000 or may be they only want prime ID's

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:19.624
they can't change the way the ID's are being assigned so what would be a better

00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:26.597
way to assign ID's to our persons? We would create a new interface, IdProvider

00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:30.890
which would have a method next to Id. You can think of an interface sort of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.035
like a class for now. We'll talk about these more in lesson nine. But now that

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:39.995
we have this when we create a person, we can take in an ID provider, and use it

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:46.680
to set the ID. Then we don't need the static variable anymore. This is what

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.456
objects are all about, if you want different policies, you create different

00:00:50.456 --> 00:00:54.000
objects. There's no reason to be tied to a static variable in order to count

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.433
the ID's. In production code you should never use static variables unless you

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:03.032
declare them final and capitalize them and use them as constants, static

00:01:03.032 --> 00:01:06.926
variable seem convenient, but when you write real code they cause bugs because

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:12.880
they don't get cleaned up when you are done the way objects do
