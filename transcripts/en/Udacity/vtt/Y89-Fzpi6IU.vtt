00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is most definitely not.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This protocol depends on the integrity of the messages received.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
One easy way to see how it can fail is if an active attacker can change the value

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of ya to 1 and change the value of yb to 1,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
then Alice and Bob will still agree on a key but that key would be 1 raised to their secret power,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is still 1.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It would be the key value 1, which would be known to the eaves dropper

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and make all messages encrypted using that key vulnerable.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The attacker could also intercept that protocol here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and separately execute the protocol with each party.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This would make Alice think that she has a secure key with Bob,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but it's actually a secure key shared with an attacker in the middle.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It would make Bob that that he has a secure key with Alice,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but it's actually a key shared with an attacker in the middle.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That means the attacker in the middle could take a message that Alice encrypts

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
with this key that's actually shared with the attacker in the middle,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
can decrypt that message, can then re-encrypt that message

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
using the key that the attacker shared with Bob and send the result to Bob.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Bob will decrypt it, thinking it's a good message from Alice.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This is a very dangerous attack.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Diffie-Hellman can only be used in places where either the integrity of the channel is guaranteed

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
or there is a way for Bob to find out Alice's ya value and know that it's really Alice.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It could also be useful in the case where there's some trusted directory that has the y values.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Bob could look up Alice's ya value, know the q and the g values,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and then Bob would know that he's communicating with Alice if he trusts this directory.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
One way to provide that is using a certificate authority,

00:01:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which we'll talk about in unit 5.
