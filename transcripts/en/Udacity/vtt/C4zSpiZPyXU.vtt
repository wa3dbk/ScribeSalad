00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.510
All right so now you understand how
a sample app with the list view and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.340
custom array adapter work.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.510
So that's a great starting point for

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.790
understanding how we can make
the corresponding changes in our app.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.580
Now that Android Flavor App had two text
views and one image view per list item.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.320
In the case of our Miwok App,
we'll want to have two text views.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.080
And this is why we'll need to
create a custom array adapter,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.740
because the default one only
works with a single text view.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.878
So let's start with
step one of the quiz.

00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:30.700
First we asked you to create a list of
word objects and here's the code for

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.530
the ArrayList of word objects.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.880
Notice that each word object created has
an English and Miwok translation pair.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.740
So make sure the order of the inputs
is English word first and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.000
then Miwok word, and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.750
remember that's because that's how we
set it up in the word constructor here.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.680
Now back in the NumbersActivity,
we asked you to modify

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.290
the way that the adapter was created and
set it on the list view.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.170
So we provided some code for you that
you could add to the NumbersActivity

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.940
to make sure that the word
adapter was built correctly.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.530
So we had you remove the old
ArrayAdapter code and

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.310
then the onCreate method
would look like this.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.019
So here we're creating a new
WordAdapter object and

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.340
storing it in a variable called adapter.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.650
We're calling the constructor and
passing in a context.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.329
So that's what this refers,
it refers to the NumbersActivity and

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.480
then passing in the array
list of word objects.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.570
There we're finding a list view in
the layout with ID called lists.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.850
And then setting the adapter on it.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.990
Now for the third step, we asked you
to create a new word adapter class.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.720
And we showed you the instructions for
how to do this in the earlier video.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.620
For the fourth step,
we modified the class declaration so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.940
that the word adapter extends or
inherits from the array adapter class.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.391
So by specifying the word class
as a generic parameter here,

00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:46.040
we expect the ArrayAdapter's data
source be the list of word objects.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.730
Now in the fifth step, we asked
you to override the getView method

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.540
to provide your own
implementation of the method.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.360
So this code here was
generated by Android Studio.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.570
You could have either used the keyboard
shortcut, Control +O or gone up here.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.210
To Code, Override Method and
selected getView Method.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.930
So for step six, we asked you to
complete this method with your own

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.180
implementation and pointed you to
the AndroidFlavor app as an example.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.110
So let me open up the AndroidFlavor app.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.850
Here's the code for

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.890
the AndroidFlavor adapter in
the customer array adaptor example.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.410
So down here is its getView method,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.045
since this logic is very similar to the
getView method we need in our Miwok app.

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:27.664
Let's just copy and
paste this section over into our code.

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:34.172
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:37.210
So I just pasted that code
into the WordAdapter class.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.980
First we're making sure that we
have a list item view even if it

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.420
doesn't have the right data.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.030
So we could try to use the recycled
view that came in as an input parameter.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.350
However it is possible that it could be
null meaning that there is no view to

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.310
reuse.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.720
In this case we will need to inflate one
from the list item layout from scratch.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.040
We can use the LayoutInflator from
Android, and call the inflate method,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.490
passing in the layout resource ID, the
parent view, which is the list view and

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.490
false here, because we don't want to
attach the list item view to the parent

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.100
list view just yet.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.470
The next step is that we'll need to
find the word object at the requested

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.032
position so

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:12.940
we can start to set the appropriate
data onto the views in that layout.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.960
So we'll call the getItem method
which comes from the superclass array

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.840
adapter and it takes in as its
input the desired position.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.600
Now instead of returning an Android
flavor object we'd like this getItem to

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.400
return a word object and this is because
our class declaration says that we

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.370
inherit from array adapter where word is
the return type of the getItem method.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.090
Let's take a look at the documentation
for the get item method.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.280
So here's the documentation for the get
item method from the ArrayAdapter class.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.390
So in this case we can
substitute the word datatype

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.370
anywhere that we see
the generic parameter T.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.070
And let's head back to the code.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.120
Now for these next three sections,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.670
we don't have an image view
in our layout just yet.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.720
So we can delete these lines of
code related to setting an image on

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.270
the ImageView.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.340
Let's navigate over to
the listItem XML layout.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.185
Remember that we have two TextViews
within here, one with a view id called

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:10.000
miwok_text_view and one with a view
id called default_text_view.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.868
And know it might be slightly different
in your code if you chose to name

00:04:12.868 --> 00:04:14.060
them differently.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.720
This means that back in the word adapter
class, the list item view variable

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.740
is currently referencing the root
linear layout for the list item layout.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.110
So if we call the find view by
ID method on the list item view,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.820
then we can find the Miwok text view,
and once we find that

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.364
we can cast the view to a text view,
because it is a text view,

00:04:34.364 --> 00:04:38.570
and then go ahead and
store it in a Miwok text view variable.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.700
After that we can call the set
text method on the text view, and

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.370
then pass in the new text
that needs to be displayed.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.701
So this would be, the Miwok translation
string from the current word object.

00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:53.242
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:55.998
So reading this line of code
can be a little bit complex.

00:04:55.998 --> 00:04:59.425
But let's just start by reading the
expression within the parenthesis first.

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:04.130
So on the current word object we
call the method getMiwokTranslation.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.703
So this returns a string that's
a Miwok word and that becomes input to

00:05:07.703 --> 00:05:11.200
the set text method call on
the Miwok TextView object.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.895
So now the Miwok TextView
should display the Miwok word.

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:17.475
We will repeat the same steps for
the default TextView.

00:05:17.475 --> 00:05:21.015
So the listItemView points to the linear
layout in the list_item layout.

00:05:21.015 --> 00:05:24.935
So we'll call findViewById
to search all its children.

00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:29.079
We find the view with ID default text
view and cast it to a text view and

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:32.817
then we'll store it in a variable
called defaultTextView.

00:05:34.157 --> 00:05:38.657
After that on the currentWord object
we'll call the getDefault translation

00:05:38.657 --> 00:05:42.207
method and this helps us get
the English translation string.

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:45.177
Now this becomes input to
the setText method call

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.137
on the defaultTextView object.

00:05:47.137 --> 00:05:50.720
So now the defaultTextView
should display the English word.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.950
Now with all that done,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.380
we just need to return the list
item view as a return value.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.270
So the list view will take its return
value and add it as a child to itself.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.880
Whew!
That was really challenging, but

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.330
thanks for hanging in there.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.770
So to recap,

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.830
in our getView method we first get
a list item view that we can use.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.510
So either by reusing the one
that was given to us or

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.940
inflating a new one
completely from scratch.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.650
Then we get the word object
at the given position and

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.850
after that we can start finding
the views in the list item layout and

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.480
setting data onto them
from the word object.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.880
And lastly we can return
the updated ListItemView.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.900
So let's try to run the code now.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.170
Hm, it looks like there's
an error in the numbers activity.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.450
It says that there is an error
with creating the word adapter.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.870
So that's because we forgot to create
the constructor in the word adaptor.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.370
Remember, that takes two inputs,
the contacts and list of words.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.490
So let's go ahead and do that now.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.290
Let's take a look at the example
in the FlavorAdapter app.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.040
We described the constructor
earlier in the last video.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.720
So you can refer back
to it if we need it.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.510
So here I am back again looking
at the example Flavor app.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.600
So we described the constructor
early in the last video.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.750
So you can refer back to that if needed.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.190
Now we're going to need something
similar to this for our word adapter.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.847
So I'm going to copy and paste this
constructor over and then tweak it.

00:07:06.847 --> 00:07:09.122
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:12.670
So at the top of the word adapter class
I'm going to paste that constructor we

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.920
copied over.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.050
Now instead of Android Flavor adapter
we need it to be word adapter,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.700
because remember the constructor
name needs to match the class name.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.860
Also inside this list here,
instead of a list of Android Flavors,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.740
we want a list of words.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.810
And lastly inside this constructor, we
can call the superclass Android adaptors

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.070
constructor by passing in the context,
the layout resource ID, and

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.480
then the list of objects.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.800
So we'll need to update
this towards as well.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.760
Remember that we can pass in zero for
layout resource ID here

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.520
because we're inflating the layout
ourselves in the get view method.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.550
Here's what the app looks
like on our device.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.280
So navigating into the numbers activity.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:50.980
Nice.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.980
So the list is showing the Miwok and
English words.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.370
So congratulations.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.070
Really great work.
