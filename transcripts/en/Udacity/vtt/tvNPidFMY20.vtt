00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.080
So here I'm showing you that actual
wagon-wheel algorithm that we just

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.760
talked about,
this systematic resampling.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.610
You start off with no new samples, and
you build your, the c's are going to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.080
represent the outer ring,
the cumulative distribution function.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.890
And, essentially,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.929
each one represents the one before
it plus the extra new weight.

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.213
Right?
So, you start off at the first weight,

00:00:22.213 --> 00:00:24.321
and then c2 is the sum of w1 and w2.

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.330
C3 is the sum of w1, w2 and w3.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.331
That's that outer ring, okay?

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:31.176
You can think of it,
that if it goes from zero to one,

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:34.735
because everything sums to one,
then the c's are sort of how far,

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:37.410
what percentage around
the clock have you gone?

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.250
The next thing you do is you have
to pick, remember I told you, you,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.110
you have to sort of randomly throw
down the wagon-wheel to start with.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.815
Well if the wagon wheel
has eight spokes,

00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:49.553
the first spoke has to go somewhere
between zero and one-eighth.

00:00:49.553 --> 00:00:51.550
That's what this is right here, right?

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.400
N to the minus 1, 1,
remember you could write it as 1 over n.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.795
That's the offset.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:01.165
And then what you do is you go around
the outer ring seeing, wait, did I pass

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:05.565
my offset yet, as soon as I've passed
it, that's the cdf part that I'm in.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.474
So just drawing that on here,
if this my first one, right?

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:12.835
And I, and, and this is where it
starts on the outer ring I say,

00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:13.797
did I pass it yet?

00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:14.802
I say, nope.

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.780
'kay, did I pass it yet?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.045
Yes, I did.
So this first spoke landed in w2.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:24.666
Then I just go to the next spoke, and
I say, did my last marker pass it?

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.240
No, I gotta go to the next one.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.990
Did this pass it?

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.790
Yes, so my next one is from w3.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.840
So that's all I do, is I, I initialize
it and then I just count up for

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.400
however many samples that I need,
I go and

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.310
I grab the next wagon-wheel chunk and
I see where on the cdf that it lands.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.930
And then I just return that set.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.100
It, it looks more
complicated than it is and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.280
it's a way of doing that sampling in,
in linear time.
