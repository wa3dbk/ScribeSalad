00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.940
The fundamental problem with server selection is determining

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.790
which server to direct the client to. One

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.189
could do this based on a number of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.350
criteria, such as the least loaded sever, the one

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.030
with the lowest network latency or simply to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.790
any alive server to help provide fault times.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.950
Content distribution networks typically aim to direct clients

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.210
towards servers that provide the lowest latency. For the

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.000
reasons that we talked about before, since latency plays a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.479
hugely significant role, in the web performance that clients see.
