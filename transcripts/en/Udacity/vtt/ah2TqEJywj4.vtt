00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.910
Alright ,just to make sure that you understand. let's let's

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.350
think through an example. let's imagine, that we've gotta a

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.920
neuron. We got one of these perception units. And the

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.350
input, to it ,is one, zero negative one point five. For

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.880
the three different, inputs in this case. And the corresponding

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.070
weights, are half three fifths and one... And the threshold, let's

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.030
say is zero, meaning that it should fire, if the

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.350
weighted sum is above zero, or equal to zero, and otherwise,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.850
it should not fire. So, what I'd like you to compute, is

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.470
based, on these numbers, what the output y would be in this case
