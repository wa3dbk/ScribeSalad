00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Could you speculate a little bit about how a company like Facebook

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
could use information about things like users clicking on a like button on something

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to suggest possibly people to be friends with?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
[Tina] Right. A simple way is this idea that --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's assume we have Mary, John, and Jill.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And Mary is friends with John and Jill, but John and Jill are not friends with each other.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Every time Mary posts something, both John and Jill like it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, because they keep liking the things that Mary posts,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we think, wow, they should like each other as well and want to be friends.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In fact, another reason that it makes sense to have them be friends

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is that they're both friends with Mary,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and so they share a common friend and they like a lot of the stuff that Mary is posting.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, that would be a good friend suggestion.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The more friends they have in common, the higher this idea

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of, oh, they would want to be friends, because they share a lot of common friends.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is a whole area called tie strength

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
about how strongly am I tied to you or would I be tied to you?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We actually recently had a paper at a web science conference on this.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
When I actually go out of my way and like something,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it means that--and you go out of your way and like it--

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
it means that maybe we should be friends, because we like the same kinds of things.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's also connected to the concept of homophily--

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
this idea of like attracting like.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's been around in history for a very long time.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In fact, it dates all the way back to Plato,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
which says similarity begets friendship.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Or for example in more common day we say "Birds of a feather flock together."

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
In a social network, links tend to connect people who are similar to one another.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So, I'm similar to you and so I would like to be your friend,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and so I have a link to you.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If, for example, you want to find out about whether I'm a good guy or a bad guy,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
you can look at my friends and see if the majority of them are good guys or bad guys.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If the majority of them are good guys, then you would guess, well, Tina must be a good guy,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
because she's friends with a lot of good guys.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And that's where also this idea of egonets comes along.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
An egonet is a term in sociology,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and it refers to the ego.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And then I have my alters, which are my friends.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So, my friends are my alters, and the person you're considering is called the "ego."

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The egonet is the network that connects the ego to the alters

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and that connects the alters together.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You can have egonets that look like a star where you have the ego and the alters,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
but none of the alters know each other.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Or you can have a clique where everybody knows each other in this egonet.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The ego obviously knows all the alters and is friends with all the alters

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and all the alters are friends with each other.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In fact, going back to this idea of recommending links,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the closer--the more cliquey--your egonet is,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the more links there are in your egonet,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the more likely it is that the alters that aren't connected with each other

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
would want to be connected to each other.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Now, we looked at something in the class called the clustering coefficient.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Is it safe to define that as the density of the connections among your alters?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Or, if you want to think about it, the number of triangles that exist, right?, in your egonet.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Selection is the tendency of people to form friendship with others who are like them.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If you wanted to target an outreach for a particular product,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
you're assuming that there is selection going on.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Influence is the fact that we're already friends,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and people may change their behavior to bring them more closely

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
into alignment with their friends.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
That's where, for example, a lot of viral marketing is good for.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If you're trying to push something where the underlying cause is social influence,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
then you would want to go with viral marketing.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So, with selection the individual characteristics drive the formation of friendship links,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and then with influence is the existing links in the networks to people's characteristics.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So, I buy iPhone and really like it. I play with it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
That influences you to go buy an iPhone.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Usually when people talk about influence they also talk about contagion.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It's basically the same kind of term.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
People use it interchangeably.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
There was this very famous study back in 2007 that got a lot of publicity

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that was done by Professor Christakis at Harvard

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and Professor Fowler at University of California, San Diego,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and they looked at how obesity is caused by influence,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that obesity is contagious.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
They have this thing where having an obese friend increases your chance

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
of obesity by 57%.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
That was when it got like everything was contagion.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Happiness was contagious, everything was contagious.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
There's all these--like Time magazine had a front cover,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and Wired magazine and all that.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Then when people looked more into the model they found that, well,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
wait a second.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
If I follow the model, then tallness is also contagious.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Unfortunately, it's not, because I would like to be taller, but I'm not.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It really gets down to this idea of correlation and causation.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Lots and lots of interesting work with real applications.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Like if I have a product that I want to spread through a network

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
or if I want people to change their behavior and stop smoking,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
is it influence or is it selection?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Because depending on which one it is, I should do either viral marketing or targeted outreach.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So, it's very important.
