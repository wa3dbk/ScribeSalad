00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.494
So, this seems really brain-dead. And before we go further on this, we should do

00:00:03.494 --> 00:00:07.360
a sanity check of whether this is actually practical. For a human, it certainly

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.512
wouldn't be. If the dates are a few years apart, you wouldn't want to count

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:14.302
every day. But what about a computer? So the question is roughly how long do you

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:18.130
think it would take, using this brain-dead approach, to count the number of days

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.613
in a hundred years between December 12, 1912, and December 12, 2012. So here are

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:26.514
the choices. A few nano seconds, that's a billionth of a second, a few

00:00:26.514 --> 00:00:30.999
milliseconds, that's a thousandth of a second, a few seconds, a few minutes, a

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.272
few hours, or way, way too long. This requires a little bit of guessing or

00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:37.103
thought but I think you should know enough to be able to get the correct answer.
