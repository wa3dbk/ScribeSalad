00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.925
P would equal positive 25, in this case. Great work if you found this number.

00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:09.834
Again, we'll start by converting logarithmic form into exponential form. So

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:16.807
we'll have 5 as our base, 2 as the exponent, set equal to p. Remember when we

00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:23.548
have log of base 5 of p equal to 2. We know that 5 raised to the second power

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:30.574
will equal p. So we really just need to evaluate 5 squared. 5 squared is 25, so

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:32.871
p equals 25.
