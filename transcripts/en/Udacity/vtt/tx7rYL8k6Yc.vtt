00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.730
In an arguably seminal 2011 blog post,
titled The Rise and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.640
Fall of HL7, Eliot Muir,
founder and CEO of Interfaceware,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.640
a major Toronto-based HL7 solution
provider wrote complicated

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.100
standards can be pushed for a while,
but ultimately markets reject them.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.010
Muir went on to recommend
a web services approach.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.210
Australian standards guru Grahame Grieve
added a simplified data model,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.200
based in part on HL7 RIM, and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.290
named it Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources, or FHIR.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.536
It's now a part of HL7 and

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:46.393
seems to be spreading like its homonym,
fire, F-I-R-E.

00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:51.910
I introduced FHIR way back in lesson one
as a universal health app platform and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.380
you're using it that way for
your team projects.
