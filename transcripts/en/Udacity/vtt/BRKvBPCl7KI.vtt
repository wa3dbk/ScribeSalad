00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.820
Before moving on, let's quickly recap
a few of the big ideas of this lesson.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.812
These ideas all stemmed from the fact
that graph partitioning is indeed

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:09.609
complete.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.780
That means you'll naturally want some
algorithms with good heuristics.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.460
Some of the heuristics that we talked
about included multi level partitioning,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.810
based on divide and conquer,
exploiting special structure,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.350
like plainarity, and the no gain
is pain improvement techniques,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.190
like what you saw in the KL algorithm.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.920
The last method we talked about
was spectral partitioning.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.669
That exploits the spooky relationship
between graphs, and matrices.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.570
Now, you might be confused about at
least one more thing in this lesson.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.830
Both KL, and spectral partitioning
are really expensive compared to

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.840
the original motivation for partitioning
which was a relatively cheap BFS.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.789
So, why would you ever partition for
BFS?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.240
To answer that question,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.200
you will need to think about how all
of the ideas in the lesson connect.
