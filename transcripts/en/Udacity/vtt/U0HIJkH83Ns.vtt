00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.620
All right, so we've established that we can do

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.870
this t-test and compute these t-values and nu values

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.490
and, and p-values in the abstract mathematical sense, but

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.380
you might be wondering how do I do this

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.280
in python? Is there a simple way to do

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.500
this? Well, the answer is yes, this can be

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.655
done in the following way. First you simply import

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:25.675
scipy.stats. And then you call scipy.stats.ttest_ind and then supply

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.735
as arguments two lists, which are your two

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:32.049
sets of data, and then an optional argument,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.220
equal_var=false. This indicates whether or not we think

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.422
the variance of our two samples is equal. This

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:41.980
equal_var=false argument makes this particular call of the

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.860
t-test equal to Welch's t-test. This function will

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.005
return a tuple. The first value is the

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.691
t-value for your data. And the second value is

00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.478
the corresponding p-value for a two-tailed test. The values

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:58.322
returned by scipy.stats.ttest_ind assumes that you are performing a

00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:01.546
two-sided t-test where we're only testing for whether the

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:04.519
means of our two samples are different. Say we

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.270
wanted to do a one-sided t-test, that is, we're

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.510
interested in testing whether one mean in particular is

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.330
greater than or less than the other. How might

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.420
we do this given the output that this function produces?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.220
Write your answer in the text box below. Here's a hint. We can still use

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.090
the t value and p value that this

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.640
function returns. Don't worry. This won't be graded.
