00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.820
Each of the projects involves solving a design problem in several ways.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.360
To determine which approach is best,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.080
you are asked to evaluate your solutions in a systematic way, that is,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.670
to conduct a design study. The result of each study is documented in

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.540
a report that conforms to a prescribed format laid out in a template file

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.190
linked to from the class resources page. We will now go through the contents of

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.560
the template as a way of illustrating what a software design study is all about.
