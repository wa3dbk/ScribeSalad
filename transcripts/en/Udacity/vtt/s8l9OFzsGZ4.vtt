00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.760
We're going to focus on relational
databases because this model is what

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.420
the databases that are widely used,
Oracle for example.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.840
The databases that are widely
used in real world,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.680
they actually use this relational model.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.410
So that's one reason we're
going to focus on it.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.760
It's also been around and
investigated heavily and so on.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.680
So what does a relational database,
what's the data model here?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.940
Well, a relational database consists
of what is called relations.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.100
Another name for relation is a table.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.170
Remember a table is basically,
it's sort of like rows and columns.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.400
It's a metrics kind of a structure.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.200
So relation is nothing but sort of
a table that has a bunch of columns, and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.720
bunch of rows.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.300
So what columns we have, what kind
of data items we're going to have

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.550
in the various columns,
in the database or in a relation.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.720
That's defined by a schema,
that we have for that relation.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.980
A schema basically says
what each column is.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.000
And what is the nature of the data?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.550
Is it a name, it's an address, it's a
social security number, whatever it is.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.880
The columns defined by
what we call attributes.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.910
So the values that we
store in the various

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.690
columns actually are attribute values.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.260
Think of about the schema defines what
these various columns of the table

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.360
are or the various attributes are.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.530
And value for a given attribute
is the attribute value.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.750
We talked about columns or
attributes, but of course,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.580
then we have rows in a table.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.580
The given row is going
to contain value for

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.890
each of the attributes as defined by
the schema that we're talking about.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810
So, it's column, row, cell of a metrics
in our table basically has a value.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.270
So, these rows are called Tuples.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.370
So tuples basically, as I said,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.340
are attribute values that make
up that row of the table.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.890
And what these values are, again,
is defined by the schema that we have.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.630
It's a table and the attribute values
and the rows are called tuples and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.050
things like that.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.169
Some of those attribute values are kind
of special, they're called keys.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.600
The various types of keys, primary and
foreign, and stuff like that.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.080
But keys are basically values that you
uniquely define a given tuple or a role.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.110
So, if the database stores
information about eight employee

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.550
there's going to be a tuple for
each employee.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.990
Information about that employee is
going to be stored in the table or

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.960
the relation given employees
information will define one tuple.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.030
And if you identify employees by,
let's say, their social security number,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.630
then that's going to be
the key value in that tuple.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.700
And it's uniquely identifies the tuple
because social security numbers

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.130
are different for different users.
