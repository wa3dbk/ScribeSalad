00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.430
We actually didn't need to
configure the Camera Roll.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.580
But, on a physical device,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.620
we could've modified it to get
an image using the camera.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340
For the Activity View,
we supplied an image to be shared.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.760
For the Alert View, we supplied
the title, message, and OK button.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.980
And, for the Dice View Controller,
we supplied the two die values.
