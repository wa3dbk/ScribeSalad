00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.039
Let's talk about the terminologies identified by Saltzer in his seminal paper

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:14.210
from 1975, that talks about the issues in computer security. The first issue

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.110
that is identified is when to release information. In this day and age,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.470
we all know the importance of privacy of information. And there is

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.960
a distinction between privacy of information and security. Privacy has to to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.970
with when, as individuals, we expect

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.720
to release information or. Prevent information for

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.580
being released. That's the individual's right

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.470
and responsibility in terms of information that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.520
they own. Security, on the other hand, is dealing with how to make

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.510
sure that the system is respecting the guarantees that the user needs

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.330
both in terms of. Privacy of information as well as when they want to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.590
release information. Said differently, privacy is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.260
more concerning the individual and the information

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.460
that they own, they possess, how

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.810
their information is protected and released when.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.550
And if an individual wants to release information. Security on the other hand,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.660
is a system function. The system

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.920
is guaranteeing certain properties about information that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.470
it is preserving on behalf of the user community. And in particular, the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.740
system has to protect information that belongs

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.475
to individuals. And ensure that those information

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:46.800
is released only when the individual that

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.655
owns that information wants it to be released.

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:56.001
So in this sense, there's an obligation for the system to ensure that users of

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.373
the system are authenticated. Meaning, that if

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:01.529
I go to the system and want to access

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:06.385
some information. The system has to ensure that

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:09.750
I am who I am. That's authentication, and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.330
then, it also has to make sure that whatever information I have access to,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.660
is something that is not violating any privacy of other individuals that may

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.310
have put information into the system. So,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.150
protection and authentication go hand in hand.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.020
And building a secure system. This also

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.130
identifies a comprehensive set of security concerns.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.470
The first security concern is unauthorized information

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.390
release. If I have put some information

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.760
into the system, then it is a responsibility of the system to make sure that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.120
the information that I've put in, is

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.140
not released without my authorization as the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.450
owner of the information. So that is

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.690
the first concern. The second concern is unauthorized

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.490
modification of information. I may have released it for a certain set of

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.260
users to access information that I've put into the system. But, I may not have

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.640
given authority for them to modify the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.800
information, so, unauthorized modification of information is

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.530
the second set of concerns. The third

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.690
security concern is unauthorized denial of use.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.620
What that means is. If I've given authority

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.830
to a set of users that they can access my information, there should be nothing

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.660
that prevents that set of authorized users from being able to access

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.340
that information. So that is what unauthorized denial of

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.010
use is concerned about. And you may be much more familiar with the term

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.250
Denial Of Service. That's exactly what this

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.990
particular concern is all about. In fact, this

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.640
is the first mention in the literature of Denial of Service attacks on a server,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.850
that prevents authorized users from being able to get service from the system.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.720
So what should be the goal of a secure system? Well the goal of a secure system

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.980
should be to make sure that all such violations do not occur. That

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.370
is, preventing all violations is the concern of a

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.480
secure system. But unfortunately stated this way, it's a negative statement,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.560
preventing all violations, that's insuring that

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.070
the system is somehow secure proof,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.320
meaning that nobody can attack the system.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.400
And because it's a negative statement it's hard

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.810
to achieve. It's sort of like saying there, are no bugs in my program. There

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.710
is no way to prove that a program has no bugs. And in a similar manner there, is

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:08.840
no way to assure that the system prevents all violations. So what

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.650
Saltzer argues is, the goal of the secure system should

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.590
not be stated negatively, but positively. If the goal of the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.580
secured system is stated in this negative manner that it

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.560
has to prevent all violations. At best, it can give a

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.220
false sense of security because there is no way to assure

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.950
that bad guys are not going to break into

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.430
the system. So, making a statement like my system

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.850
prevents all violation, is giving a false sense

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.670
of security because it is not achievable in practice.
