00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.685
So, let's just go through these answers 1 by 1 to figure out which ones are

00:00:04.697 --> 00:00:09.771
correct. Starting off with 2z, we see that this is something that is multiplied

00:00:09.783 --> 00:00:14.648
by 5x and by 7y in order to equal this term. So, this is definitely a radiance

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.270
here. Now when we look at 5, we need to remember, again. Invisible

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:25.515
multiplication sign between the 5 and the x. If we multiply 5 by x and 7y and

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:31.740
2z, then we get this whole term. So 5 is also a factor. Now 1 is where things

00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:37.605
get a little bit tricky and if you miss this one Not a big deal. This actually

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:42.235
is a factor of this term, and actually, of any term. The reason that 1 is a

00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:46.860
factor for any term we might have, whether it's a number or a variable, is

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:51.555
because if you multiply 1 by that term itself, you will end up with the term

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:56.345
that you're looking for. So in our case, the thing that we need to multiply 1

00:00:56.357 --> 00:01:01.398
by, in order to get 5x times 7y times 2z is just this term itself. I know that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.828
might seem a little bit complicated right now, but you'll have plenty of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.766
practice in the upcoming quizzes, to sort this all out. Bottom line, 1 is always

00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:15.696
a factor. Now at first you might think that 0 is similar to 1 in this way. But 0

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:20.606
is actually not a factor here. We can't divide this expression by 0. That would

00:01:20.618 --> 00:01:25.422
actually give us a solution that we don't know how to interpret right now. And

00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:30.376
there's nothing that we can multiply by 0 in order to get this expression, since

00:01:30.388 --> 00:01:35.085
0 times anything is just equal to 0. So, 0 should not be checked off. We know

00:01:35.097 --> 00:01:39.420
that y is multiplied by 7. And also by 5X and 2Z to come up with this term. So

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:43.350
we should check that one off as well, and X works in the same way so we've

00:01:43.362 --> 00:01:47.735
checked everything off except for the 0. That was great, I know that factors are

00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:52.490
alittle bit trickier than terms so I hope that this vocabulary is starting to

00:01:52.502 --> 00:01:56.175
make a little bit more sense. We'll keep using it really frequently.
