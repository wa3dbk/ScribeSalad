00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.130
We know that the exponent needs to distribute to both factors that are

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.547
multiplied together to make up this term. So this equals 3 squared times i

00:00:08.547 --> 00:00:13.066
squared. We know that 3 squared is just 9, and we know that i squared is just

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.788
negative 1. So 3i squared equals negative 9.
