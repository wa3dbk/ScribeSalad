00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.894
One example of a technique to actually improve the

00:00:02.894 --> 00:00:06.410
ILP of the program is tree height reduction. Let's consider

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.940
a program that looks like this. Let's say that

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.280
we need a sum of these four registers in R8.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.400
One way to get that is to add the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.012
first two numbers into R8, and then add the second

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:21.288
number, and then add the third number and then

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:25.570
the fourth number. However, this forms a dependence chain because

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.930
we have the dependence here and the dependence here, so

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.189
really these instructions have to be done one after the other.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.478
So tree height reduction works as follows. The compiler figures

00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:37.878
out that instead of adding one number at a time to

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:40.818
the sum, and thus creating a chain of dependencies, what

00:00:40.818 --> 00:00:43.830
we can do is we can group the computation this way.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.358
Thus, getting, we first add the first two numbers and put

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:50.510
that in R8. Then we add the second pair of numbers,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.800
put that in R7. And then we add up the R8

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.610
and R7 into our final result, R8. The dependencies here are

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.600
this and this. So, now we have two instructions that can

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.010
execute in parallel with each other because they don't depend on

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.340
each other. And then a third instruction that does depend on

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.680
them, too. So if this needed three cycles to execute, this

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.453
can actually execute in two cycles if we have a processor

00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:15.602
that can do at least two instructions per cycle. Tree height

00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:20.778
reduction can not always be done. It uses associativity of the addition

00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:27.120
operation, and you have to keep in mind that not all operations are associative.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.483
So we have to be careful. We can only do this when the

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:34.750
final result is the same as if we did things in the proper order.
