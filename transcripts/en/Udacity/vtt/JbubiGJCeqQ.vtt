00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A more tricky question--what do you think for this coin flip is the variance of the outcome?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's the question you never really asked, and it's okay to get it wrong or punt on it,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but perhaps you can give it a try.

00:00:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The math is very similar to the math that I provided here.
