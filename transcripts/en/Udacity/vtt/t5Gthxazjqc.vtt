00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.520
Okay, so let's go into some more details on

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.870
Cloud Endpoints. You probably remember this picture from lesson

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.700
two, where we introduced Cloud Endpoints, and where we

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.570
described this capability to create one API that you

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.230
could use to create client applications for many different

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.580
devices. Well you may wonder now, why is Cloud

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.740
Endpoints any different from a pure HTTP protocol? For

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.700
example, a REST API. Well, let's look at that.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.210
When using Cloud Endpoints, it allows the development

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.380
environment to inspect and be aware of your

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.960
API. This has multiple values. First of all,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.690
application design. When designing your backend application, you can

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.330
focus on the high level application design and

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.730
you don't need to think about low level communication

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.905
syntax and semantics. Cloud endpoints also performs native

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:50.510
client library generation for a number of different languages.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.630
This helps out greatly, with a number of

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.250
different things. For example, communication and establishing connectivity and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.510
error management, so you don't have to deal with

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.880
low level communication errors. But also, higher level functions

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.510
such as user authentication that we use for Conference

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.120
Central. And also, since your API can be expected,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.350
Google can provide many tools around it. The API

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.740
Explorer is just one example of such a tool,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.700
which is extremely useful. So Cloud Endpoints is a

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.460
great way to develop APIs that are rock solid,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.520
easy to use, portable across devices and languages. And

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.600
can be used with tools, such as the API

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.860
explorer. Great value here in other words, since it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.270
let's you focus on your app and let Google

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.060
take care of all the low level details. Let's

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.740
now look at cloud endpoints in your development environment.
