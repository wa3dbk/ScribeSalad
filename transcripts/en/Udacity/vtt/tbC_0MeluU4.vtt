What do you think the outcome was for Tiffany Field's study? Babies without the

00:00:03.398 --> 00:00:07.630

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.650
babies who did receive the touch treatment left the hospital sooner, and gained

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.582
weight faster than the babies who weren't touched. Or, there was no difference

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:20.394
