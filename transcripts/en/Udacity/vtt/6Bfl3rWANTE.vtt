00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.450
Having seen an example for n equals
four, now let's state the Fast Fourier

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.280
transform precisely for
the general case.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.410
As input, we have a sequence of numbers,
a 0 through a n minus one, or

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.880
N is a power of two, and we want to
return the values of the corresponding

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.490
polynomial at the nth roots of unity.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.070
We'll state this as
a recursive algorithm, and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.690
the base case is where n is equal to 1.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.950
And in that case, we want to return
the single element sequence,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.360
consisting just of a 0,
the constant term.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.420
If n is greater than 1, then we call
the Fast Fourier transformer cursively.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.320
Once with the even coefficients.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.900
And once with the odds.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.940
Then we combine the results,
taking care of paired values together.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.030
Notice the difference in the sign on
the contribution from the odd powers,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.660
which became S prime.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.370
How long does this take?

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.156
Well, we traded one problem of size
N for two problems of size N over 2,

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:11.538
plus some order N work for
all the arithmetic in this loop.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:16.690
By the master theorem, this gives us
a running time of order and log in.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.570
This is much better then
the N squared running time,

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.600
from the naive evaluation by Horner's
rule or by matrix multiplication.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.610
There's one other wrinkle that I
want to add to the algorithm, and

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.130
that is to say that this
omega parameter here,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.220
can really be any primitive
nth root of unity.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.620
All that matters is that all
the powers be distinct, and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.340
that those be the roots of unity.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.560
So we can add this as a parameter
to our algorithm as well.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.140
We now take in as well, that omega is
a primitive nth root of unity, and

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.340
we'll use that in our
update rules in here.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.100
We'll see how this comes in handy later.
