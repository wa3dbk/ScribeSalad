What if instead of finding how many times a value occurs in a user input we

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.474
wanted to find out how many times a particular digit appears? For example, in

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:12.820
this number 3 appears twice as a digit. You can start with this number class

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.464
and implement the count matching digits method. Notice, digit to match is a

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:22.553
digit, like 3, that you're looking for. And number is the number you're

00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:24.398
searching in.
