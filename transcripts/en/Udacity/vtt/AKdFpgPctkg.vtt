00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.040
Let's take a quick look at an example response.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.610
Here is the status line indicating the HTTP version number

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.290
and a response code, OK. The date the response

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.710
was sent, the server that served the request, some cookies

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.370
that are used to set some state on the

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.150
client. For example whether or not the client is logged

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.780
in or not, when the page expires, when it was

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.320
last modified and some more instructions about how the page

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.610
can or cannot be cached. There's also a content type header

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.299
to indicate that the response is coming back in HTML format.
