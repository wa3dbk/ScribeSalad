00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And now for the answer--c was a less than sign.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This part of the condition is true, but this line was not executed. Instead this line was executed.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And therefore, this whole condition must have been false.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Since it was false, quote must have been true because that's the value

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which turns the entire condition to false.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is the correct answer.
