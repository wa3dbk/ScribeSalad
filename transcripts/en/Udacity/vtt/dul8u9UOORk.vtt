00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.000
It's often desirable to bring together
data from many sources and providers.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.050
But they may be cautious about
participating because of concerns

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.319
about how their data will be used and
whether their institution might

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.721
be portrayed negatively or
look bad in some analyses.

00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:21.804
One solution, as depicted here for
PopMedNet, is for

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:26.689
each contributing institution to
maintain control of its data in

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.659
what is often called a data locker,
but be capable of accepting and

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.600
responding to queries that
might go to many data sources.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.000
PopMedNet is intended to support
medical product safety analysis and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.290
comparative effectiveness
research of alternate treatments,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.610
both of which rest on obtaining data
from multiple sources and other studies.
