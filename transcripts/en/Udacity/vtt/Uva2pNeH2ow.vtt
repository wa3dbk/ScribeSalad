00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.210
So defining the postcondition for
permutation is a little tricky.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.440
Here's one answer that is worth
studying to ensure yourself that you

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.350
truly understand how a formal
specification might look.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.460
We will break down the specification
of permutation into several different

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.425
special cases.

00:00:14.425 --> 00:00:16.980
Okay?
And this is a typical approach for

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.100
tricky specifications or even for tricky
programs, is to break them down into

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.670
special cases and handle each one
of those special cases by itself.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.782
Okay, the first case to look at
is when both vectors are empty.

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:33.800
We already know that the lengths are the
same, so if we say, we can check whether

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.740
they're empty by just checking whether
the length of the vector x equals zero.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.110
And, in that case,
we already talked about this,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.550
we will say that they have the same,
well no we didn't talk about it.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.550
We talked about it with order.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.820
So, if we have an empty vector and
we know that the lengths are the same,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.390
that's saying we're going to
have an empty vector as output,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.130
is that output vector
a permutation on the input vector?

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.980
It is.
Okay.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.480
So, special case number one,
the length of the input vector is zero.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.170
We will say, in fact, that the output
is a permutation of the input.
