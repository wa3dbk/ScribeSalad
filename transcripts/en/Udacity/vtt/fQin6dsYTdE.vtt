00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.310
The first scheduling policy is a very simple

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.390
one, first come, first serve. And what this

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.330
is saying is that you look at the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.760
order of arrival of threads into the scheduling queue

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.219
of the scheduler and pick the one that

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.040
is the earliest to become runnable again. And that's

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.850
the one that you're going to schedule. So what

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.670
this is saying is, well basically we will give

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.480
importance to fairness for threads as opposed to affinity.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.680
So it is ignoring affinity altogether and simply saying

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.460
let's just be fair. We'll pick the thread that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.450
became runnable at the earliest, that's the one that we're

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.990
going to pick as the next one to run on

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.460
the processor. That's first come, first served. The second

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.870
scheduling policy is called fixed processor, or in other

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.720
words, for every thread, when I schedule the thread the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.670
first time, I'm going to pick a particular

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.450
processor. And I'm always going to stick to that.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.400
So the processor on which Ti will run

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.380
will always be a particular fixed processor. And

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.590
the, the, the, way we choose the initial processor on which to schedule Ti may

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.880
depend on the, load balance. Making sure that

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.740
all the processors in the multiprocessor are equally

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.020
stressed in terms of, using the resources for

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.300
running the available threads that are there in the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.380
system. And that's how I pick a particular

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.470
processor but you, for the life of this thread,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.380
the processor on which Ti is going to run

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.480
is always fixed. So that's fixed processor scheduling. The

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.892
third scheduling policy is what is called a

00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:40.870
last proccessor scheduling policy. The idea here is the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.680
processor is going to pick among the set of threads

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.170
that are available to be run at any point

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.304
of time. It is going to pick a thread that

00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:53.545
used to run on it. In other words, if TI

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:57.260
the last time it had any cycles from the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.030
system was on a particular processor. Then, when this

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.020
processor is coming around looking for work, it'll see

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.450
oh, Ti is there, he used to run on me.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.090
I'm going to pick that guy to run on me again. And

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.520
as you can imagine, this is giving preference to the fact

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.670
that there could be affinity for Ti to this processor, because

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.670
it used to run on this. So that is what is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.340
called last processor scheduling, and of course when a processor is

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.790
looking for work and it looks at the run queue, does

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.120
not find any thread that used to run on it, and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.470
of course it has to pick some thread, right? So the,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.300
the inclination is to pick the thread that had

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.020
run on this processor before. And, and that's the one

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.310
that I want to schedule on P last. But

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.150
if such a thread is not available, then you're going to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.900
pick something else. So, the idea behind this is

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.038
that, you want to make sure that if this processor

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:51.745
is going to pick a thread to run on it, the

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:57.050
likelihood of this thread finding its memory contents in this

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.478
processor is high. That's, that's what we're trying

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:01.960
to shoot for in this last processor. The next

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.140
couple of scheduling policies I'm going to tell you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.770
about. It requires more sophistication in terms of the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.960
information that the scheduler needs to keep on

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.744
behalf of every thread. You know in order to

00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:17.040
make a scheduling decision. The next scheduling policy is

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.460
what is called minimum Intervening policy. MI for short.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.870
And in MI, what we're going to do is the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.060
following. We're going to keep, for every thread, it's affinity with

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.160
respect to a particular processor, and pick the processor for

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.590
running this thread in which this thread has the highest affinity.
