00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.490
So here, let's actually build this
by simply using the two image pairs.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.750
Now, if you notice in these two image
pairs, the object of interest has

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.015
significantly changed, but some of the
local details are, of course, the same.

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:20.170
Notice the same toy giraffe, and we
can basically see some of the details,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.050
even though, of course, some of
the details are significantly different.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.790
Also, in this case,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.310
just to prove a point,
that the intensities are also different.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.090
First, of course, by running through it,
we basically now want to come and

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.120
compute the color response function
as we've looked at this image.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.300
This basically starts giving us all of
these responses, and I've just colored,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.890
I mapped them a little bit to point out
where the higher cost-functions are,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.190
which are all of the bright red ones,
and

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.410
that's where most of the interesting
corners have been found in this image.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.180
And again, they are found
in both these image pairs.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.290
Of course, now we can actually
take those bright spots, and

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.330
find points with the largest
corner response.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.070
In essence, now that basically says,
I know what the R value is, I'm going to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.415
threshold out and get rid of everything
else that's below a certain threshold.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:10.265
That allows me to find these
regions again in both of them

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:13.815
that are just a higher rate,
or higher intensity, of Rs.

00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:14.945
This image should be hard for

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:18.115
you to see because the points
are now very small in here.

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:19.575
Let's start to zoom in.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:23.515
But basically, this is finding
the local maximum of each and

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.185
every point that we have looked at.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.765
And again, at this scale,
they get to be really small.

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's zoom in.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.650
And if you zoom in,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.010
you should be able to see some simple
white spots all over this image.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.980
Don't fret if you don't see them,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.030
because what I've done now is basically
just use contrast announcement and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.530
now you can see these points here.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.300
Of course,
they're still kind of hard to see.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.050
So let's look at them overlaid.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.490
So, in this case now I've basically
taken the same image again, pair, and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.530
here you can see small red spots here.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.590
Of course, some are found here.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.400
That region is not there, so,
of course, they're not found here.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.130
But you can see, for example,
there are some features at the nose.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.710
There are some features
at the tips up there.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.910
And you can see similar features, and
actually, now you can start seeing

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.850
that it found features here and
here, and also found features, for

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.870
example, here and there, even though
the image is a little darker.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.800
So this is the output we're looking at.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.710
We want to find features like this.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.680
That's what we want to do
with Harris detection.
