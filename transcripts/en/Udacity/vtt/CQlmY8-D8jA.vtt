The answer is the third option. The default parameters get initialized when

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.320
functions are defined. We have to be really careful if we use a default

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.064
parameter that's a mutable object, which is the case with a list. So, this same

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:15.453
object gets reused every time the functions called without passing a parameter.
