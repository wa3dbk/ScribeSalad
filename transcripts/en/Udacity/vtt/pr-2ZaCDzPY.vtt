00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.930
In reporting confidence intervals, we need the following pieces of information.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.950
We need to know the confidence level. For example 95%. We need to know the

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.572
lower limit. And we need to know the upper limit. And of course, make sure you

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:15.252
identify what the confidence interval is for. In other words, what are we doing

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:18.750
with the confidence interval. What is it telling us? Is it a confidence

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.682
interval on a single mean? Or a confidence interval on the difference between

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:24.289
two means, for example? Be clear.
