Okay.

00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:04.406
What I want you to do is come up with the area of each of these squares. So,

00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:08.435
find the area of this square, this square and then, this square has four

00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:12.791
different regions. I want you to find the area of each one. So, for example, to

00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:17.109
find the area of this part, I know that this side is 5 and I know that this side

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:21.808
is the same as this side, which is same as this side. So, 5 times 5, or 25. You

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.275
multiply the sides of a rectangle or a square to get the area. Go ahead, fill in

00:00:27.287 --> 00:00:28.520
these other areas.
