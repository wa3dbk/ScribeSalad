00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.140
This project begins like
most development projects,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.760
with a list of new
technologies to learn.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.960
This can be a daunting stage in
a project, but it can be exciting, too.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.880
Let's walk through the list.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.580
In order to build MemeMe 1.0,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.600
you'll need to be able to pick an image
using a UI image picker controller.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.946
You'll need to be able to edit and
display text with a particular style,

00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:25.586
move the view to accommodate
the keyboard, and

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:27.702
share a meme using the activity view.

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:34.322
And when you're done, you'll have a meme
editor with the ability to create and

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:34.950
share a meme.
