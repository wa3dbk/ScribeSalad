Before we attempt our problem, let's review mixed numbers and improper fractions.

00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:08.695
Mixed numbers are a way to count objects when we have a couple of objects and a

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:12.890
part of that object. So here I have 2 doughnuts and then I have 2 thirds of one.

00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:17.215
I can think about splitting up a whole doughnut into 3 equal pieces, or thirds,

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:21.625
and then I'd have 2 thirds. So our entire mixed number would be 2 and 2 thirds.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:25.805
Notice we have a mixture of whole numbers and fractions. That's why we call

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:30.120
these mixed numbers. If I split all of my donuts up into thirds, I can count the

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:34.240
pieces and I would have 8 thirds, that would be the improper fraction. It's

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:38.430
improper because the number in the numerator is higher than the number in the

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:43.327
denominator. So, let's see how we can go from the mixed number to the improper

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.321
fraction. If I take my whole doughnuts, and split them up into thirds, I would

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.452
have six of them. 6 3rds.

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:54.630
I can get that by multiplying 3 times 2. I still have 2 3rds left over. So I

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:59.187
need to add this 2 3rds to my 6 3rds. 6 plus 2 makes 8, so I get 8 3rds.

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:04.066
Let's try going the other way. I can think about splitting 8 3rds into 6 3rds

00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:09.052
and 2 3rds. Notice that the 6 3rds represents my two whole doughnuts. I know 6

00:01:09.064 --> 00:01:14.019
divided by 3 makes 2, and then I have my 2 3rds left over. So 2 and 2 3rds. This

00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:18.933
also makes sense because I know 3 goes into 8 two full times, and then I would

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.487
have a remainder of 2 or 2 3rds left over.
