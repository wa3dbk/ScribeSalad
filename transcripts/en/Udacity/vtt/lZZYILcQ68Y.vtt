00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:04.200
Now we are going to do a slightly
more detailed directory example,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.039
to show how the directory doesn't
become a bottleneck when a bus would.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.530
Here we have four cores,
each with its own cache and also,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.570
next to each core is
a slice of the directory.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.050
Let's assume that each slice
just keeps track of one block.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.560
So this is the directory slice where
we keep the block X information,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.033
and then next to cache one
there is directory Y, Z and W.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:35.114
And now let's assume that
the core 0 write X at about

00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:39.859
the same time,
where core 1 is trying to read Y.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.794
This is a cache miss, and we send
the request to the directory that is

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:50.620
the home for X, which happens to be
around nearby slice of the directory.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.180
When we read Y we go to our own slice.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.640
Let's say that cache 2 also
reads Y at about the same time.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.450
So what happens now is the write to X,
and

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.440
the read to Y here are probably going to
be processed at about the same time,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.070
completely independently
by these directories.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.050
Meanwhile, the read Y is travelling
through the network to this directory.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.670
In each of these directories, we see
that the block is not present in any of

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.370
the caches, so we allow exclusive access
for the read, and here, of course,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.004
the block will be modified, anyway, so
here, we will set the dirty bit and

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:36.240
note that block X is now in the cache 0,
and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.880
here we will set the dirty bit because
exclusive can become dirty easily, and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.820
set the presence bit for cache 1.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.100
Now the read Y is traveling
to this directory,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.375
let's say that cache 1 is being
accessed with a write to X and

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:54.725
it's a cache miss so
it gets sent to this directory.

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:57.405
So this will probably arrive here first.

00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:01.425
We will check the presence vector and
the dirtiness information and

00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:06.175
see that cache 1 is the one that has the
data, and that it might be dirty there.

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:10.100
So we forward the request
to read to cache 1.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.600
Cache 1 acknowledges that request,
changes its state to shared,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.187
we get the response that
it doesn't carry data,

00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:22.170
so now we know that the block was not
dirty, and we change it to not dirty.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.630
We then get the data and forward it
to cache 2, and now we know also that

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.390
cache 2 might have the data, and that
cache 2 eventually will get the data,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.538
so it will eventually get
the shared state and the block Y.

00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:43.045
Meanwhile, the write X is getting here,
and because we need to write we're

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:48.220
going to send an invalidation and
an external write request to cache 0,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.780
so here the cache needs to responds with
the data because it's a write request,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.530
it sets the state to invalid and
responds with the data.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.430
This is also a write, so the block will
remain dirty, but now the directory

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.230
knows that cache 0 no longer has the
data, and we send the data to cache 1.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.710
So now the cache 1 will eventually get
the data in the modified state, and, as

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.080
you can see, the write to X and the read
to Y are largely proceeding independent

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.290
of each other, except for maybe
possible connection in the network.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.100
So, if our network is good and has many
different paths between these caches and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.270
directories, then really,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.020
there was no point where these requests
competed with each other for anything.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.380
This one was processed by this cache and
this directory, this one was processed

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.970
by this cache and this directory, and
we involved other caches if necessary.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.410
But in this case, it was this cache, so

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.210
these requests were still
largely independent.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.630
Now let's say we want to
write to Y in this cache.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.980
This will be sent to the directory for
Y.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.760
So the message travels over here.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.964
The directory for
Y now sees that caches 1 and

00:03:57.964 --> 00:04:01.650
2 might have the data and
that none of them are dirty, so

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.710
it just sends the invalidation
request to caches 1 and 2.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.280
When they receive this
invalidate the block Y and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.850
send back responses that
indicate that they have done so.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.410
When the first response arrives from,
let's say, cache 1,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.170
the directory eliminates this bit.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.600
When the second response comes,
the directory eliminates this bit.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.030
Now that we know there are no more
remaining sharers we can send the data

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.790
to the requesting writer and note
that it's going to have the block and

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.600
that the block will be dirty.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.900
So now we send the block over here and

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.160
this block becomes modified here and
so on.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.220
So again this write only
involved the caches and

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.630
the directory entry that actually
needed to be involved for this block.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.820
This cache and directory, for example,
were completely operating independently

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.890
of this, and these two directories
could've done something else.
