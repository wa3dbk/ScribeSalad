00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.490
As you observed in the previous exercise,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.850
even when you define the width of the divs, they still were

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.040
displayed one under another, as if they were taking the whole width of the page.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.480
This isn't what you want,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.670
meaning that you need to do some positioning of the boxes.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.180
There's a lot of power in CSS to position elements.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.650
However, it is probably one of the most complicated concepts about CSS.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.040
Now, we'll just cover one powerful technique, and

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.229
that's how to use the flex box layout.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.380
Flex box means flexible box and it provides an efficient way to lay out,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.060
align, and distribute space among items in a container or div.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.530
Now remember in our mock layout that we have our image next to our description.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.480
If you want several elements to be next to each other,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.080
you can change the display attribute of the parent container to value flex.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.229
Looking here at our app, we have our parent div class app.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.360
And here we can add display flex.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.990
Wow!

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.660
That made the child elements try and align next to each other.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.910
For it to work you also have to give the items a size that

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.660
is smaller than the default 100%.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.620
But you already did that in the last exercise.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.910
Be sure to check out all of the cool features of flex box in

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.890
the links included in the instructor note section.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.860
Then it's time for

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.600
you to use this magic and finally make the boxes on your page behave properly
