One further nuance to mention about associations, is the idea of links.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.791
Just like classes can have instances, associations can have links. For

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:17.746
example, if we had the situation where a company hires people,

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:24.676
we might have a situation where IBM hires Bob. IBM hires Alice.

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:32.900
Hewlett-Packard hires Tom. Hewlett-Packard hires Alice.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.450
She has two, two jobs. In this situation, we would have four different links.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.800
One for each pair involved in the association. Notice in this particular

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.970
diagram that in addition to indicating all of the particular instances

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.730
of the classes, that the lines here are going to indicate links.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.830
That is lines between rectangles for

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.379
which the rectangles are instances indicate links, that participate

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.180
in association. Notice also that we have role names here and we have qualifiers.
