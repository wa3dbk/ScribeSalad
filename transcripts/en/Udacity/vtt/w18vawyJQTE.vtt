00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.457
Finally, I want to say a word about collaboration-based design.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.860
When we did object-oriented analysis, we were essentially picking out

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.030
the important objects in the description of the real world.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.480
And we're using those as the basis of deciding on classes and and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.160
the associations among them.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
And eventually we got to the stage where we were mentioning methods that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.425
the classes might provide as services.

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:32.659
Collaboration-based design takes a somewhat contrary approach to things.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.100
In particular it's concerned, it starts with use cases.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.350
Individual use cases sometimes called user stories or scenarios.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.240
And with these use cases,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.000
each use case has various actors playing a specific role for that use case.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.510
Collaboration design, by the way, is sometimes called role-based design.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.270
So we can say that for a particular actor, participating in

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.710
a particular use case, that actor's fulfilling some kind of role.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.220
So let's specify that role.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.840
That role takes the form of the actions that,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.540
that user takes in that user's story.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.349
Once we have catalogued those actions, okay,

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:20.220
we can then examine other use cases that involve that same actor.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.620
And from the set of activities which that actor under,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.870
undergoes in the various use cases, we have built up a set of roles and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.570
the combination of that set of roles is in fact going to

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.290
be what the overall capabilities that that class must provide.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.050
So we can synthesize the classes from the set of roles we've

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.880
defined during this, this process.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.340
I'm not going to go into role-based design any further,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.950
but you may come across it in the literature or

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.180
you may want to look into it more yourself and, and try it out.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.860
Because it can be an alternative approach that

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.380
might be helpful under some circumstance
