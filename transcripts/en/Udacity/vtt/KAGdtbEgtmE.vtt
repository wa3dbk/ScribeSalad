00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.050
All right, you're done. 
There were a lot of new things

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.990
that time. 
But, after all,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.530
you're becoming a seasoned 
Android programmer by now.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.430
As I mentioned before, 
we're going to use

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.520
NotificationCompat.Builder 
to build our notification.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.000
It's easy to build a nice looking 
notification that has our icon

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.220
representing the weather forecast, 
the title for our app.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.330
And our content text, the forecast 
with highs and lows.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.600
We're going to use another class

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.130
from the support library, 
to create a task stack builder

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.960
for our pending intent. 
This is a simple case

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.880
of task stack builder, 
because all we have

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.710
is a single item on our stack. 
We just add the next intent

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.700
and use it to build out pending intent

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.480
that we pass 
into the notification manager.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.150
Finally we call the notification manager 
with the built intent from our builder,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.088
with a notify function. 
One of the great things

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:56.964
about notification manager 
is it can be used from any thread

00:00:56.964 --> 00:00:58.948
even though it is displaying UI.
