00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.540
With the view transform in place, we now have all our coordinates in the

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.540
cameras frame of reference. What we now want to do is define a box in this

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.358
space to contain everything we're going to render. It's sort of like defining

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:13.339
the size of a stage. As noted before, the orthographic camera's definition is

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.890
to give a left, right, top, bottom, near, far set of values to define this box.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.578
These six numbers define the corners of a rectangular box in the view space of

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:24.390
your camera. The first time I explained it, we made a box and then oriented it

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.618
in space. What's happening as far as the matrices go is the reverse. We first

00:00:28.618 --> 00:00:32.009
orient the world to the camera's view of things. Then define our box with

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.296
respect to the camera. In practical terms we usually make the left and right

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:39.066
the opposites, along with the top and bottom. The near value is often zero,

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.503
though can be any number. The idea is that the view matrix moved everything in

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:46.015
the world to be placed relative to the lens of our camera. Creating the

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:50.022
orthographic camera itself, makes a projection matrix. The box defined by the

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:52.882
projection matrix is then in front of the camera and symmetric around its view

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:57.792
axis. This box called the view volume in fact performs a projection. We're not

00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:00.564
just defining a box, we're saying take everything in this box and project it

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:04.804
onto the plus z side of the box and make an image. You may have been wondering

00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:07.660
why are we looking down the negative z angle axis. This is done because it

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.500
makes for a right handed coordinate system for the camera. The y direction is

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.536
up. X is to the right. Giving a Cartesian coordinate system for the image

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:18.725
formed. To keep things right handed, the z axis must be pointing toward the

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:23.482
viewer. Meaning we have to look down the negative z axis. That said, three j s

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:27.700
thinks about the orthographic camera is going in a positive direction. So the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.140
far value is specified as a distance along the negative z axis. Our chain of

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.706
matrixes adds this projection to the front. In other words, the projection is

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:38.715
applied next. When applied, a coordinate will get a new value in this

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:42.800
projection's frame of reference. This frame uses what are called Normalized

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.201
Device Coordinates or NDC for short. These NDC coordinates are in the range

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:51.304
from -1 to 1 for X, Y, and Z. We'll talk more about this transform in a minute,

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:53.988
but the point is, is that whatever is inside the box will have coordinates

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.320
transformed to this new range.
