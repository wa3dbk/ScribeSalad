00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.664
The correct answer is 15. We know, from the Pythagorean Theorem, that the sum of

00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:10.779
the squares of either of the shorter sides of the triangle is equal the square

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:15.798
of the hypotenuse. So, in the case of this triangle, that means that we have 9

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:19.770
squared plus 12 squared equals something squared. We want to find out what c is.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:24.364
Simplifying the left side of our equation gives us 225 equals c squared. Now

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:28.682
it's really easy at this point to think, oh my gosh, I found our answer. But

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:33.139
remember, we're not looking for c squared, we're looking for just c on its own.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.608
We just want the length of this side, not its square. So how do we handle this?

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:42.064
How do I get rid of this exponent of 2? Well, we need to talk a little bit more

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:46.799
about exponents, so we can figure out how to deal with this. What we need to do

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:51.647
is to take the square root of both sides. You've probably worked with square

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.808
roots before and the power of the square root is just transform, in this case, c

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.848
squared to just c. It also changes 225 into 15. We'll elaborate on square roots

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.871
in just a minute.
