This wasn't too hard.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.350
The green box and the light blue box,
both have widths of 50%,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.040
because they take up half
the width of the container, but

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.990
all the other boxes like the dark blue,
the red, and the orange,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.400
all take up the full width of
the container, so they're at 100% width.
