00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So what did we achieve in this unit?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We found a differential equation that governs the motion of that spacecraft

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
around the earth and around the moon.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And we know a simple solution method to solve differential equations

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
on the computer--the forward Euler method.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But there is lots of stuff left for Unit 2.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We have to actually solve that differential equation,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and it turns out the forward Euler method isn't quite the method to be using.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We have to actually solve the differential equation by computer.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And it turns out the forward Euler method is somewhat too simple for that purpose.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And of course, we have to eventually find a trajectory that's going to bring Apollo 13 back to earth.
