00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So a very simple way--not really efficient, but it works--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is to open the file, read all the lines which then come in an array indexed by 0,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then we simply take the line number minus 1.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the array, the lines start with 0;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
however, in our trace the lines start with number 1.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And since the lines already contain the required new-line character,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we put in a comma at the end to suppress the second new-line character

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that would otherwise be issued by the print statement.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's try this out.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We run the whole thing, and now with every line

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the file name should be opened, line should be read,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and the one, single executed line should be printed.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We run the whole thing, and this is what we get.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You see the first tag is false, being executed,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
then quote is false, being executed,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
out being set to the empty string is being executed,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and here now you can see the entire program

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
one by one as it produces the output.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And this is then what makes the actual trace of the program.
