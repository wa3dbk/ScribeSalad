00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.220
So this is our continuing solution for

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.010
this multipart quiz. We have begun issuing instruction MUL 4,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.360
so the question is now, what goes into the fields of the reservation station?

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.610
And also, which RAT entries going to modified? The modification of the RAT entry

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.780
is going to be easy because it's going to be the RAT entry for R1. So

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.060
the correct answer here is R1. The RAT entry for R1 is going to be modified, and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.115
we modified with ROB4. Before we do that,

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:34.775
however, we need to read out what is the RAT content for R1 and R2.

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:40.358
And we find that it's ROB2 and ROB1. So, the answer here is going to be that,

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:46.844
this reservation station entry for the multiplication is going to have two tags,

00:00:46.844 --> 00:00:52.420
for R1, ROB2, for R2, ROB1. And it's not going to have either of the values.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.730
We would only put something here if we could actually get their actual value

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.920
from wherever it is. But because we need to wait for ROB2 to get the value and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.239
we need to wait for ROB1 to get that value, which simply leave these empty.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.190
So that concludes the correct answering for this part of the quiz.
