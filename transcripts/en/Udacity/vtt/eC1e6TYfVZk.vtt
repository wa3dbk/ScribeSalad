00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.270
In this lesson, we will talk just briefly

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.689
about buffer bloat. We saw an example of

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.260
buffer bloat in the last lesson where we

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.840
explored the latency effects of power boost. In the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.730
example we explored, the sender could send at

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.540
a rate R that was bigger than the sustained

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.140
rate R without seeing packet loss. Now if

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.540
there's a buffer in the network that can support

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.710
this higher rate, what we'll see is that buffer

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.330
will start filling up with packets. But this buffer

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.470
can still only drain at the sustained rate R.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.730
So even though the sender might be able to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.840
send at a faster rate for a brief period

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.380
of time in terms of throughput, all of those

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.080
packets that the sender sent at that faster rate

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.100
are queued up in line waiting to be sent.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.470
As these packets are waiting in this buffer,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.830
they'll see higher delays than they would see

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.200
if they simply arrived at the front of

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.470
the queue and could be sent immediately. The delay

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.040
that the packet will see in the buffer is the amount of data in the buffer

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.610
divided by the rate that the buffer can

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.410
drain. These large buffers can introduce delays that ruin

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.690
the performance for time-critical applications such as

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.110
voice and video. These large buffers actually show

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.600
up all over the place. In home routers, in home WiFi devices or access points,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.640
in hosts on device drivers, and also

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.410
in switches and routers. Let's take an example

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.680
of buffer bloat that we observed in home routers as part of the Bismarck study

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.300
that I described in the last lesson.
