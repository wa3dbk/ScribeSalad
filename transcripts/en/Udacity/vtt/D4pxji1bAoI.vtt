00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.975
So, here is this pesky loop that didn't quite work out for us. We want to keep

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:08.455
asking the user to enter a value less than 100 and we want to keep doing it

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:14.040
while they enter a value greater or equal to 100. But really, what we want to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.864
do is we want to go through the loop once. And then, do the check, and then if

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:23.871
the check fails go through the loop again and so on. The key is we want to go

00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:27.706
through this at least once, the way to do that in Java is to move the while

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:34.350
statement, the while condition to the bottom and to add the word do to the top.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.000
If there were two on the top, the Y condition on the bottom and this is called

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.645
a do loop. Let's look at a program that uses it. So, here's our program. It has

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.906
the do loop that you've just seen. So, we keep asking the user, please enter an

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:54.648
integer, less than 100, until they do. In other words, we stay in the loop

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:58.120
while the input is greater or equal to 100, and then this program doesn't do

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.720
anything with it. It just says thank you for entering a value less than 100.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.864
Let's, let's run this program so you can see it in action. The program has

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:11.107
started, it asks for an integer less than 100. We'll be annoying and put in

00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:15.608
200, we get another prompt and we'll be annoying again. And we could do this

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:22.880
forever, or not. And now, the program simply says thank you for entering 90.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.511
That's the most common reason really to use the do loop for input validation.

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:30.831
And the reason you need the do loop is simply you've got to get at least one

00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:37.326
input from the user before you know whether to complain or not. So, this is the

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:40.771
situation where you've got to enter the loop at least once before you know what

00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:45.569
to do, that's exactly the point of the do loop. The do loop enters the loop at

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.169
least once, whereas the while loop might never enter the loop.
