00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.150
Another runtime security measure that
iOS uses is Data Execution Prevention.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.620
iOS uses the ARM processor's
eXecute Never feature,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.066
which marks memory
pages as nonexecutable.

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.529
More specifically,

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.870
iOS marks pages that are writable
in runtime as nonexecutable.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.630
For example, memory pages that
contain stack will not be executable.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.240
On the flip side, memory pages that are
executable are marked as nonwriteable.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.430
For example, the code pages can be
executable, but they're not writeable.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.860
Data Execution Prevention is
an implementation of the policy

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.820
that makes writeable and
executable mutually exclusive.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.750
If a page is writeable,
meaning that a runtime, new data or

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.367
code can be returned on that memory
page, then this page is not executable.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:58.540
This prevents code-injection
attacks because, to inject code,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.836
the attacker must write
code into a memory page.

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:07.260
But since we make writeable and
executable mutually exclusive, after

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.630
the code can be returned in the memory
page, that page can not be executable.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.550
Therefore, even if the attacker
can write code into memory,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.880
he cannot force execution on that page.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.570
Therefore, he cannot
execute his malicious code.
