00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.250
Now we've talked a bit about how to
share your prototype with people who

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.910
might help you build it better.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.000
One other very common kind of
presentation is a demo of your

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.140
prototype.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.660
These demos come in all shapes and

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.710
sizes, from a 30-second elevator
pitch to a 2-hour presentation.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.250
You'll want to spend some time thinking
about how to best talk about your

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.270
prototype and
show it to various audiences.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.180
These presentations do have some
fundamentals you can start with.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.130
Your elevator pitch can quickly explain
what your app does, who you do it for,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.050
and why it is important.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.800
You've already made an elevator pitch
if you've been through that course.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.900
But it'd be a great idea to take some
time now to refine that elevator pitch.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.520
After all, if you've properly adapted
your app using the marketing course,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.020
it's likely that the who has changed
since you first made that pitch.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.630
And if you've been prototyping well,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.500
it's possible that the what
has changed as well.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.940
Take a moment to revisit
your elevator pitch now, and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.980
check the box when you're done.
