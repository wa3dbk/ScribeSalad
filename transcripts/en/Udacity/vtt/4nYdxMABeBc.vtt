00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:11.019
that the mode occurs here in this bin and same with this bin, which is 40,000 to

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.344
50,000. And that the mean is probably about here at 50,000. And the median is

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:21.839
about in the middle as well, because the distribution is pretty symmetrical for

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:22.307
both.
