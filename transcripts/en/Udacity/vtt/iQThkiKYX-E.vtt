As you know, this is a class about design.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.610
And the question is, how do you get started doing a design? Well,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.300
before you can solve a problem, you need to understand it. And the process for

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.010
understanding a problem is called analysis. In this lesson, we will be concerned

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.600
