00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.005
Now, we've already seen these in practice, but there are some helpful facts

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:07.478
that we can use to solve logarithmic equations. The first is that if a to the x

00:00:07.478 --> 00:00:13.640
equals a to the y, then we know that x must equal y. We saw this earlier in the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.866
problem 3 to the x equals 27. We rewrote 27 as 3 cubed. And since we have 3 to

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:27.355
the x equal to 3 to the y, we can set this exponent equal to this one. The next

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:31.255
fact that can help us solve equations with logarithms is that if a to the x

00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:38.200
equals b to the x, then we know that the base a must equal the base b. We see

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.745
this in a problem like this. X squared equals 5 squared. Well we know since

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:48.628
these are both squares then x must be equal to 5. In order for this amount on

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:53.235
the left, to be equal to this amount on the right. The last fact that we'll use

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:58.593
is that if log of base b of n. Equals log base b of n, then we know that m must

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:03.635
equal n. Since we're taking the log of base b, we know that these two numbers

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:07.417
must be the same in order for the logarithms of those numbers to both be the

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:13.443
same as well. We haven't seen an example like this yet, but we'll use this idea

00:01:13.443 --> 00:01:15.770
in the upcoming problems.
