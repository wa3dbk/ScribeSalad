00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.855
All we need to do is factor the right hand side of the equation. You can leave

00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:10.120
the left hand side exactly the same. Keep that leading coefficient and recognize

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.928
that x squared plus 2x plus 1 is just equal to x plus 1 squared. So if our final

00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:19.141
equation is y plus 13 equals 3 times the quantity x plus 1 squared.
