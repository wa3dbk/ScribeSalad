00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.172
Let's continue writing some equations, but this time, let's try generating

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.351
equations from words instead of a graph. I want you to write the equation above

00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:12.381
line that has a slope of negative 2 and that passes through the point 0 negative

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:16.798
4. Think about what this point is and think about slope-intercept form. I think

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:20.333
you'll be able to figure out. You can write your equation here.
