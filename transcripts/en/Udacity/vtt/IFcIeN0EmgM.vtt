00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.290
Earlier in the course you found out
that there aren't enough addresses to go

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.540
around.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.430
There are actually fewer IPv4 addresses
than there are people in the world, and

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.530
some of us use way
more than one address.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.030
I mean, every sensible person
carries five computers with

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.000
them at all times, right?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.470
The major workaround has been for

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.780
ISPs to assign only one address to each
household, office, or other customer.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.090
And if you had a one computer household,
it would obvious how this would work.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.300
One host, one IP address.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.180
But as people have lots of different
computers and devices in their house

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.990
today, they all have to hide behind
this one IP address and from

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.440
the outside world have to look just like
a single machine with a single address.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.040
Well, how does this work?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010
Let's take the example
of a home network.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.620
Maybe they've got a desktop computer,
and a laptop, and a smart TV, and

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.940
some phones, and all of these talk
to the internet through a router,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.940
which acts as their default gateway.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.769
The router connects to their ISP and
gets a single real public IP address,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.610
and then it assigns private
addresses to all of these devices.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.230
Private IP addresses come off of one
of three reserved IP address netblocks.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.055
The most common private IP addresses
found on home routers are in the network

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:20.060
192.168.0.0/24.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.220
With the default gateway of 192.168.0.1,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.470
this is only one of very many
private IP address possibilities.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.960
If you ever need to look these up,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.870
they're specified in an internet
standard called RFC 1918.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.700
Private IP addresses are used
with a system called NAT or

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.070
network address translation.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.480
The way that it works is that whenever
traffic goes between the private network

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.200
behind the router and the public
internet, the router has to rewrite or

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.980
translate to the network
addresses on it.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.950
The router maintains a map of
which inside addresses and

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.540
ports are connected to what public
internet addresses and ports.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.682
Now most likely your own home or
office network is using NAT, but

00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:06.490
NAT is really a workaround not
a solution to address shortage.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.930
It creates some pretty serious problems.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.930
It makes it much harder,
sometimes impossible,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.140
for end users to run servers
that other people can access.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.440
That makes it hard to write and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.850
debug network applications that
are going to run on end user machines.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.850
The router has to keep track of all
the connections going through it, and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.320
because your computer doesn't
know it's real public address,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.900
applications on it can't easily say
things like forward all my internet

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.710
phone calls to this address without
hacky extra protocol arrangements.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.600
And more moving parts makes
them more error prone.
