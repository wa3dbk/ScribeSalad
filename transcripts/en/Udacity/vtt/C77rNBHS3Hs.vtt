00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.360
Okay so
what were the big ideas of this lesson?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.290
Well one idea is that good algorithms
are work optimal and have low span,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.430
imagine that a DAG is a person where
dependencies go from head to toe.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.550
Now a good algorithm is a person who has
low mass and is short, and really wide,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.210
rather than being say really massive,
super tall and super skinny.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.200
Our related idea is the concept
of weak scalability.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.940
To see if you understand this concept,
here's an exercise.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.250
Go and read about this thing called
Amdahl's Law which you might already

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.130
know about a different udasity course.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.660
Then ask yourself, self, what's the
relationship between Amdahl's Law and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.220
this weak scalability concept?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.190
A second big idea in this lesson is
divide and conquer which you know and

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.389
love from sequential computing and
it's an excellent tool and paradigm for

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.961
thinking about parallel
algorithms as well.

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:01.741
Now in your toolbox of algorithmic
tricks it should often be the first

00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:02.599
thing you try.

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:07.069
The last big idea is to separate how
you express concurrency from how you

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.730
execute it.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.960
Now this is a really neat idea,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.520
which makes it possible to
get truly elegant algorithms.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.290
Unfortunately, this model
also ignores communication,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.630
which it turns out is absolutely
necessary to be vast and scalable.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.180
At least once the problem size and
system size get big enough.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.740
To model communication, you're going to
need some other abstract models.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.140
But for now, let's just see how far
we can take dynamic multi threading.
