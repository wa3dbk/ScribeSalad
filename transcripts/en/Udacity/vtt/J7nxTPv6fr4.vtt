00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:03.166
So here is the connection with differential equations:

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:09.332
The exponential function is the unique solution to the following differential equation:

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:19.466
The derivative of Y of X, with respect to X, equals Y of X, for all X,

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:28.466
and the initial value, Y of zero, equals one. This is about as simple as it can get with differential equations.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:35.399
We're looking for a function, Y, that is its own derivative, and starts with a value of one.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.299
It's clear now that the exponential function is a solution to that differential equation,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.399
but as most other differential equations that are of interest, also this differential equation is so well-behaved

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.433
that the exponential function is the unique solution of this differential equation.
