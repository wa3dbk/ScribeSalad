00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.998
Say, it costs one cycle to read the Z-depth in a pixel in the Z-buffer. One

00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:09.222
cycle to write a new value into the Z-buffer, and one cycle to write a new color

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:13.914
into the image itself. Ignoring all other costs, what is the fastest way to draw

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:18.376
objects? Your four choices are draw objects from front to back, that is closest

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:22.664
to the camera to farthest away, draw objects from the largest to the smallest

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:27.086
object, randomize the draw order to avoid the worst-case behavior, or draw the

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:30.763
objects from back to front, farthest to closest to the camera.
