00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.770
We have just one more step to fully expand this expression. The only change I

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.055
want us to make, is that I'd like us to get rid of this exponent here. Think

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:11.837
about what rule you can apply to make this go away, and then use it to rewrite

00:00:11.837 --> 00:00:16.136
the expression. We're not going to change the last term at all, so I'll just

00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:20.079
write it for you already. What should the first term become?
