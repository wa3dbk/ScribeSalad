00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The mean is simply multiplied by 1.5, and that is 7.5.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
To see what happens with the standard deviation in the variance,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
recall that the standard deviation is defined as the square root of the sum

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of the difference between each observation and the mean.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Since each of these are multiplied by 1.5

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and it's then squared, that means this term below the square root gets bigger

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
by 1.5 squared.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But after we take the square root, it only gets bigger by 1.5

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
since the square root of 1.5 squared is equal to 1.5.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So the standard deviation of the Ys is 6.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Since the variance is the square of the standard deviation, it's 36.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Since Yi is just the individual observation Xi multiplied by 1.5,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
it's 1.5 times 9, which is 13.5.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And the z score or standard score remains at 1.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
To show ourselves this, let's just redo the calculation.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
13.5 is the data point, 7.5 is the mean. Their difference is 6.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The standard deviation is 6. And 6/6 is 1.
