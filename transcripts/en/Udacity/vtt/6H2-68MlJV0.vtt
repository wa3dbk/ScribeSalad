00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.913
When you've declared
your ArrayAdapter of Strings,

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:04.746
it should look something like this.

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:09.340
We pass in the context,
which is this fragment's parent activity,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.420
as well as the ID of the list item layout,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.200
and the ID of the TextView we want to populate.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.610
And lastly, we pass in the forecast data.
