If you put 5 here, great work. You should have multiplied this number by 5 over

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:10.054
5. I know that 5 divided by 5 is still 1. 2 times 5 is 10. 1 times 5 is 5. For

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:14.992
the equivalent fraction over here, you could have put a bunch of different

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:20.239
things. Maybe you put 50 over 100, or 30 over 60, or 13 over 26. Whatever you

00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:26.126
do, just make sure you multiply 1/2 by the same number. Any of these would have

00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:26.643
worked.
