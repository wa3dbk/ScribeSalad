00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.685
And the one that I think is best is the next day procedure. This is sort of the

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:08.432
most important thing to make the solution work. If we can't do this, then we

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:12.104
would need to think of a different approach. And the reason that I think this is

00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:15.947
best is that, we can solve this in a simple way for the simple case, which is

00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:19.916
what we'll do next, not worrying about the complexity of how many days are in

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:23.956
different months. And get a good feeling that we're able to get close to the

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:27.940
right answer for some cases. The other answer that I think would be okay is

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.090
doing is leap year. This is something we know we're going to need at some point.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.201
We need to determine whether the years are leap years to know how many days

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.414
there are in the month of February but it's kind of a grungy, painful thing to

00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:40.454
write. It's something we know we're going to be able to do. And it's something

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:43.682
that's not too interesting, so we're going to leave that until later. You could

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:47.838
certainly make a case for doing that first. The other two are really not good

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:51.350
answers. Trying to do the whole problem at this point is a little early. We

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.500
still want to break it down into simpler parts and make progress and know that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.712
we're making progress. That other one is closer to something very small. The

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:03.616
problem is this is probably not really the procedure that we want and until we

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:07.642
write these other procedures and think more about how we're going to do this, we

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:11.802
might not know enough to implement this correctly. And the reason that I'm going

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:15.393
to suggest that this is not what we want is the number of days in a month

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:19.182
actually depends on the year, if the month is February. So let's start by

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:23.208
writing the next day procedure, and to keep things simple we'll assume that all

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.294
months have 30 days.
