00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.526
Here, a equals negative 3. Amazing work if you found this solution. This

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:08.744
problem is a lot like the ones we've seen before. We want to move this radical

00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:13.616
to the other side of the equal sign. We do that by adding the square root of a

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:18.655
plus 12 to both sides. Next we square both sides of the equation to undo these

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:26.130
square roots. This gives us a linear equation of 2a plus 15 equals a plus 12.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.274
Next, we subtract a from both sides to get a plus 15 equals positive 12. Then

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:38.126
we subtract 15 from both sides to isolate a, so a equals negative 3. Finally,

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:41.774
we check our a value of negative 3 by replacing a in the original equation with

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:47.425
that value. On the left-hand side of our equation, this simplifies to root 9

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:52.947
minus root 9. We know this is 0, or we could say 3 minus 3, which also equals

00:00:52.947 --> 00:00:57.060
0. This means our solution checks so we have our answer.
