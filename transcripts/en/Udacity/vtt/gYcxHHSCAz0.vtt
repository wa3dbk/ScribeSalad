00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose I flip a coin 6 times and get this as an output 100101,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where 1 represents heads and 0 represents tails.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The problem I'm addressing is I'd like to find out what should we think about this coin.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In particular, if someone asks us for this coin what is its probability

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to come up heads, what would you say?
