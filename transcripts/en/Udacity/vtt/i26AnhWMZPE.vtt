00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's a custom component I've been
working on which closely resembles

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.670
a radio group.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.910
To determine what kind of
keyboard support it needs,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.420
I'll check
the Aria Design Patterns guide.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.300
And going to jump down to
Section 11 which lists

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.370
all of the various components and
their patterns.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.830
Once we're down here, I'll look for

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.670
a component that sort of matches
the one that I'm building.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.410
In this case I can see that there's
a radio button right about here.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.090
So I'll click on that.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.830
And based on the recommendations there
are a number of keyboard handlers that I

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.210
know I now need to implement.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.580
Using this guide I'm going to
implement the Down Arrow slash

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.180
Right Arrow support in my element.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.880
Now when the user presses the down arrow
we know that our radio group should move

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.480
focus to the next radio button It should
select that button and it focuses

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.580
is on the last item, then focus
will wrap around to the first item.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.820
To do this, we're going to use
a technique called roving focus.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.880
Roving focus works by
setting tab index to -1 for

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.500
all of the children and
then zero on the currently active item.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570
Our component then uses a keyboard
event listener to determine which

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.130
key the user has pressed.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.960
At which point we set tab index
on the next item to zero,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.570
we set to have a next of the previously
focused item to negative one.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.910
We call the focus method of this
new soon to be focused item,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.190
this now moves our focus ring.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.996
And lastly I'm going to just move this
checked attribute down to this element

00:01:25.996 --> 00:01:30.301
using SET attribute In this case I'm
using the CSS in my element based on

00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:34.284
that checked attribute just style
the state of the radio button.

00:01:34.284 --> 00:01:38.488
Now when I reach the bottom of this
list and this last radio is focused and

00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:43.240
the user presses the down arrow,
then we're going to wrap back around.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.960
So we'll set tab index to
zero on this top item.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.810
We'll move checked over there or
call focus and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.660
we'll set tab index to negative one
on the previously focused item.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.590
For building complex components running
focus is a really invaluable technique.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.830
So in the next lesson, you're going to
take a crack at implementing it yourself

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.210
using the same example.
