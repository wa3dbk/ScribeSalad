00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.030
Now we need to combine these two fractions into a single fraction. The first

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.189
step to that is figuring out the simplest common denominator we can come up with

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.582
for them, then make both fractions have this denominator, and then combine them.

00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:16.300
So I'd like you to do all of this and then enter your new single rational

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.736
expression on the left hand side in this box.
