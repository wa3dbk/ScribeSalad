So what does language allow us to do? You probably came up with a lot of

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:07.304
answers. One thing we can say is that language allows us to function

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:12.945
effectively. We can communicate with others. We can ask for things. We can

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.985
describe things. So, Skinner's approach was a functional approach. Chomsky, we

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:23.312
see, described learning language from a structural approach. But now, let's

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:26.161
turn to Greg for the discussion of Chomsky.
