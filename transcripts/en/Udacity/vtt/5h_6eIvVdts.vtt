00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.250
Let us do an exercise on analogical transfer together. Back to our example of

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.830
this sort of system in the atomic structure. Given this representation of

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.150
the solar system and this representation of the atomic structure,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.309
what would be transferred from the solar system into the atomic structure model?
