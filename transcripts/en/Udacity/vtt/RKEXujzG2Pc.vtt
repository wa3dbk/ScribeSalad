00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.955
So here's overall what we just did. We changed the equation y equals x squared

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:10.243
minus 8x plus 15, an equation for a parabola in standard form. To the equation y

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:15.184
plus 1 equals x minus 4 squared. So now we should be able to really easily where

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:19.824
the vertex of this parabola is. I'd like you to write the coordinates of this

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.213
vertex in these boxes.
