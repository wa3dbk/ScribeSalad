00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.050
All right, cool.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.920
I've got a shopping list name that
anyone in the world can update.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.990
Let's call on some users and
see what the big picture looks like.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.170
Okay, we have three of us using
the version of the app that you

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.220
just created.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.468
When the app starts up,
it attaches a value event listener.

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:16.860
This listener gets triggered
immediately, it takes a snapshot, and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.400
it delivers the snapshot of
Dummy Data to us immediately.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.610
So all of our apps read Dummy Data.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.270
Okay.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.530
Let's say my roommate Kagure changes
the name of the shopping list to

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.830
Kagure's List.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.410
What happens with Firebase?

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.090
It occurs in milliseconds but
it's fairly complex.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.070
Okay, go for it, Kagure.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.740
Once she does this, the app sends the
data to a specific location in Firebase.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.160
Base URL plus listName.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.312
And the value in Firebase
changes to Kagure's List.

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:47.990
Because listName changed, the listeners
triggered, and a snapshot is taken.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.240
Because we were all sitting
at the same location and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.360
it changed, we all get the updated data
in the form of a database snapshot.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.210
Then the onDataChanged has triggered all
of our apps with this data snapshot.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.380
And if you wrote your code correctly,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.120
then everyone's UI display changes
to seamlessly show the updated data.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.620
And the same thing happens no
matter who changes the data.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.150
One person will change it,
and it updates for everyone.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.905
And that's what's so cool about
reading and writing data in Firebase.
