00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.130
We're going to define Fibonacci, so here's

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.360
our definition, and let's try this out, so

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.850
we'll print the result of fibonacci 0, first,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.094
we should get 0, which we do. We'll

00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:19.870
try fibonacci 1, we get 1, so we've seen our two base cases. Now, when

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.598
we do fibonacci 2, what we should get is the result of. Fibonacci 1, which is 1,

00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:30.290
plus Fibonacci 2, minus 2, which is Fibonacci 0, which

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.128
is 0. So we should get 1 again, which we do. And now

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:40.810
let's try printing Fibonacci 3, we get 2.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.690
And if we print Fibonacci 4 we should

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.820
get 1 plus 2, which is 3, which we get. And if we try 5,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.950
we should get 2 plus 3, which is 5. And let's try something a little bigger,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.550
let's try Fibonacci 10. We get 55. We'll try

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.240
Fibonacci 25, so we'll try Fibonacci 24. So for counting months that would be

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.190
the number of rabbits in two years, and we get 46,000. And let's try, in 3

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.230
years. Our program times out. So I'm

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.750
going to try the soon in the Python interpreter,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.180
well see we can do slightly bigger ones.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.330
But, the time it takes to solve Fibonacci,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.210
this way, is very long. And, the reason

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.010
for that is because we're doing lots and lots

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.830
of redundant calculation. So, if we look at

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.620
what our code is doing. Every time, we call

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.960
Fibonacci n, what's happening is we're calling Fibonacci

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.680
n minus 1 and we're calling Fibonacci n minus

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.090
2. So we're starting, we're calling Fibonacci 36,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.520
that was the example, where the interpreter didn't finish.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.250
And, what we'll get is that's going to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.980
be broken down into calling fibonacci 35, plus

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.008
the result that we get from calling fibonacci

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:11.970
34. Each of those is another call to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.180
fibonacci, so the call to fibonacci 35, well

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.080
that will be broken into calling fibonacci 34,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.960
and adding that result to what we get from calling fibonacci 33. And when we do

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.340
fibonacci 34 here. Well, that's going to be turned into,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.590
calling Fibonacci 33, and adding the result to Fibonacci 32.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.570
We're going to do lots, and lots, of calculations here.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.670
And we haven't got close to getting down, to fibo

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.840
1, or fibo 0, which are the only places

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.030
that we stop. If we look at the number of

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.780
times we have to evaluate, fibo 32, let's pick

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.440
that one, so Fibonacci 32. So we need to evaluate,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.130
Fibonacci 32, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, times. The number of times we had to evaluate,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.280
Fibonacci 33, was 1, 2, 3, times The

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.875
number of times we had to evaluate Fibonacci

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:10.860
34 was 2 times, and the number of times we had to evaluate fibonacci 35,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.340
was 1 time, and the number of times we had to evaluate fibonacci 36 was 1 time.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.250
So, maybe you can see a pattern here. How many times

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.203
do you think we're going to need to evaluate fibonacci 31?
