00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.050
Vendors have come up with a variety of strategies for

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.540
dealing with component versioning issues.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.880
At a minimum, version numbers are used.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.180
When deployment is performed the version number is used to

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.200
perform a compatibility check.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.370
Other strategies that vendors have taken include the following.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.010
Some vendors have ad hoc compatibility rules.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.000
That is the rules pertain to the particular version and change between versions.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.190
Some vendors claim that they have immutable interfaces,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.190
that is the vendor promises never to change the interface.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.380
Some vendors guarantee backward compatibility.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.590
Changes can be made but old versions are guaranteed to continue working.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.270
Some vendors have sliding windows of supported versions.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.480
That is, they will, support the previous five versions or

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.320
the previous three versions.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.500
Some vendors take a middle ground saying they're going to break compatibility

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.370
only with major releases that include major new features.
