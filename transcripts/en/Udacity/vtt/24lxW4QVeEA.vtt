00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.980
Here it's probably Lauren that handled the

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.750
situation better, as she said, there's nothing we

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.160
can do about the changing of the tides, and Greg might lose some sleep if he

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.630
tries to solve this in a problem focused

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.150
way. It's highly unlikely that he's going to

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.830
be able to change the tides, so again, poor Greg, he can't cope with the tides.
