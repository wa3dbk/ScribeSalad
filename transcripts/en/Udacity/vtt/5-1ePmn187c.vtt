00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Because the nodes are filled in the tree from top to bottom and left to right,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we can number them very naturally as follows.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We'll call this node 0, node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, and so on.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Because of the regularity with the way that the nodes are numbered,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the fact that there's always two children until you get down to the bottom

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and it kind of trails off.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's all sorts of relationships that you can figure out between nodes and their parents.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We don't have to explicitly store them we can keep it implicitly

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
because it can be implicit in the numbering scheme.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I want you to stare at this for a little while and see if you can figure out the numbering scheme.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Imagine we have a much bigger tree with, say, 500 nodes. Somewhere in that tree there is node 72.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What would the right child of node 72 be using this numbering scheme?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I want you to figure out the answer and write it in this box.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But mostly, I want you to figure out the general rule and just apply that rule in the case of 72.
