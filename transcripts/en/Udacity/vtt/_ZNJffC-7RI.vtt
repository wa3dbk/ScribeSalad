00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.960
Let's take some time to look at
a blogging app we've designed,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.420
as well as some feedback on it.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.510
In order to look at which
bits of feedback are useful.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.780
So, here is the app.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.770
What we're trying to figure out is
whether this app design works as

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.430
a blogging platform.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.780
Can users easily find blogs they want,
and post their content easily?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.380
When we asked users to
find a particular blog, or

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.410
to post their own content,
they were generally confused.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.400
Users had a lot of things
to say about this design.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.210
I find this really overwhelming,
and I'm not sure where to go.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.790
I really like the title.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.590
You should use Comic Sans for the font.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.810
I can't find a way to post here.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.150
Which icon is the blog I need?

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.190
Remember, valuable feedback is
any feedback that ties a feeling

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.240
from the user to a specific
part of the app.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.390
Now, which of these bits of
feedback are useful for us?
