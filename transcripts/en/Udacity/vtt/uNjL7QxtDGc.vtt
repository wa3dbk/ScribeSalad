00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.200
These views are called State Transition Diagrams, they're essentially represent,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.160
graphical representations of a Finite State Machines.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.780
In these diagrams we have an indication of a node, typically with an oval,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.410
or some kind of rectangle. We have arcs, directed arcs connecting the nodes,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.510
indicating that there's a state transition. The arcs can be labeled.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.140
The arcs can be labeled with an action and a transition.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.660
Typically the actions can be can be optional. Usually,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.990
but not always, the transitions are, are not optional, okay? If you recall

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.940
your finite state machines from theory, there are these epsilon transitions.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.820
We'll see in fact that the garage door opener has one of these, but they're,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.550
they're not, they're not all that typical. Note that the layout of the nodes,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.370
where we placed them in the diagram, doesn't have any semantic import. So

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.710
you are free to make the diagram lay it out in a way that conveys what you

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.780
consider to be the important behavioral aspects of the system. In terms of

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.070
how these diagrams work, you can think of yourself as, at any point in time,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.550
being in a specific state. Okay, kind of waiting there until an event happens.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.910
When the event happens, the outgoing arcs are examined to determine

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.340
whether any of them are labeled with the corresponding event.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.670
And if so, a transition is made between the current state and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.010
the state at the end of that transition. And in so

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.690
doing the action, if any, on that transition arc is, is executed.
