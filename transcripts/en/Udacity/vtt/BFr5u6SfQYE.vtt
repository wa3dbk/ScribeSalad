00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.440
The right answer is log n to the base two

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.140
ceiling of log n to the base two and of

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.080
course, from the example that we just saw, with n

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.210
equal to five. We saw that at the end of

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.110
three rounds, everybody has gotten a message from every other

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.382
node in the entire system. And therefore it is common

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:21.970
knowledge at that point that that has been reached. So

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.320
the right answer is ceiling of log n To the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.750
base two, and if you chose log N to the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.740
base two, you're not far off from the right answer but,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.560
you know, the reason why it is ceiling is because of

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.990
the fact that N need not be a power of two.
