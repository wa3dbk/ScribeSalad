Now, this is great for JSON, but what if we want to grab something else, say,

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:10.118
a sound file. To do that, we need to set the response type of the XMLHttp

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.732
request object to arraybuffer and what that will do is specify that it is binary

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:21.321
information rather than text that we can then decode as necessary. What we like

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:26.357
you to do is create another XMLHttp request but this time we're going to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.612
request "bg_menu.ogg", a sound file and set the response type

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:36.645
to arraybuffer. Now, we've already created the on load function for you to use. Don't worry if

00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:41.725
you don't understand any of this. We'll be going over this in more detail later

00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:46.279
in the sound unit. For right now, your job is just to fire off the XMLHttp

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:46.808
request.
