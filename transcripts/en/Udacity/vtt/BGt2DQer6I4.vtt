00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.840
In this lesson, you've seen
the basics of two SQL statements.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.240
Select for fetching data from
the database, and insert for

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.070
adding data to the database.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.300
You've also applied joins in
aggregations to answer a variety of

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.470
questions.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.010
In the next lesson,
we'll talk about creating tables and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.690
declaring the relations and
data types within them, so

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.000
you can build your own
tables from scratch.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.080
You'll also learn how to extend your
analysis by connecting your database

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.210
powers to your Python
programming skills.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.730
See you there.
