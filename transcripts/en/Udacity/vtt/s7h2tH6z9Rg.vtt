00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.970
The last feature of this visualization I want to cover is animation.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.310
Animation isn't technically a visual encoding, but

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.550
you can think of it as encoding some information, or rather,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.790
change of information in a certain sort of way.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.450
As we can see here,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.360
the animation really highlights how drastically different the Facebook IPO

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.580
was in value compared to the history of IPOs that came before it.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.729
Not only does the animation convey some of the process the RS went through

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.370
in creating this visualization, such as discovering that the Facebook IPO was so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.630
drastically greater than all the other IPOs.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.380
Or the fact that using different scaling, in this case logarithmic,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.450
makes the graphic much more interpretable, but also gets across

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.240
some of the relative change of the companies in the years after they've IPOed.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.435
While you might be able to encode this sort of information, such as how much

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:07.560
a company's value has changed after its IPO, in another dimension of visual

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.310
encoding, let's say the z axis, it is much easier, and I think

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.580
much more effective, to communicate that information through the animation.
