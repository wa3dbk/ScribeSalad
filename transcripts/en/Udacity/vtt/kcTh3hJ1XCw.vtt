00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.512
Now that you know how to statistically decide, whether a sample is different

00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:08.330
from a population parameter, the rest of this lesson will be easy. We're going

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.269
to use these same concepts to compare two samples that are dependent. They're

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.720
dependent when the same subject takes the test twice. This is a Within subject

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.540
design. One example, is when each subject, is assigned two conditions in random

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.335
order. For example, they're in the control condition, and then they get a

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:33.448
treatment. Or maybe there are two kinds of treatments that they're trying to

00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:37.806
test. Another example is if every subject is given a pretest, and then a

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:42.460
post-test. And another example is growth over time, otherwise, known as a

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.298
longitudinal study. And then we'll measure the variable for each subject at one

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:52.375
point in time, and then again at another point in time. When we have these

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:57.108
within subject designs, we have paired data. This column of xi's would

00:00:57.108 --> 00:01:02.916
correspond to the variable measurements of one condition or of the pretest, or

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:09.155
of some point in time. And then the y values would correspond to a second

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:14.850
treatment, or a post-test, or a measurement at another point in time. And then,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.968
what we want to do is look at the difference between these values. We'll call

00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:25.632
this D sub i. And that's just the x values minus the y values. Or it could be

00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:30.500
the opposite. We're really just concerned with the absolute difference. Now, we

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.210
follow the same procedure as we did before with the one sample t-test, except

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.833
we used the values of D.
