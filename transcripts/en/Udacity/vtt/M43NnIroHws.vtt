00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.775
So now let's calculate the deviation from mean by subtracting the mean from

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:14.890
each of these values. So, the first one here would be 33,219 minus $52,793.80.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.095
Just to practice, enter a few deviations from the mean. Remember, some of these

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:20.430
might be negative.
