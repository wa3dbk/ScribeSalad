00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So what's the running time of this going to be?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Is it (logn) like the other heap operations we've been looking at?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Is it θ(n)?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Is it θ(nlogn),

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which I had said most sorting can be done in (nlogn),

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but it's not clear if this actually achieves that.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Or is it more like (n₂)?
