00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.830
So in this lesson, we'll look at an important question

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.230
in switch design which is how much buffering do routers

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.440
and switches need? It's fairly well known that routers and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.790
switches do need packet buffers to accommodate for statistical multiplexing.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.390
But it's less clear how much packet buffering is really

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.330
necessary. Now given that queuing delay is really the only

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.900
variable part of packet delay on the internet, you'd think

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.630
we'd know the answer to this question already. And for

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.880
quite some time there have been some well understood rules

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.140
of thumb but it turns out that we've recently revisited

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.760
this question and come up with some different answers. So

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.940
let's first look at the universally applied rule of thumb. Now

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.595
for the sake of the examples in this lesson, I'm

00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:42.980
going to use routers and switches

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.250
interchangeably because it doesn't really matter.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.110
All that matters here is that we have a network

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.670
device that's a store and forward packet device. That, has the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.010
capability of storing a frame or a packet and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.560
then later sending it on. So let's suppose that we

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.220
have a path between a source and a destination,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.650
and the round-trip propagation delay is 2T and the capacity

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.180
to bottleneck link is C. Now the commonly held

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.700
view is that this router needs a buffer of 2T

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.170
times C. It should be clear why this rule

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.880
of thumb exists. C is the capacity to the bottleneck

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.310
link in say, bits per second and T is the time of units second, so this works

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.270
out to bits, and the meaning of this quantity is simply the number of bits that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
could be outstanding along this path at any

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.440
given time. It effectively represents the maximum amount

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.560
of outstanding data that could be on this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.950
path between the source and destination at any time.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.710
Now this rule of thumb guideline was mandated

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.620
in many backbone and edge routers for many years.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.070
It appears in RFCs and ITF Architectural guidelines and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.940
it has major consequences for router design. Simply because

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.000
this can be a lot of router memory and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.890
memory can be expensive. The other thing of course

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.440
is that the bigger these buffers, not only the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.190
bigger the cost but also the bigger the queuing

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.288
delay that could exist at any given router. And

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:12.540
hence, the more delay the interactive traffic may experience

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.000
and the more delay that feedback about congestion will

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
experience. The longer these delays are, the longer it

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.800
will take for the source to hear about congestion

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.270
that might exist in the network. Now to understand

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.680
why this guideline is incorrect, let's first re-derive the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.300
rule of thumb a bit more formally and then we'll

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.940
understand why it does not always apply in practice.
