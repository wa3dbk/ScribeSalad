00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.450
Great.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:02.770
Now that you have the context for

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.230
what makes up a LinkedIn profile,
it's time to start building.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.060
The first step of building is
establishing a strategic mindset.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.440
You should keep these
three goals in mind.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.400
Goal number one, show up in
search with the right keywords.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.844
Keywords matter because it is one of the
primary ways recruiters find LinkedIn

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:21.527
profiles.

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:24.645
Goal number two, Once your profile
is found, make sure it stands out.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:27.834
There are a lot of profiles in LinkedIn,
so

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:32.719
you want yours to not only be
searchable, but also be memorable.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.125
Goal number three, signal that you
are qualified and motivated for

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:38.390
your desired job.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.642
You want to make a good
first impression.

00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:43.609
Next, try to personalize
these big picture goals so

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.325
you can understand what to be
included in your LinkedIn profile.

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:51.780
To help you with this, conduct
an exercise I like to call the three Rs.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.270
The three Rs are Reflect,
Research, and Relate.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.900
Now, it's your turn to
get the three Rs a try.
