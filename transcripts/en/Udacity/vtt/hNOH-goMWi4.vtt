00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now Alice is going to send a message to Bob that will allow Bob to learn the wire label.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The way she's going to do that is actually quite simple,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
she's just going to add these two keys to the wire labels.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
She'll send these two values to Bob.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Another question is how does Bob compute W1, and we assume Bob's input value was 1.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We pick X1 here and follow the protocol as specified.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Does Bob now have enough information to figure out W1? These are the choices.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is it possible for Bob to now learn the value corresponding to Bob's input wire?
