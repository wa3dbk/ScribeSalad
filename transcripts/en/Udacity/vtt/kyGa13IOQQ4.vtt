00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.090
Let's assume for now that the running time of this algorithm is 2n+a+1,

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.650
so even for this simple algorithm, the running time depends on both the size of the inputs

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.260
to the length of the string and the structure of the input, which in this case

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.540
is the number of times the letter a occurs.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.240
And this is of course very problematic because on the one hand when we get

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.130
more complicated algorithms, the formula here will get very, very complicated.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.980
And the second thing is that most of the time we don't even know what kinds of strings

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.680
the algorithm will encounter, so we cannot get rid of this variable without making any assumptions.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.260
We want to avoid these complications and there's actually

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.120
three different ways you could do that.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.970
The first one would be to have a very optimistic view and state the running time

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.940
for the best possible input that this algorithm could receive.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.160
Basically saying this is the minimum running time of the algorithm

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.670
and state that as its overall running time.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.620
You could, of course, also take the opposite view and say--we're going to state the running time

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.450
as a worst-case view, so we're going to be very pessimistic almost like there was an adversary

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.630
who is giving us the worst possible inputs and then state that as the running time.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.780
And then finally we can take an in between view and say--well, the usual input for the algorithm

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.050
is not going to be your best case.

00:01:31.050 --> 99:59:59.000
It's also not going to be the worst case, so let's state some kind of average.
