00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.064
We'll now put together everything that you've learned in this lesson, to solve

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:08.410
an important problem, how to validate the input that a human user provided.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.570
Think again about the program with which we started this lesson, the elevator

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.892
simulator. The user enters a number between one and 18, but not 13. There is no

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:23.975
button labeled 13. And then that program computed the actual floor. Never mind

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:27.880
that part. What I want to talk about is the part where we read the user input.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.400
In a program we don't have buttons. But we ask the user to type in the input.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.932
There's a prompt. And then what if some crazy user now enters 19 in the hope of

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:42.362
getting to the roof or something. Or minus 2. Or some text, users do all sorts

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:47.292
of interesting things. And when they do, the program might misbehave. So it's a

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:50.708
better idea to catch those first, and just tell the user that, that was not

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:54.903
right. Let's list the things that can go wrong and how one can address them in

00:00:54.903 --> 00:01:01.346
Java. First off, there's no button 13. And so in Java, you might write, if the

00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:07.505
floor equals 13, then print an error for the user. Let's continue. The next

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:11.841
rule is that the bottom floor is one, and the top floor is 18. So if the user

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:17.076
enters a number that is less than one, or greater than 18. We want to reject

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:21.560
that. Here is the Java code. Note the use of the or operator here. If the floor

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.594
is less than one, or greater than 18, then we print this error message. And

00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:30.309
finally, there is the issue. What if the user doesn't even type any number, but

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:34.816
some words? That would actually be bad. Because, then, the nextInt method would

00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:39.504
fail. Let me show you how to protect against that. There is another method that

00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:43.032
we haven't yet seen, called hasNextInt, which looks at the user input, and,

00:01:43.032 --> 00:01:46.560
instead of, doing what the nextInt method does, namely returning it It just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.584
checks whether it is an integer or not. It returns true, if the user entered an

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:58.351
integer. It returns false, if the user entered something else. In other words,

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.540
it's a method that returns a Boolean value. So we can test for that, in the if

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.215
statement. If the method returns true, then it is safe to call nextInt. We can

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:12.334
read the input, and then process it in any way we want. If on the other hand

00:02:12.334 --> 00:02:16.470
this method returns false, then we print an error message. Now, it's your turn.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.565
Put those three pieces together, and fix up the elevator demo so that any bad

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:24.660
input from the user is caught and the program only proceeds when the user did

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.870
the right thing. An integer between 1 and 18, but not 13.
