00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.630
As you might recall from early on,

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.280
one of the things our design calls for
is scrolling of the app bar.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.210
And to do this scrolling, we're going to
make use of a brand new support library

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.520
we've created to help
with material design.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.220
The design library.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.090
This library contains tons of stuff to
help you implement material patterns.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.900
It supports all sorts of app bar
buttons, including collapsing

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.510
toolbars with floating action buttons,
collapsing toolbars with pinning,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.180
app bar scrolling with pinned list,
parallax scrolling with underscroll,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.070
parallax scrolling with
collapsing app bars.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.040
And it's a lot more than
just app bar pattern,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.580
it also supports things
like navigation views.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.520
Snackbars and floating action buttons,
tab layouts with fixed and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.220
scrolling tabs, and material text
input with collapsing hint texts.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.450
These tools and more open up
the palette for Android developers to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.930
easily implement more material design
And to do so in consistent ways.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.970
The key to how most of this
functionality is implemented

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.275
is the CoordinatorLayout.

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:16.250
CoordinatorLayout is part
of the design library,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.490
its basic functionality is
similar to frame layout.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.960
Any views that are placed in
a CoordinatorLayout overlap by default.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.848
You can use layout gravity to
align the views within the layout.

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:32.520
Similar to relative layout, views can
be positioned based upon sibling views,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.530
except in a more limited way.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.690
Gravity can be applied, position of
view center, up, down, left, or right,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.600
with regards to the parent view.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.811
Most interestingly,

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:46.790
CoordinatorLayout supports behavior
classes that can alter the layout.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.480
When we use a snack bar, and
we have a floating action button

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.590
inside of a CoordinatorLayout,
the default behavior for

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.545
a floating action button will check
to see if there are any overlapping

00:01:55.545 --> 00:02:00.235
snack bars and automatically move the
floating action button out of the way.

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:03.050
AppBarLayout is a special
kind of linear layout that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.960
works with CoordinatorLayout to animate
various kinds of toolbar patterns

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.380
during nested scrolling
with a sibling view.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.980
Each child of AppBarLayout
takes layout scroll flags,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.560
defined the behavior when nested
scrolling is taking place.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
And the sibling to the AppBar is given
the AppBar scrolling view behavior

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.320
to coordinate with the AppBar.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.000
So, this is how our AppBar will scroll
of the screen when we scroll our

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.640
recycler view.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.620
We add the CollapsingToolbarLayout
to the mix for

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.430
some of those really fancy animations.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.400
It allows you some really
complicated transitions.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.380
And the best thing is, you can create
all this complex behavior in XML layouts

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.680
without having to touch the code.
