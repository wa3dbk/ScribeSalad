00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.412
So let's summarize our breadth first search try number 1.

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:05.710
So this algorithm has some great properties.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.277
It's completely parallel, and there's no direct communication or synchronization between threads at all.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.198
There's very little thread divergence.

00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:16.412
The memory behavior isn't ideal since it involves gathers and scatters, but it's not bad.

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:20.023
Unfortunately, the host has to control the iterations, which isn't super attractive,

00:00:20.023 --> 00:00:24.401
though we'll look at a new feature in CUDA 5 in the next unit called Dynamic Parallelism

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.696
that allows the GPU to control the iterations directly,

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:29.405
but the real problem is the quadratic complexity.

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:31.867
We're going to have perfectly data parallel work,

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:34.152
but we're going to do way too much of it.

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:37.240
This approach will scale poorly as we process larger and larger graphs,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.223
and we are not cool with that at all.
