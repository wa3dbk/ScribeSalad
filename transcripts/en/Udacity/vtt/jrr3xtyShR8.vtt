00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.740
Now let's look at the client side. Look

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.780
at the ease with which any arbitrary client on

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.860
the network can access the server object. What

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.680
a client will do is, look up the service

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.100
provider, by contacting a boot strap name server

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.232
in the Java RMI system. And, it does a

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:25.510
look up of the URL and when it does this look up, so this URL is published,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.480
once it is published, then it can look up this URL. And when it does this look

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.520
up of this URL using the facility that's available

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.750
in the Java RMI system, then a local access

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.910
point for that object is created on the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.530
client side. And so now we've got the access

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.970
to the object that is at the server through

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.060
this local name account. And once I have that,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.460
then I can do invocations on the methods that

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.000
is available in this server object by simply calling those

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.410
methods. I can do a deposit. I can do

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.750
a withdrawal. I can do a balance check. All of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.400
this, they look like normal procedure calls so far

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.130
as the client is concerned. But each of this is

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.910
really a call that is going out to the server

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.390
wherever that server happens to be, and the Java Runtime

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.290
system knows how to locate that server in

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.810
order to do this invocation. That's the power of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.470
the Java RMI. The client does not know

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.740
and does not care the location of the server.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.890
And if there a failures in any of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.770
these function executions, then remote exceptions will be thrown

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.810
by the server through the Java run-time system

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.050
back to the client. Of course with the networked

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.110
nature of this client/server relationship, if a remote expression

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.115
is thrown and the client sees that the invocation

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:52.970
did not succeed, which is a reason the client

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.460
saw an exception thrown. It may have no way

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.540
of knowing at what point in the invocation the

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.390
call actually failed. And this is one of the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.940
problems when you have services that you have to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.230
reach across the network and you have to handle

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.310
the exception.
