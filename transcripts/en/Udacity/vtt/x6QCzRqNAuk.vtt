00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.934
I won't formally prove it here. But the same mirroring matrix can be used to

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:08.154
transform both points and normals. The mathematical explanation is that the

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.402
mirroring matrix is like a uniform scaling matrix. However, since no scaling is

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:16.268
actually occurring, we don't need to renormalize the normal. Therefore, this

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:20.317
fourth answer is correct. Intuitively, if you think of going through the looking

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:25.230
glass. Your left and right hand change position, and your body flips, and so on,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.325
but your shape and size remain the same, so you don't have to mess around with

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:30.213
your normals.
