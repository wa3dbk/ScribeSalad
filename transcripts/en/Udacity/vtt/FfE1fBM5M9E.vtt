00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.546
This Hyperbolas is centered at three negative 2, has an a value of two and a b

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:11.493
value of 3. Great thinking if you got all three correct. We know the center is

00:00:11.493 --> 00:00:16.384
at three negative two, since we have the opposite sign in the parenthesis. So

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:21.010
this is our h and this is our k. H will be positive 3, the opposite sign of

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.766
negative 3, and k will be negative 2, the opposite sign of positive 2. This is

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:32.723
our center for our hyperbola. Finding a and b are the same as just before. We

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:38.020
just take the square root of this to get a, and the square of this to get b.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.284
Now we're ready to graph our hyperbola. We start by graphing an ellipse with a

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:47.645
center of positive 3 and negative 2. So, positive 3 on the x, negative 2 on the

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:53.052
y, here's our new center. We go two units in the x direction and three units in

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:58.692
the y direction to get the remaining points. But we're not really graphing an

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:04.040
ellipse, we're graphing a hyperbola. So we draw a dashed rectangle around our

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.160
ellipse and then we draw in the 2 diagonals. We know our hyperbola is going to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.860
open to the left and to the right, since the x squared term is positive. So we

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.010
split our ellipse in half, and then we pivot the two sides outward and extend

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.200
them to the diagonals. This gives us our hyperbola.
