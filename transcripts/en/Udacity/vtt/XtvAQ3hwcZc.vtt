00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.960
You should have changed the TextView
into a ListView element.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.180
Then you can remove this text attribute
because you don't need it anymore.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.790
Now from the UX Mocks, you'll remember
that the list takes up the whole screen,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.480
so we want to set the width and height
to be match_parent.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.378
That will make the ListView
match the dimensions of its parent,

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:20.316
which is this RelativeLayout.

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:22.875
And to find out the parent
of this RelativeLayout,

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:25.526
it's actually in this activity_main XML file

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:29.477
because the fragment
is contained within the activity.

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:34.560
Within this file, we see that this view
is also match_parent for height and width.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.440
So now we can confirm that the ListView
actually will take up the full screen.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.626
Going back to the fragment_main file,
we can add the id,

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:45.270
listview_forecast, onto the ListView.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.085
And then, since this layout
only contains one child,

00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:52.093
we can simplify the layout
by changing this into a FrameLayout.
