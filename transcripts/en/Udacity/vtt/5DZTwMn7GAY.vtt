00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.377
Now, what's the probability, for example, of randomly selecting a subject that

00:00:06.377 --> 00:00:12.750
is greater than five standard deviations above the mean? Would the probability

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.746
be approximately 0.01? And notice that these are in proportions 0.3, 0.8, or

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:19.249
0.99.
