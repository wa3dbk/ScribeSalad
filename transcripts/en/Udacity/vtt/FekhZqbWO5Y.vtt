00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this case--this wasn't intended to be a super hard question--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
as n grows there seems to be a linear relationship.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Doubling n seems to double the time.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That was the answer that I was looking for.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Of course, it makes a lot of sense when you think about what naive is actually doing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's switch back to naive for a moment and look to see what it's doing.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It takes whatever value is passed in as a, and it runs a loop.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The number of times that it goes through this loop is exactly equal to a.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If you double a, it's going to double the number of times it goes through this loop

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and double the overall time.
