00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
Stratton and colleagues call their final technique regularization,

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.082
and regularization is all about load balancing.

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:11.082
Load balancing is a problem that's plagued parallel programming since its inception.

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:14.650
Now to illustrate the idea of load imbalance,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.572
let's go back to our example for technique 5 where we were binning the cities of the United States.

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:22.858
If you look at this map you'll notice that the cities aren't spread out evenly.

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:25.605
Some grid cells are going to have a lot of cities,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:27.936
like up in this region,

00:00:27.936 --> 00:00:30.192
and some grid cells are going to have relatively few cities.

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:36.242
So any threads that are adding up the city population to nearby cities in these cells--

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:38.342
they've got a lot of work to do, right?

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:42.938
They've got lots of cities to look at in the neighboring cells

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:46.181
so that they can look at those cities and compute distances.

00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:51.198
So any threads that are adding up the city population and cells up here have a lot of work to do.

00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:53.212
They've got a lot of cities to compare to,

00:00:53.212 --> 00:00:57.246
while other threads that are in the same warp or the same block

00:00:57.246 --> 00:01:01.688
might be responsible for a city in 1 of these grid cells

00:01:01.688 --> 00:01:03.858
and have a lot less work to do,

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:07.176
and so it will complete quickly and sit around waiting for these long running threads.

00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:10.860
This is an example--a classic example of load imbalance.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.001
So regularization is all about reorganizing the input data to reduce load imbalance.

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.406
In other words you're taking irregular parallelism and turning it into regular parallelism.

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:25.688
For example, in the US cities' example we've been looking at

00:01:25.688 --> 00:01:28.947
some bins might contain more cities than the average bin,

00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:33.283
so you can imagine provisioning each bin to have a fixed number of cities, say 5,

00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:37.157
and then have a special way of handling those relatively few overflow cities.

00:01:37.157 --> 00:01:41.296
For example, you might handle the cities or grid cells that overflow on the CPU,

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:44.229
or you might use a different kernel that implements a different algorithm

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.662
such as sorting the cities by longitude or latitude.

00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:50.142
There are many ways you could do this computation that we were trying to do

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:54.480
with figuring out which cities were within 50 or 300 kilometers of each other.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.779
And now the storage in the main kernel code get's a lot simpler, right?

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:01.330
Every bin has 5 slots; each thread loops over exactly 5 cities.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.328
And the fact that you'll occasionally waste a bit of compute while 1 thread sits idle for a slot,

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:08.107
because it only had 3 cities or 4 cities in its bin

00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:10.273
is more than made up for by the fact

00:02:10.273 --> 00:02:13.767
that you never have an entire warp or an entire thread block or an entire kernel

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:18.741
waiting on a single thread that has 127 cities to check or 1,000 cities to check.

00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:21.573
You've regularized the problem.
