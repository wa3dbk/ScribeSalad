00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.828
Now let's implement the method which returns the plural form of a word. We'll

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:07.115
make some simplifying assumptions because plurals in English has a lot of

00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:10.816
rules. Check out the Wikipedia article if you don't believe me, or if you think

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:14.986
phoenetics are interesting. We're just going to look at regular plurals, like

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:21.105
dish, which becomes dishes. Or cherry, which becomes cherries. Or clock, which

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:24.382
becomes clocks. Here are the rules I want you to implement for the initial

00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:27.382
version. If you want to make a more comprehensive version, nothing's stopping

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:31.638
you, but get these ones down first. If the word ends in y, preceded by a

00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:39.810
consonant, take away the y an add ies, like in cherries. If the word ends in y

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.046
preceded by a vowel, just add s, like in day which becomes days. If the word

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:56.278
ends in o, s, sh, or ch, add es, likes in dishes. Otherwise, just add an s. You

00:00:56.278 --> 00:00:59.222
can use the is vowel and is consonant methods that you wrote before, as well as

00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:04.870
another method that I added. The method is takes an index, and the letter to

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.800
compare it to, and returns true if the letter at that index matches the letter.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.080
There's also a tester program with a bunch of examples of correct plural

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.879
spellings of the words. As a bonus, what happens if you give your program a

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:25.180
single letter word, like a. What if you give it an empty string? Does it crash?
