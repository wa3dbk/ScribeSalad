00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.370
Here, the hypotenuse is 30 inches. Great work if you found this number. We'll

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.390
start with a right triangle, with side lengths 18 inches and 24 inches. We'll

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.360
use x for the length of the hypotenuse since that's what we're finding. Now we

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.560
just plug into the Pythagorean theorem, squaring the legs, and squaring our

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.880
unknown hypotenuse length. When we square 18, we get 324. And when we square

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.379
24, we get 576. The sum of these equals 900. And no we can take the square root

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.841
of both sides to solve for x. Here, we'll keep the positive root only, since

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:41.300
we're talking about distance. The length that this hypotenuse is 30 inches.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.080
This triangle is actually a special right triangle with side lengths in the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.350
ratio of 3 to 4 to 5. So, we can actually use this to help us solve for x

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.898
without using the Pythagorean Theorem. If we multiply 3 by 6, we'll get 18. And

00:00:55.898 --> 00:01:01.478
if we multiple 4 by 6 we'll get 24. This means to find this unknown hypotneuse

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:08.180
we multiple the hypotneuse by 5 by our same multipler 6. We multiple 5 times 6

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.214
we'll get 30. Now not every right triangle will be so special. In this case it

00:01:15.214 --> 00:01:21.124
was since these side lengths were in the ratio of 3 to 4 to 5. This is why we

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:24.720
looked at those Pythagorean triples earlier. Sometimes they can help us problem

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.674
solve more quickly. But either way we solve we'll still get a hypotenuse of 30.
