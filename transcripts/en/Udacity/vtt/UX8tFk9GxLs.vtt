00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.750
Elevator floor buttons and coffee mug handles are both affordances and

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.440
signifiers, because they both signal that an

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.210
interaction can happen, and their physical characteristics allow

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.360
the interaction to take place. Also, traffic lights are indeed signifiers.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.966
The lights themselves don't permit an interaction between an object and an

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.787
agent. But, by cultural convention, they

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:37.639
do signify that certain actions should and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:42.280
can take place. The incorrect statement here is statement C.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.230
The word pull on a door does not permit action between an object and an actor,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.450
and so it's not an affordance. The sign does, however, signify

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.320
that the door should be operated. We'll talk more about signifiers next.
