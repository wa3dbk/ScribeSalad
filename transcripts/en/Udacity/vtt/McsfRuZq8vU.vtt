00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.970
So where is finger retrieving all of
this information such as our user name,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.240
our home directories, the shell?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.650
Much of this information is found
within a file that stores information

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.010
about each user.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.290
This file is called etc/passwd.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.670
Let's take a look at that
file using the cat command.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.150
Each line within this file is
an entry for a single user, and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.390
each entry has a number of fields that
are separated by colon characters.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.930
Let's find the entry for
our current user, vagrant.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.982
The line looks like this,

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:36.920
vagrant:x:1000:1000:
:/home/vagrant:/bin/bash.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.240
These two numbers 1000:1000 might
be different on your system, but

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.840
that's okay.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.630
It's nothing to worry about.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.910
The first field reads vagrant and
that's this users username.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.520
The second field used to
store encrypted passwords.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.320
Historically storing encrypted
passwords in this file wasn't an issue

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.140
as the hardware was too slow to
crack a well chosen password.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.170
These days, almost every distribution
will just insert a character that is

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.350
ignored in this field.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.220
In this case, ubuntu uses an x.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.500
The third and fourth field store
your user ID and group ID.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.130
We'll discuss these a bit more when we
get into talking about file permissions.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.710
There's a fifth field here that may be
hard to see since it doesn't include

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.870
any text.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.030
It's empty.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.970
This field is used to store a better
description about this user.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.900
You can see one user does have
a better description here.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.380
Gnat's and then this full description,
gnats bug reporting system admin.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.020
The last two fields are the user's
home directory and finally,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870
the user's default shell.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.740
Our home directory is
/home/vagrant as we already knew.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.294
And our default shell is bin/bash.
