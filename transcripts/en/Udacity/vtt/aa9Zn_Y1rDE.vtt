00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, the answer we're looking for is: 8.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We just multiply the (3 * 4) first--that's a 12.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the 8 over 2--that's a 4; we do that first.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have to do both of those things

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
before we can do the Subtraction

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because they have higher precedence.

00:00:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So we end up with: (12 - 4) is 8.
