00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.966
Now, the final part is when we have a character followed by a star or a question mark.

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:10.132
That's a little more complicated. I won't ask you to do that yourself. I'll show you.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:15.966
Let me walk you through this. First thing we're going to do is we're going to break up the pattern into three pieces.

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:26.632
The pattern was something like "A*!" And so the first part is P, which is a single character that comes before the star.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:30.699
The second part is the operator, which is either a star or a question mark,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.966
and the third part is the rest of the pattern: Everything else after the star or the question mark.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:42.332
Now, there's two cases. If the operator is a star, we're going to just give up and call another function here.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:47.866
And we're going to have to write that function. But rather than do it inline, we'll call it,

00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:51.366
which we'll need because it's going to end up being a recursive function.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:59.499
So we'll match star, which says, "Match P any number of times followed by pattern against the text."

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.232
If the operator is a question mark, then if we can match the first character, P, against the text,

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:13.899
and match the rest of the pattern after the question mark against the rest of the text, then we return "true."

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.799
But if we can't do that, then it's also okay, if we can skip the first character P, not match the first character P,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.566
and go ahead and match the rest of the pattern. So this matches when the first character matches;

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:29.366
this matches when the first character fails.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:33.266
That's all there is to do with match. But now we have two promises to keep:

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:36.366
We have to write match one and match star.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:41.732
Again, feel free to try them on your own if you want, but I'm going to go ahead and show them to you.

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:47.099
Match one is pretty easy. So we're matching a single character P against the text.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.066
If there is no text, a single character can't match against it, so we return "false."

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:58.266
Otherwise, if the P was a dot, that matches anything, so we should return "true."

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:03.866
Or if the P is exactly equal to the first character of the text, then we should return "true."

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:08.899
Now here's match star. We have a character P, we want to match any number of that, zero or more,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.299
and then match the rest of the pattern against the text.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.599
So how can we do that? Well, one way we can do it is by matching P zero times.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.132
So that's just matching the pattern against the text.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:29.266
Or we can match P one time against the text, and then do a match star of P followed by the pattern,

00:02:29.267 --> 00:02:32.999
against the rest of the text after the first character.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.132
Notice that it wouldn't do here to do a recursive call to match; we want a recursive call to match star.

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:48.999
Because we want to say we're matching either exactly zero times, or one time followed by zero or more times.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.532
That's it. And if we go ahead and run the test and print out the results, we find that all the tests pass.

00:02:56.533 --> 00:03:03.766
And I should say that the subset of the regular expression language and the approach we use to solve it,

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:11.332
I owe a lot to Rob Pike, who wrote a very nice essay on how to do this, and here's a URL link to it.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:18.299
And you'll be seeing Rob in an interview at the end of this class in the final unit.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.099
So that should give you some idea of what regular expressions are, how to write programs to process them,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.866
and a little bit of the power of what they can do.

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:32.066
Now, in this program, a regular expression was just a string,

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:35.999
and it was easy to deal with because all we had to deal with was the first character of the string,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.999
the second character of the string and so on. But regular expressions can get more complicated.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.166
They can have nested structures that are more like trees than strings.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:53.066
And so in the rest of this unit, we'll be dealing with an internal representation of regular expressions based on trees

00:03:53.067 --> 00:04:00.266
that will be different from this. You can still have input in the form of strings that gets translated into trees,

00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:03.032
but we'll be dealing with a tree structure from now on.

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:09.833
So this should give you an intro and a review that's good enough to handle the rest of the lesson.
