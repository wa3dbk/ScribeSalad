00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To implement the function C, I have to tell you about a new tool called a generator function,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is almost the same as a generator expression, and we'll show you what it looks like.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm going to define a function to iterate over the integers from some start to some end.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is going to be just like range.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Range is a great function, but sometimes it's annoying, because you really don't want

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to 1 less than the end. You want to go up all the way to the end.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's what ints is going to do. I'm going to implement it as a generator function.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm going to start off with an integer I that starts at start number that you told me.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then while i is less than or equal to the end

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm going to introduce a new type of statement here called yield,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I say yield i, and then I'll say i equals i plus 1.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, the yield is something new, and it makes this definition a generator function

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
rather than a regular function.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What that means is what's going to happen is it's going to execute.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
As soon as it sees this yield statement, it's going to generate that value i

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but keep it's place and when asked for the next, it will continue

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
incrementing i and then continuing through the loop.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When we call this function, if we say L equals the integers from 0 to 1 million,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
now L won't be a list right away.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It'll be a generator.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now L is equal to this generator, some funny object.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Then you call next of L to get the next object, and you keep on going through.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
More commonly, instead of calling next explicitly, you'd say for i in L.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And so generators obey this iteration protocol just like other types of sequences.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The great thing is we can yield from anywhere inside this function.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We get a very complicated logic here and then yield a partial result

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then continue getting the next result right where we are.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is a convenient feature for writing functions.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Another great thing about generator functions is it allows us to deal with infinite sequences.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's say we wanted to allow the possibility of an open ended interval of integers.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We'll make end be an optional argument, which can be None.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The idea is that if we have a call, say ints, starting at zero, but I don't give it a end,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
then that means all the non-negative integers--0, 1, 2, 3, going on forever and never stopping.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The question for you is how would you modify generator function in order

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
to make it obey this idea of never stopping when end is equal to None.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You should be able to modify just this line here to make it obey this idea

00:02:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that it should keep on going forever when end is None.
