Perhaps surprisingly, you're going to run into a very similar issue when you

00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:08.042
compare strings. Check out this code. I have two strings, Uda and city. I

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:11.470
concatenated the two together, to form a string that are called firstAndSecond.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.697
And over here I have a third string, Udacity. And now I check wether, the first

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:20.938
and second which we would expect to be Udacity, is the same as, Udacity. And if

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:24.634
so this program prints, they are the same, otherwise it prints what

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:29.536
firstAndSecond is. Again, go ahead and run this program yourself and tell me

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:37.683
what you find. Just put your output into this box.
