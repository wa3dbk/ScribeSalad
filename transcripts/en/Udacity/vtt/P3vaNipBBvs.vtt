00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.110
The first principle of knowledge based AI, as we have discussed it in CS7637,

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.540
is that AI agents use heuristics to find solutions that are good enough, but

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.020
not necessarily optimal. Some schools of AI put a lot of emphasis on

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.350
finding the optimal solution to every problem. In knowledge based AI,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.380
we consider agents that find solutions that are good enough.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.760
Herbert Simon called this satisficing. The reason for

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.415
finding solutions that are only good enough is because of the trade off between

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:34.820
computational efficiency on one hand and optimality of solutions on the other.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.775
We can find optimal solutions, but that comes with the cost of

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:42.990
computational efficiency. Recall one of the conundrums of AI. AI agents

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.520
are with limited resources, bounded rationality, limited processing power,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.670
limited memory size. Yet, most intrusting problems are impractical. How can

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.720
we get AI agents to solve impractical problems with limited rationality and yet

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.230
give nearly a ten performance? We can get AI agents to do that if we can

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.510
focus on finding solutions that are good enough, but not necessarily optimum.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.450
Most of the time you and I as human agents do not find optimum solutions.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.040
The plan you may have to make dinner for

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.090
yourself tonight is not necessarily optimum, it's just good enough.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.760
The plan that you have to go from your house to your office is not

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.510
necessary optimal, it's just good enough. The plan that you have to walk from

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.370
your car to your office is not necessary optimal, it's just good enough.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.170
Further, AI agents use heuristics to find solutions that are good enough.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.660
They do not do an exhaustive search, even the exhaustive search might yield

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.000
more optimal solutions because exhaustive search is computationally costly.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.040
We came across this notion of heuristic search several times in this course.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.640
Once place where we discussed this in some detail, was in incremental concept

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.150
learning. Given a current concept definition and a negative example, we arrive

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.762
at a new concept definition by using heuristics like require-link heuristic.

00:01:59.762 --> 00:02:04.230
The require-link heuristic adds the must clause to this support link

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.110
between these two bricks. Mean-sense analysis was a heuristic method. It said

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.950
that given the current position and the goal position, find the differences and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.080
then select an operator that will reduce the difference. Because mean-sense

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.500
analysis was a heuristic method sometimes it ran into problems and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.150
did not follow guarantees of optimality. But when it worked,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.976
it was very efficient. Another case where we explicitly made use of heuristic

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:32.930
laws in the generate interest method. Here we had a heuristic which said,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.570
do not generate a state that duplicates a previously generated state

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.215
which made the method more efficient. Does the focus of knowledge based

00:02:40.215 --> 00:02:44.270
AI agents is a near real time performance? They're addressing computational

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.360
intractable problems with bounded resources. And yet being able to solve a very

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.700
large class of problems in robust intelligence and flexible intelligence. And

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.790
that happens not by finding optimal solutions to a narrow class of problems, but

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.890
by using heuristics to find solutions that are good enough to very large classes

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.600
of problems. This principle comes very much from theories of human cognition.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.040
As I mentioned earlier, humans do not normally find optimal solutions for

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.870
every problem they face. However, we do manage to find solutions that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.650
are good enough, and we do so in near real time, and that's where the power lies
