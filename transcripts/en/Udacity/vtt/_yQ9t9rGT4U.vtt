00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.370
Throughout this course we'll be using
an example application called app.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.070
In our app we have three applications.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.110
Monolith, Hello and Off Service.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.130
The Monolith service combines
authentication and Hello micro services.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.030
Let's run the monolithic application
now to see how it works.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.840
Our application is built and we can
test this functionality using curl and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.540
we can see we got a response back.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.920
It's working.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.630
Now let's try the secure end point.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.920
The request fails because
we need to get a JWT token.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.410
&gt;From the log in end point.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.000
So let's do that now.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.640
I'm going to tie password at the prompt.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.240
Now that I have a JWT token, can I can
hit the secure end point using curl and

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.890
it should work.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.120
As expected everything is working now.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.210
A couple of things about the example
service I should point out.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.960
While it's a monolithic application.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.060
It does leverage many principles
found in 12 factor applications.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.780
For example,
we are logging to standard output so

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.750
logging tools can pick up our logs
without touching any log files.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.160
You'll also notice the model of
application is self-contained.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.939
We are but only all of our
dependencies in the vendor directory.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.620
Following these practices make our
application easier to maintain and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.420
deploy to the cloud, something
we're striving for in this course.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.380
I'll kick it over to Carter to
explain more about 12 factor and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.740
micro services in depth.
