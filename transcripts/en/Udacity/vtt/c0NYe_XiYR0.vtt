00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So maybe you already see a pattern emerging here, but I am now going to

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
deviate just a little bit from this. I am now going to add 3 vertices here, 3 vertices here,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
3 vertices here, 3 vertices here, so this is a total of 12 vertices.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And just so that we keep that in mind here, up here we have 8, here we have 12,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and here we have 24 in these layers here. Now how am I going to connect those?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And this is where the picture gets actually quite messy. I'm going to connect

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
them to all those here. So each of these 3 vertices here that I've added is connected

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to 6 other vertices, so there's 6 edges going out here--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--and what you see

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
also is that each of the vertices here in this layer--the first layer that I added--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is connected to exactly 5 vertices. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And of course I deliberately

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
constructed this in this way, and I'm going to draw these out here in a minute.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I just want you to understand the principle. I've added these 12 vertices here in a way

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
such that the greedy algorithm will first take these 12 here, then it will take these 8 here,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and then it will take these 12 here. So I'm constructing my graph so that the greedy

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
algorithm will choose the vertices in exactly the reverse order that I am adding them

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to the network. And in that way I can make that algorithm behave very, very, very badly.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You would think that theoretical computer science is a clean and not messy science,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but I think I can just show you the opposite here. But you get the principle now.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So these 24 vertices here are the first ones that I have added, and I have now added

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
these layers here. So I first added these 12 here, then these 8, then these 12 here

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in such a way that the greedy algorithm will choose these vertices here to be in a

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
vertex cover and these here in a vertex cover. So the question, of course, now is,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
can I add even more vertices to this so that I am still making the greedy algorithm

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
take my new vertices that I add? And in fact I can, but it will become really messy

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
to draw. So I'm more going to explain to you how I'm going to do this rather than

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
actually draw out every single vertex. So you see for each of the vertices

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that I've added here, I've connected them to larger and larger groups of these vertices

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
here in the middle of those original 24, and I can continue this for a little bit by now

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
adding 2 vertices which would then be connected to groups of 8 down here.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So this would be connected to all over here, and then I will do the same part here.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So again I can add 2 vertices here, and I will connect them to this group of 8,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
then 2 more vertices here, and I will connect them to this group of 8.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And if you want, you can of course check. It will still be such that the 6 vertices

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I've now added will be the first ones that are picked by the greedy algorithm.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And then those 12, and then those 8, and then those 12.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
What I can then do is I can add another 4 vertices, and this time I will look at

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
groups of 12. So I will add 4 vertices connected to these 12 here in the middle,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and I will add 4 vertices connected to these 12 here in the middle.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And we'll be done soon, so in case you think this gets very tedious, bear with me

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
for just another moment here, and we'll be done.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So we've added another 8 vertices, and again these will be the first ones picked by

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the greedy algorithm. And final addition of vertices actually. I will add

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
another 11 vertices. And these vertices will be connected to all 24.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Now my question for you is, how large is a minimum vertex cover for this network

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that I've constructed here? And remember every vertex is connected to those 24

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
vertices here in the middle. So please enter the size of the minimum vertex cover

00:04:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
here into this box.
