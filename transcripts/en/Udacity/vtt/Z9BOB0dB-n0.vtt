00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.185
The sample size for the Placebo group is 5. And we'll multiply that by 1.5

00:00:06.185 --> 00:00:13.382
minus 1.835, and then square it. Then we'll add the sample size for Drug 1

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:19.770
times the mean for Drug 1 minus the grand means squared. Drug 2 has 7 in the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.690
sample, which we'll multiply by the squared deviation. And drug 3 has 4. After

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.259
we do all this, we get 5.45.
