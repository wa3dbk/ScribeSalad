00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you find that all these invariant checkers become tedious to write,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you may consider a language where invariants, pre and post conditions, are all built in.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is the case in Bertrand Meyer's Eiffel language.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In Eiffel, invariants become part of the classes.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The invariant also are named, so if an invariant is violated,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the name of the invariant becomes part of the diagnostic message.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here we have rootHasNoParent and what this does is simply checks

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
whether the root attribute is a valid pointer--that is, it's not a void pointer.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is unequal in Eiffel, and this is what another language is called a null pointer.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here we have the invariant rootIsBlack and it simply checks the color attribute

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of the root note to be black and of course, there's more to it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Once you have defined such an invariant, the invariant will be automatically checked.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Actually, it will be checked precisely according to the rules we set up previously.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Do you still remember them? So when does Eiffel check its invariants?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Is it whenever some class attribute is read, whenever some attribute is written,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
at the beginning of each public method in the class, or is it at the end of each public method?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Check all that apply.
