00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.091
We just talked about how the Pythagorean theoem says that if you have a right

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.234
triangle, and you square the shortest side, and add to that the square of the

00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:12.435
second shortest side, then what you get as the sum is the square of the longest

00:00:12.447 --> 00:00:16.636
side of the triangle. The longest side of a right triangle is also known as the

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:20.837
hypoteneuse, that's a word you may have heard before. What I would like you to

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.587
tell me is how long the hypoteneus of this triangle is. Should this question

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.064
mark be replaced by 225, 15, 12, 9 root 3, 9 root 2, or 9?
