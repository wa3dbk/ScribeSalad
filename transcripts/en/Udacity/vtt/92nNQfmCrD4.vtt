00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.130
Now we need a way to quantify this and we do that much the same way that we

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.970
calculate the standard deviation. We take each residual, in other words the

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.340
observed minus expected value. We square them to get rid of negatives. That's

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.710
the same as finding the area of each of these squares. That essentially we find

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.490
the average square. But we correct for the fact that it's a sample, by dividing

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.800
by N-2, where N is the number of points. In this case there are six. And then

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.710
finally, we take the square root to put it back into terms of distance rather

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.840
than squared values. This is called the standard error of the estimate.
