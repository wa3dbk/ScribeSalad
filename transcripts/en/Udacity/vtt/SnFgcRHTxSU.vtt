00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.172
Sometimes we want to convert equations from being in the general form to being

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.012
in slope-intercept form, since it's easier to read off the slope and the

00:00:08.012 --> 00:00:12.228
intercept when it's written this way. Just real quick, try to do this with the

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:13.892
equation 12x plus 5y equals 7.
