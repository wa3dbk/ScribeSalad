00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.750
Visualizations like this one are a core component of exploratory

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.840
data analysis. We're going to be using the R programming

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.756
language to create these types of visualizations and to explore

00:00:09.756 --> 00:00:12.340
data throughout the course. You can read more about the R

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.510
programming language and how it was developed by clicking on

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.773
the link in the instructor notes. We'll also learn about RStudio,

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:22.380
which is this program. It's a graphical user interface for

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.410
programming in R. You'll learn all about RStudio in the next

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.010
lesson, and future lessons will cover visualization and statistical

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.040
techniques for data exploration. We'll start by examining one variable

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.600
at a time in a dataset. This will give us

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.660
an idea of its underlining distribution and what type of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.040
values the variable takes on. Eventually our visualizations will

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.390
become more complex as we look at pairs of variables

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.880
and multiple variables all at once. At the end of

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.460
the course you'll have the chance to conduct your own

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.880
exploratory data analysis. I hope you're getting excited

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.020
to explore data. See you in the next lesson.
