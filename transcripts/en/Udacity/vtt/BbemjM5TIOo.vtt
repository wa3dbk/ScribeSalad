00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.724
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; To say this mathematically, I would have to have an ordered pair, or an x and

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:09.693
a y. The x tells me the horizontal distance, in this case 2. And the y tells me

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:14.714
the vertical distance, in this case 4. We call this an ordered pair or we could

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:19.953
think about calling these the coordinates of the point. So, where would you find

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.520
the point for 3? Choose the best answer.
