00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.410
You're still here.
All right, don't tell Catherine, but

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.370
I made a bonus lesson for you guys.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.080
So this lesson is optional, but for

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.290
those of you who are eager
to learn more, stick around.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.230
So we'll show you how to add some
new features to your tool belt.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.740
So in this lesson, you'll learn about an
Android component called a view pager,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.940
which will allow users
to easily swipe left and

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.270
right between the vocabulary words list.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.980
And this means one less click
between the user and their content.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.540
Now similar to the ListView, the view
pager's populated using an adapter.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.540
So you'll get another opportunity to
see how adopters are using Android.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.290
Now let's started.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.610
&gt;&gt; Jessica,
what are you still doing here?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.280
Hello, Jessica, I see you here,
what are you saying to the student?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.080
Okay, I have better things to do,
I'm going to go home.
