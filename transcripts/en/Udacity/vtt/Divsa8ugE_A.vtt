00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.880
There's no question that even
simple models of computers,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.340
the models that ignore the memory
hierarchy, parallelism, and

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.770
communication have, nevertheless,
been extremely productive.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.340
In other words,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.890
the CS community has produced an amazing
array of applications without having to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.300
think too hard about the physical
realities of machines.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.240
Or so it seems.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.690
But if we are in fact approaching
the end of Moore's Law and

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.550
as we hit new performance bottlenecks
like limits on power and energy.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.240
Then I think you have to stop and
ask yourself the kind of basic questions

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.240
that Danny Hillis was
asking in the early 80s.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.660
These are questions like, how do we
make the most of the machines we have?

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.820
Is there a role for physical reality and
the design of algorithms and software?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.460
And how exactly would we do all that and
still be productive developers?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.790
These unrelated questions are at
the frontier of HPC research.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.270
They include wackier ideas like quantum
computing and biological computing.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.320
These are among the main
extremes of physical computation.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.060
Now, while our course won't go so far
as to talk about these wackier ideas,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.870
lucky for you, there's plenty of time
afterwards for you to think about that.
