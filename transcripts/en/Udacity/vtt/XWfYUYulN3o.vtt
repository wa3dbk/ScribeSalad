00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.660
Just one more question, and then you'll have a few more practice questions to

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.327
have some fun with. What if we have 12 is less than 4 x? I'd like you, however,

00:00:07.327 --> 00:00:10.975
to put the x on the left side of the solution, and then fill-in what inequality

00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:14.844
symbol belongs here. Input answer belongs on this side. You might want to check

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:19.004
on either side of the endpoint of the inequality or the dividing mark between

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:23.229
the solutions and the non-solutions to see if you have the inequality sign the

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.310
right way around.
