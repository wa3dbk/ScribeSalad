00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.961
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's get back to renting cars. This time you want to rent a car, and you're

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:08.429
comparing the cost between two companies, Car-nival and Rent-a-Car. Car-nival's

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.478
the same as before. They're going to charge $10 for a registration fee and $10

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:16.606
per hour for renting the car. Rent-a-car is a little bit different. They're

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:20.742
going to charge $30 for a registration fee and $6 per hour for renting the car.

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:25.126
So, which company's the better deal? Is it Car-nival, Rent-a-Car, does it

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:29.428
depend, do they cost the same, or would you rather teleport? This is one of

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:33.870
those questions you really want to take your time on. Try to create a table of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.449
values for Car-nival and Rent-a-Car. You can let x be the number of hours and y

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.102
be the cost of the rental car. You can use the table to investigate this or even

00:00:43.102 --> 00:00:44.925
create a graph. Try your best.
