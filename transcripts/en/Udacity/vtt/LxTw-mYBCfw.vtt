00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.990
Before we get to the practice for this lesson, let's try some number puzzles.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.028
This time the top numbers are negative. This means that one of that factors has

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:12.025
to be negative, since a negative times a positive is a negative number. I want

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:16.247
you to find the factors for these number puzzles. Remember, we want to find two

00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:20.663
numbers that multiply to the top number, but some to the bottom number, And it

00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:23.609
doesn't matter which order you place the factors.
