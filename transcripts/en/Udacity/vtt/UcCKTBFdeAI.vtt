We've already seen cache first
used to store our app shell.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.800
If the request matches a cache entry,
respond with that.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.980
Otherwise, try to fetch
the resource from the network.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.920
Cache first then network is ideal for
storing commonly used resources.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.340
Such as storing the key
components of the app shell.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.380
Be careful when using this strategy for
application data or

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.730
resources that change frequently.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.980
Otherwise you might get stale data.
