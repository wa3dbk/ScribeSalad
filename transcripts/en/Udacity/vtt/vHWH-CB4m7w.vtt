00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.790
When we talk about Virtualization.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.820
When we look at CPUs in memory.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.360
Certain things are relatively
less complicated,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.080
in spite of everything that we said,
so far.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.000
Because there is a significant
level of standardization

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.390
at the instruction set architecture,
across different platforms.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.620
So then from
a Virtualization standpoint,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.310
we know that we have to
support a specific ISA.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.430
And then we don't care if there
are lower level differences

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.630
between the hardware because it's up
to the hardware manufacturers to be

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.660
standardized at the ISA level.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.545
This clearly is the case for
a particular ISA for instance, for

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:46.230
x86 things will be different across
x86 and for instance MIPS platforms.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.910
When we look at devices however,
there is a much greater diversity in

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.320
the types of devices, if we compare that
to the types of CPU instruction sets.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.390
And also there is lack of
standardization when it comes to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.280
the specifics of the device interface
and the semantics of that interface,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.060
so what is the behaviour when
a particular call is invoked.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.710
How a particular device
should respond to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.230
a call to send the packet for instance.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.320
To deal with this diversity,
Virtualization solutions adopt

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.780
one of three key models,
to virtualize devices.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.760
We will describe these models, next.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.180
And note that they were developed
before any Virtualization friendly

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.430
hardware extensions were made to the,
CP architectures and the chip sets.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.820
And these new modifications
of the hardware

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.620
make some aspects of device
Virtualization much simpler than

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.570
than what originally it was when
these models were first introduced.
