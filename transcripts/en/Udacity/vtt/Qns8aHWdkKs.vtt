00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.736
Here's your third parabola. Where do you think this vertex is? And then try and

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:08.718
create its graph. Now, you want to pay close attention when you go to complete

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:13.684
the square, since there's a negative 2 here. Also, think about the orientation

00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:18.359
of your parabola. Which way should it open? When you think you've got the graph

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.344
and the vertex into the vertex here. And then check your graph in the solution

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:23.060
video.
