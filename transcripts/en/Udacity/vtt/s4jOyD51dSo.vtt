00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.951
So, how are we going to do the direction

00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:05.360
prediction? We are going to have a table that

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.140
we will call, a Branch History Table, or BHT.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.026
We will take the PC of the instruction, grab

00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:14.614
the least significant bits, and that's what we index

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.750
into this table with. So, it's the same, as

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.860
when indexing into the BTB. But the entry here

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.664
is much smaller. The simplest predictor will simply have

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:28.997
a 1-bit here, that tells us if this is

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:33.239
a not a taken branch, meaning it's a non-branch

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.572
or a not taken branch or when it's one,

00:00:36.572 --> 00:00:40.470
it says that this is a taken branch. If we

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.180
get a zero from here, we just increment the PC. If we get a one, we use the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.894
BTB to tell us where to go. Just like

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:50.887
we were updating the BTB, we can update this once

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:54.880
we resolve the branch. If we resolve to a

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.380
taken branch then we put a one here and we

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.650
write the destination address into the BTB. If we

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.425
get a zero, if we, decide that the branch is

00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.975
not taken or that the instruction is not a

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:09.832
branch. Then we put a zero here and we don't

00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:12.264
update the BTB so that we can use the BTB

00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:15.988
only for target addresses that we really, really need the

00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:21.420
BTB for. Because an entry here can be only a single bit.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130
This table can be quite large, so we can have lots of instructions. Have

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.320
entries here, avoiding conflicts between instructions

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.500
that commonly execute, while still reserving the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.450
small BTB, which had much fewer entries only for branches in that code.
