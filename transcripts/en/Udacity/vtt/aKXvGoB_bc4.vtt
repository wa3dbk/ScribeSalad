00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is 01011010.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let me explain why.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Remember that we're using CBC mode encryption.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The value of ciphertext block i is the result of encrypting, using the key.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The value of ciphertext block i -1 XORed with message block i.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For the first block of the second message, that's going to be c0'.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's the result of encrypting the value of the previous block,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and this was the initialization vector for the first block.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
For this one, it's the last block in the previous message.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That was the block we call c(n-1).

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's XORed with message block 0.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Here is the danger. The adversary actually knows this value.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That means the adversary can pick a message value so the value of c0' reveals something.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That means it has to be an input to the encryption.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're assuming the adversary can't break the encryption.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But it has to be an input to the encryption the adversary already knows what

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the expected result is.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The adversary knows the encryptions of all the blocks in the previous message,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and we know from the way CBC worked, if we want to learn the value of m4--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
m4 was encrypted in the original message using the value here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This was ciphertext 3--the previous ciphertext block--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and that was encrypted and it produces output--ciphertext block 4.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That means if we can feed into this result, that means if we can make the value of this

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
equal to the result of c3 XORed with m4--we don't know m4,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but we can make it our guess for m4.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We're going to XOR it with our guess for m*--m4.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If that's the input to the encryption function, then we'll be able to look at the output

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and see if it matches c4.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
To make that the input, we have this IV, which is really the last block in the previous message.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We can just XOR that out.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
What we're going to pass in is the guess XORed with the known value of c3

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
XORed with this value.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
With the values I've chosen, c3 is this, m* is all zeros, so we don't need to worry about that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in the XOR, and c(n-1)--the last ciphertext block--is all the 1s.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's going to flip the first 5 bits. That's why we get this value.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's see what happens when that value is used for m0.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What we're going to get for ciphertext block 0 is the result of encrypting

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the known value of ciphertext block n -1 with this result, which is c3.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now this is XORed so that same values cancel out.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That means the result is the result of encrypting c3

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
XORed with m*.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
That's the same as we were doing here.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
That's encrypting m4 XORed with c3.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We know what c3 is. We could construct this message to pass in.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We don't know what m4 is, but we know if this result is the same,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
then this should be the same as ciphertext block 4.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That would give us the answer to the question was m4 equal to m*.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Of course, we can generalize this.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
If we can pick the value of m0' to be the XOR of the last ciphertext block

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and the one before the one we want to guess and our guess,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that means what we learn if the ciphertext block that results from the new message

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
is equal to ciphertext block i, then we know that block mi is equal to m*.
