00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.930
Well, we want to get x on one side of the equation. So let's subtract x from

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:12.075
both sides. I'll get negative x plus zx plus zy equals 0. Remember, I can't

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:16.560
combine this negative x with either this term or this term since the variables

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.710
are completely different. To isolate these two terms that have x, I subtract zy

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.754
from both sides. This gives me negative x plus zx equals negative zy. Now, this

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:33.910
equation doesn't quite match any of these. So there must be something else I can

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.706
do. Well, let's multiply this equation through by a negative 1. If we multiply

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:43.284
every term by a negative 1, we really change all of these signs. This will

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:47.773
become positive, this will become negative and this will become positive. So x

00:00:47.773 --> 00:00:55.952
minus zx is equal to zy. Well, that would be this one here, x minus zx equal to

00:00:55.952 --> 00:01:00.614
zy. This equation has just been flipped over. This was the tough way to do it.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:04.732
Let me show you a quicker way. We know we want to get these x terms alone on one

00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:09.710
side of the equation. So if we just subtract zx from both sides, we get there a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.440
lot quicker. Zy is equal to x minus zx. This is where your algebra skills can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.440
come into play. If you think a little bit forward you can predict what you're

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.913
going to get. Try and choose the simpler method. Having two x terms isolated on

00:01:23.913 --> 00:01:28.122
the right side of the equation is the same as having x terms isolated on the

00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:33.363
left side of the equation. This one just happens to be much easier.
