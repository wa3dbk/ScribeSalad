00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.360
Here's the car painted with diffuse paint. Something you probably never see in

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.850
the real world. With just a directional light on representing the sun. Notice

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.088
how the area in shadow is entirely dark. Filling this with a solid ambient

00:00:11.088 --> 00:00:14.372
light wouldn't look much better. The final result, showing the surrounding

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:18.168
environment in shadows gives a highly realistic effect. This demo runs at

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:21.708
interactive rates. Looking at demos like this gets me excited to add another

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:26.320
ten lessons on various topics that have to do with texturing. For example, I'm

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.670
feeling a bit guilty that I haven't talked about high-dynamic-range textures,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.270
HDR for short. The quick version about HDR textures is that they're used to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.120
capture a wide range of lighting levels, basically, more bits per channel. This

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.090
wide range is particularly useful for environment maps as the light sources in

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.573
the scene can in reality be magnitudes brighter than other objects. Think of

00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:47.714
the sun. These textures allow a variety of materials to use them in a more

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.690
physically believable fashion, and also, avoid banding artifacts due to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.828
precision limits. For example, some objects such as plastics mostly pick up

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:58.891
just bright lights as reflections and little else. HDR textures allow us to use

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.375
the same environment map for these materials as well as highly reflective metal

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:03.860
surfaces.
