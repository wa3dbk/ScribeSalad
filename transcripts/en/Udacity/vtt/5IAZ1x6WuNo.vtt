00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.527
Creativity is not simply original thinking, after all both of these paragraphs

00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:07.700
are equally original. They're both unusual and both give voice to sentences

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.156
that are probably never been uttered or written before these writers penned

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:16.040
them. So, for something to be deemed creative however, it must not only be

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.332
original, but it also must be useful and adaptive and solve a problem. James

00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:24.992
Joyce's paragraph does that, because it's part of solving the problem of

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:30.950
telling a story. The second paragraph is not creative, because it's not useful.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.560
It doesn't solve a problem. By useful, we clearly do not mean pragmatic. James

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.962
Joyce's novel was useful in the sense that he was the first novelist to write

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:45.293
from the perspective of inside a person's unconcious mind. It has been so

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:48.632
esteemed and deemed creative by experts and readers of English literature

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:53.700
because it presented a powerful study of unconscious human thought and emotion.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.543
It can be useful in a literary, artistic, or aesthetic sense, in that people

00:00:57.543 --> 00:01:03.090
are inspired by it and make use of it in their own creations. The second quote,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.646
is equally as original but does not solve an important problem. In any useful

00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:12.038
or adaptive way. By itself, these phrases may be interesting but together,

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:17.062
they're not terribly coherent. Or were not made with the intent of shedding

00:01:17.062 --> 00:01:22.228
light on the inner workings of a human mind as was "Ulysses". So. Creative

00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:27.800
thought and behavior requires two things. Originality or novelty of the thought

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.765
and behavior, and that thought and behavior has to be useful and adaptive

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:37.219
solution to some kind of problem. So new forms of art and literature,

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.226
architecture, science technology, and business changed their fields. The field

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:47.459
is different after the insight or innovation. Creativity changes things for the

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.532
better. Of course the usefulness, our originality may not be immediately seen

00:01:51.532 --> 00:01:56.503
or appreciated. Truly creative thought, behavior may be well ahead of it's

00:01:56.503 --> 00:02:01.680
time. So the evaluation of creativity is not limited to the here and now.
