00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.699
To make a 15% mixture, we would need 4 liters. If you got that one right, that's

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:09.323
amazing work. You've really mastered how to solve these system problems. If this

00:00:09.323 --> 00:00:13.836
one gave you trouble, that's okay. Stay with me to figure out what might have

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:18.525
gone wrong. The question asks for how much of the 15% mixture we should use. So

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:23.252
that's going to be our variable, x. We start with 10 liters of a chemical

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:28.398
mixture that is 8% water. So that's going to be my percent 1 and volume 1. For

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:33.847
percent 2 and volume 2, I'm adding 15% of x liters of solution. And for my final

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:39.118
percentage, I know the mixture needs to be 10% water. I don't know my final

00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:44.040
volume. But if I remember back from the bucket, if I pour in one volume, and I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.146
pour in another volume, that gives me my total volume. So I poured in 10 liters

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:54.259
first, and then I poured in x liters. This must mean that the total volume is 10

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:59.294
plus x. I can use that here. Now we have one equation with one variable, and we

00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:05.566
can solve for x. I multiply my terms together, and then I distribute the 0.10.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:11.692
Next, I subtract 0.8 from both sides. I'm moving my constant terms to the right.

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:17.026
This means that I must move my x terms to the left. I subtract 0.1x from both

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:22.899
sides to get 0.05x equals 0.2. And finally I divide by the coefficient of x, to

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.948
get x is equal to 10 liters.
