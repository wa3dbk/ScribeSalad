00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.920
The answer here is Markov Models.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.080
Some of you may have been
tempted with Decision Trees,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.730
but keep in mind in a Decision Tree,
there's no recursion.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.000
Here, we're talking about
the progression of patients,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
both treated and untreated patients
with hypertension over time.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.230
A patient, for example,
may be well-controlled, but

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.912
a certain percentage of those patients
may stop taking their medications so

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:26.190
they're going to go back to
a more complicated state.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.660
Decision Trees can't model that sort
of behavior, but Markov Models can.
