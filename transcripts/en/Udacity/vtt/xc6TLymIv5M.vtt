00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.557
So today we're with Dr., Erika Rosenberg. And she's an expert in the psychology

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:08.890
of emotion and facial expression of emotion. So Erika, can you tell us

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.790
something about how you got into this field of study?

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.474
&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting because it's not something I thought I would do when I

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:18.832
was a kid. That I would study facial expressions of emotion. But if you look at

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:22.540
my, my baby pictures, it might have predicted this. But, I was interested in

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.382
the effects of emotions on health. in, in general, I was interested in stress

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:30.371
and health, I went to the University of California San Francisco in their

00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:35.120
Health Psychology program to get my PhD. After my first year, I met Paul Ekman

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.774
who was a professor there. And I found out he had really developed this field,

00:00:39.774 --> 00:00:45.286
of the scientific study of facial expressions of emotions. So, that's how I

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:50.700
started working on it. I saw the face as a tool, to learn, to measure emotion.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.988
&gt;From a purely research point of view. But, once I got into it, it led to this

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:59.685
whole series of fascinating applications for studying the face.

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:03.894
&gt;&gt; Well, can you tell us something about, what was some of the groundbreaking work

00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:06.410
that was done early on?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.252
&gt;&gt; Right, right, right. I mean, it's interest in the face in studying emotion

00:01:10.252 --> 00:01:15.185
actually goes pretty far back. It started in the nineteenth century when

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:18.683
Charles Darwin, published a book, you know, in 1872, called The Expressions of

00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:23.570
the Emotions in Man and Animals. Where he, he had all these wonderful drawings,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.424
and photographs, of animals, and humans. A lot of the pictures were of his

00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:30.609
kids, making different emotions faces, and he was trying to make the argument

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:35.515
that there's fundamental about how emotion is shown. Not just in humans but in

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:40.214
a variety of animal species. That is, sort of inborn inate. And he had, he did

00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:43.427
very informal research methods of having people all over the world send him

00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:46.691
pictures from their journeys or drawings at the time, and saying, if you show

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:52.379
these pictures to people, do they recognize them as the same ones we do. And

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:56.411
his anecdotal evidence We're pretty consistent that there was a small set of

00:01:56.411 --> 00:02:00.569
emotions that are conveyed with certain facial actions that's consistent for

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.934
all humans.

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:04.214
&gt;&gt; All over the world.

00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:08.294
&gt;&gt; All over the world. And his research methods were not real precise. And in the

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:12.001
early 20th century, this idea of things being in born, was not very popular

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:17.997
because behaviorism was just getting going. And it took until The, the 1960s,

00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:25.056
actually when Ekman and Friesen did their pioneering work. Not just to other

00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:28.143
industrialized nations, because they'd found some agreement consistent with

00:02:28.143 --> 00:02:33.016
Darwin's, in industrialized countries. But they decided, if you really want to

00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:36.670
find out if something's innate, not learned, then you have to go to cultures

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.860
where they're not sharing the kind of information that we share in

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.172
industrialized nations. So he went with an anthropologist friend to Papua New

00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:51.370
Guinea, which at that time, no longer, was a preliterate culture. They didn't

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.600
have exposure to any western films or whatever. And, Ekman and Friesen showed

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.630
members of two different tribes there, some of the photographs they'd used of

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.660
certain poses of facial expression of emotion, but most of those people were,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.941
you know, European-American looking. So they also gathered photos from the New

00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.783
Guineans themselves, and used a variety of different methodologies. And

00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:18.626
surprised both Eckman because he didn't expect to find this, and the scientific

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:22.530
community that there were about five or six different emotions for which the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.628
facial configurations were consistency recognized the same. Both in you know,

00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:32.447
at the time, Eckman was in Berklely. Berkely, California. And of Papua New

00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:35.860
Guinea. So that seemed to speak very powerfully to the idea that there were

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.352
universal facial expressions of emotions. But this was a small set. So, we're

00:03:41.352 --> 00:03:46.044
talking about anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness and surprise, about six

00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:50.144
emotions. To model these universal expressions, I'm going to need to take my

00:03:50.144 --> 00:03:54.712
glasses off. Now the important thing to remember is that these are prototypes

00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:57.998
so like any prototype this is sort of like a classic just like a, an apple's a

00:03:57.998 --> 00:04:03.658
classic fruit and there's other fruits that are not you know as typical. This

00:04:03.658 --> 00:04:06.934
is sort of the prototypical example of each of these emotions that I'm going to

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:11.430
show you. So I'll start with anger. Anger the brows are lowered, the upper

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.260
eyelid is lifted, the lower eyelid is tense, and the lips are pressed together.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.284
So I can't talk while I do that so I'll do this. That's anger.

00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:22.522
[LAUGH]

00:04:22.522 --> 00:04:31.668
This is disgust. A key sign of disgust is the wrinkling of the nose. Fear.

00:04:31.668 --> 00:04:48.692
Happiness. Sadness. And surprise. And this is an emotion that later work has

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:52.346
suggested is likely to be universal or at least has some good cross cultural

00:04:52.346 --> 00:04:58.882
agreement, and that's the emotion of content. Which is the only of the set of

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:05.198
universals that is only, really, a unilateral or asymmetrical expression.

00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:12.984
That's contempt. So. But contempt wasn't one of the emotions they used in the

00:05:12.984 --> 00:05:13.959
early word.
