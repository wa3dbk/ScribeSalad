00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.440
So how do we implement the least
recently used policy that

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.310
works really well?

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.420
And it works really because
it exploits well locality.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.356
The most recently used thing is likely
to be used very soon afterwards.

00:00:12.356 --> 00:00:15.495
The thing that we haven't used for
a while means that there is less

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:19.405
reason for locality to kind of
cause it to be accessed again.

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:22.015
Let's say we have a four way
set associative cache and

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.285
let's just track what's
happening in this one set.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.215
So there is four blocks in it.

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:30.400
For each of these blocks we
keep the tag and the valid bit.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.980
And in order to track which
block was accessed when,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.950
we are going to also have
an LRU counter for each block.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.200
These counters take values that
correspond to the size of the set.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.680
In this case, 0 through 3 because
there are four things in the set.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.450
So let's initialize them to 0,
1, 2, and 3.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.050
They have to all be
different all the time, and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.270
we will see how that is maintained.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.350
So, we start like this.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.370
When we want to replace something,
we will replace the block whose count it

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.210
is currently 0 because that's going to
be the least recently used block.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.940
So, let's say we access some block, A.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.530
And we need to put it somewhere.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.360
We will choose the place with
the 0 counter and put it there.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.460
Now that the block is placed there,
the processor accessing it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.720
and suddenly this becomes
the most recently used block.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.980
So, it's counter now needs to be 3.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.960
In order to make sure that all of
the counters still have different values

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.410
that means that all of the other
counters now need to be decremented.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.950
So, the one that was 1 becomes 0.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.540
2 becomes 1, and 3 becomes 2.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.790
And now,
let's say that we access sum block B.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.190
We put it here,
because the counter is 0, now, here.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.800
When B is accessed after putting
it here, that counter becomes 3.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.660
This one becomes 2.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.650
This one becomes 0 and
this one becomes 1.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.130
We will now put in block C here.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.760
That becomes 3.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.740
This becomes 2.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.661
This becomes 1.

00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.426
This becomes 0.

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:07.500
D, 3, 2, 1, 0.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.490
Now we're back to this situation.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.640
So I'm going to clean up here.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.670
And now, if we access E,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.920
we're going to find what was
the least recently used block.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.720
And A, at this point, is because it's
been accessed the least recently.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.160
So A will be replaced by E.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.400
And the LRU counter here becomes 3
which brings these one notch lower.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.750
So this is the state we have.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.200
Now let's say that B, which is the least
recently used block now, is re-accessed.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.900
What happens then is this
counter needs to become 3.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.450
All of the other ones now
need to be changed lower.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.860
What happens if the most recently block,
let's say, B is accessed again?

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.812
Then this count just stays at 3 because
that indicates that this is already

00:02:56.812 --> 00:02:58.704
the most recently accessed block.

00:02:58.704 --> 00:03:02.807
What happens if block D,
which is neither the most nor

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:05.368
the least recent, is accessed?

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:10.820
Well this counter needs to become 3 and
now we have an interesting situation.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.370
We don't just lower all
the other counters a notch down.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.160
We take the ones that were above
the original value of this counter.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.350
So we take the counter that is above 1,
and

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.940
those are the ones
that get a notch down.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.580
But the ones that are below
one stay the same.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.920
That ensures that the counters
still have different values.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.840
let's do another one of those
where let's say block B,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.530
that is almost the most recently
used block, is accessed.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.190
In that case this counter
needs to become 3.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.325
All counters that were above its
original value of 2 need to be

00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:48.390
decremented.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.290
So, this becomes 2, but these two stay
the same because they're below 2.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.670
So again, we have this situation.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.851
So now you know how to maintain
the LRU counters properly.

00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:06.423
After every step you can verify that
the counters have different values.

00:04:06.423 --> 00:04:10.439
If they don't, then you probably
made a mistake somewhere.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.619
So as you can see maintaining
LRU is relatively complicated.

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:18.432
For an N-way set-associative cache,

00:04:18.432 --> 00:04:22.700
we need N counters
whose size is LOG2(N).

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.683
In this case the size of the counters is
2 bit because they need to have a number

00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:34.230
between 0 and 3 to tell us where are we
in the order of access in the set.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.290
So it's a four way set
associative cache,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.200
that means we need two bits
per counter and four counters.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.880
So for highly associative cache it's
something like 32 way associated.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.220
You would need to have 5 bit
counters and 32 of them per set.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.730
So this was the cost.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.490
It's pretty high.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.930
Worse, there is an energy problem.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.010
We need to modify up to N
counters on each access,

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.960
even cache hits that can
happen very frequently.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.740
So the LRU approximations try
to keep fewer counters and

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.200
do fewer updates on cache hits.
