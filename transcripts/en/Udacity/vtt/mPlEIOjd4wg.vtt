00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.406
And the answer is that, m represents the slope. We can see 2 is the slope for

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:09.162
this equation and 1 half is the slope for this equation. So this particular form

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:13.411
tells us a lot about lines. It tells us the y intercept and it tells us the

00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:13.855
slope.
