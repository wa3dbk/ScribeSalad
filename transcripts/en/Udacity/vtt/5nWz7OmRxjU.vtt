In the second lesson of this course,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.100
you're going to explore the APIs of
some popular online applications.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.370
I will point you to some documentation,
introduce you to a few tools for

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.470
API exploration and testing, and then
you will write code to utilize these

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.030
APIs inside of your own
Python applications.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.840
So let's get started.
