00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.355
So, I hope you remember from the last lecture the concepts of convolution and

00:00:03.355 --> 00:00:05.870
cross-correlation.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.670
We'd looked at in detail, this was how we denote the symbol for

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.440
doing convolution between a kernel and an input image to get an output.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.360
Just related also the convolution method.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.400
The big difference between them is how we loop around the matrix or

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.710
the input image to be able to then assign attributes from the filter.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.000
And basically, using this method,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.050
we can apply various types of filters to process images.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.070
And we actually looked at how we can do this for

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.250
doing noise removal and blurring and smoothing of images.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.660
Of course, you should by now remember that depending on h, if it's symmetric or

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.530
not, you have to choose which one of these to apply.
