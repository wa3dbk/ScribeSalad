00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.550
To illustrate the need for

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.720
malware analysis and
the challenges associated with it,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.990
let's consider one of the common malware
obfuscation techniques, packing.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.120
Packing refers to the process
of compressing and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.680
encrypting part of
an executable program.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.420
The result of packing is that part of
the executable program now becomes data,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.180
instead of an instruction set, and,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.530
in order to execute that part of the
program that has been packed in runtime,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.480
we must reverse it back
from data to insertion set.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.900
That is, we now must include in the
executable program some code that will

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.918
reverse this packing process,
and this is called the unpacking.

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:41.010
To give an illustrated example,
we have the original program,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.745
Program A here, and you see that
the program contains instruction sets.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:49.760
With a packing tool, that includes
compression and encryption and so on.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.720
The result of packing is that
part of the program, meaning,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.430
part of the instruction set,
now becomes data.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.120
We observed that the packing
result looks random,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.950
meaning the data here looks random.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.550
This is because it is encrypted
with a randomly generated key

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.880
each time the packing program
is run on a malware program.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.030
That is, even for
the same malware program, each packed

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.090
instance would look different, and,
therefore, a signature-based approach

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.380
is not effective in detecting
the packed malware.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.290
Now you say this pack
program will include

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.070
code that try to unpack the packed part.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.020
Can we use the unpacking code
as signature to detect malware?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.010
The answer's no.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.070
The reason is that legitimate
programs may also include packing in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.490
order to hide certain logic and data,
for example, for copyright protection.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.580
That is, some legitimate programs
also have unpacking code.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.540
It will unpack some part
of the program in runtime.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.800
Therefore we cannot use the unpacking
code as signature to detect malware.
