Let's try this again. What if we have the polynomial 6 x squared minus 7 x minus

00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:09.133
5? We know that we're going to write this as the product of two linear factors

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.677
and to figure out like we did before what belongs in these different slots, we

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:18.079
need to first find out what the factors of 6 are that could go here, and here,

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.744
and what the factors of negative 5 are. To know what could go here or what could

00:00:22.744 --> 00:00:26.849
go here. So let's do that. For both 6 and negative 5, I'd like you to write out

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.184
all of the pairs of integers that multiply to equal each number. So put one pair

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:35.395
per box. You're not going to fill in all the boxes, just so you know. And write

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.382
the pairs of numbers with just a comma separating them.
