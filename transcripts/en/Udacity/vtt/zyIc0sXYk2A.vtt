00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.910
Let's buildup our linear model for price. I'm

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.210
going to store the first model in a variable called

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.600
m1. You probably also noticed how I used the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.810
I wrapper around each of the variables. The I

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.360
stands for as is. In this case, it tells

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
R to use the expression inside the I function

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.090
to transform a variable before using it in the

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.410
regression. This is instead of instructing R to interpret

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.110
these symbols as part of the formula to construct

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.300
the design matrix for the regression. You can read more

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.810
about the syntax for linear models in the instructor

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.350
notes. I can also update the previous model to add

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.590
the caret variable in the regression, using the syntax.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.870
The real functional relationship is surely not as simple as

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.880
the cubed root of caret, so we add a

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.590
simple linear function of caret in our model predicting price.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.570
And we can continue to make more complex models by

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.940
adding more variables. We add cut even though we don't

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.520
expect it to have much influence on price. Next, we

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.880
add color to a fourth model and clarity to a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.710
fifth. When we run the code, we can see that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.890
we're getting some very nice R square values. We're accounting

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.330
for almost all of the variance in price using the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.706
four Cs. If we want to know whether the price for,

00:01:16.706 --> 00:01:19.590
a diamond is reasonable, we might now use this model.
