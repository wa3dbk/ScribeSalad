00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to my online class on statistics.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The basics of statitics is that the world is full of data,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we the people have to make decisions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Statistics comes to our rescue.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It takes data and turns it into information that we the people can use to make decisions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Whether you are in social sciences, medicine, engineering, public policy,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
psychology, climatology, robotics, even archaeology, health sciences,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
finance, business and marketing, or pretty much any other discipline that you can study.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
All of those are now driven by data, including unlikely fields like biology or physics

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and so many others.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Statistics is an amazing discipline to know.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It is universal, useful, and fun, as I hope you're going to see in the class I'm just about to teach.
