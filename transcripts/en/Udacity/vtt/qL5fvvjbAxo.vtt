00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.670
You've seen several commands, like LS,
Uptime, and cowsay that do something,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.280
and then immediately return
you to the shell prompt.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.500
But not all programs do that.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.888
Some programs are a little
bit more interactive.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.200
They take over the terminal for
as long as they're running, and

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.810
then we get the shell back
when the program exits.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.670
Take, for instance, ping.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.460
Ping let's you test whether another
machine on the internet is alive, and

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.380
how long it takes to send a message
to that machine and back.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.080
Let's see you ping 8.8.8.8,
which is Google's public DNS server.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.860
Very fast and well connected, so
we should always be able to get to it.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.790
Ping starts and it prints out a line for
each successful echo, but

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.570
it doesn't stop on its own and
give you your shell back.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.800
Instead, you have to tell it to stop.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.130
One of the most common ways to
tell a program like this to stop

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.070
is to type Ctrl+C which
sends the interrupt signal.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.860
When you do that, ping stops,
prints out a summary, and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.900
you get your shell prompt back.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.310
But some programs have
a different behavior.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.074
There's a really common design in
Linux programs where a program will

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:08.788
read from what's called standard input,
or stdin and

00:01:08.788 --> 00:01:12.516
write to what's called standard output,
or stdout.

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:15.524
This allows programs to be chained
together on to a pipeline which is

00:01:15.524 --> 00:01:17.990
a little bit beyond
the scope of this course.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.510
When you run a program like
this from the terminal,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.220
it'll read from your keyboard input and
write back to the terminal screen.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.000
And very often when your input is done
you want to send it an end of file

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.995
character which you do by typing Ctrl+D.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.020
Here's an example.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.550
The sort program,
which sorts lines in alphabetical order.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.320
If you run sort and then type or
paste in some text,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.240
it will print those lines out sorted.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.022
But it can't do any sorting until
it's received the last line and

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.920
that's what typing Ctrl+D tells it.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.655
You have to use Ctrl+D instead of
Ctrl+C if you want the sorted output.

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:55.270
Ctrl+C will just cause it to exit.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.090
But there we go, there are the four
lines that I typed in, sorted.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.760
Programs like sort are called line
based programs because they read input

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.590
one line at a time until they
reach the end of the input.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.030
You can usually use them on files as
well as on text that you type in or

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.560
paste into the terminal.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.490
You'll see a few more of
them later in the course.
