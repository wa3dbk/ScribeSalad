00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.950
So the benefits and downsides of
bootstrapping versus investing.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.930
In a bootstrapping scenario
you are in control of

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.820
what you're able to do right now,
without looking anywhere else.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.710
You can immediately take
action this very second.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.436
You can pause this video and go and
take action if you're bootstrapped.

00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:21.447
If you're investing, well, now you
gotta think a little bit more carefully

00:00:21.447 --> 00:00:25.050
how you're going to discuss
what your goals and ideas are.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.930
You need to communicate very clearly
what it is you want, what it is you're

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.328
doing, and why this person or group of
people should give you money to do it.

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:36.166
On the flip-side,
negative aspects of bootstrapping are,

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.335
if you are sitting in a room
that has nothing in it and

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:43.863
your arms are tied behind your back,
your bootstrapping round is over.

00:00:43.863 --> 00:00:46.105
[LAUGH] And
there's very little you can actually do.

00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:49.735
And if you find yourself in a situation
where there really isn't anything that

00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:52.760
you have at your disposal that
can help you bootstrap something,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.710
you're kind of stuck.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.844
And that's where investment
can really be a lifesaver.

00:00:56.844 --> 00:01:00.387
Because you can reach out to somebody,
or a group of people for help,

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:04.113
who might have the resources for that
key element you need to do that thing

00:01:04.113 --> 00:01:07.010
that will make your business
successful in this space.
