00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.235
So, how did you do on your first absolute value inequality? Did you get negative

00:00:04.247 --> 00:00:08.148
7 to 9? If so, great work. Let's see how we got that answer. When I see an

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.709
absolute value with a less than, I know that we're going to have an

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:15.801
intersection, which is going to leave us one region. To solve this absolute

00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:21.557
value inequality, I can set it up as a compound inequality. Negative 2 is less

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:27.842
than or equal to x minus 1 over 4, which is less than or equal to 2. So, here's

00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:34.198
our two cases. We have negative 2 is less than or equal to x minus 1 over 4 and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.005
we have x minus 1 over 4 is less than or equal to 2. We can solve this compound

00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:43.485
inequality all at one time. First thing I want to do is clear my fraction. To

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:48.010
clear my fraction, I'm going to multiply through by the least common denominator

00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:52.295
which is 4. When I multiply through by 4, I have to multiply 4 by negative 2

00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:57.471
which gives me negative 8. And I multiply 4 by x minus 1 over 4, which gives me

00:00:57.483 --> 00:01:02.965
x minus 1. And I have to multiply 4 times 2, which is 8. The next thing I need

00:01:02.977 --> 00:01:09.432
to do is isolate the x in the middle, so I have to add 1 to all three parts, and

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:15.865
I get negative 7 is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to 9.

00:01:15.877 --> 00:01:21.634
And I can draw this on a number line. If this is 0 and this is 9 and this is

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:27.604
negative 7, we know that x has to be greater than or equal to negative 7 and x

00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:33.705
has to be less than or equal to 9. So, I fill in the region in the middle. And

00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:39.410
that gives me the interval from negative 7 to 9 with closed brackets. Remember,

00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:44.812
we use closed brackets when we have less than or equal to or greater than or

00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:47.119
equal to. Let's try another one.
