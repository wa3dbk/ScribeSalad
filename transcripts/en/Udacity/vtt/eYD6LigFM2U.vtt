00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.380
Now, one thing I'll be doing throughout all my lessons,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.410
is I'm going to start off each lesson with a list of objectives for that lesson.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.320
And then we'll try to see if we can match and

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.420
have you learn about those specific things in that specific lesson.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.010
The four specific objectives for this lesson are, is one again, for

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.260
you to start thinking about a digital image and look at representations of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.440
an image with, in terms of pixels, and at the resolution of that image.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.850
I will cover basics of how we would actually represent that image as in

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.479
a discrete form using a matrix, or in a continuous form as a function.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.630
We will be looking at the other foundations of grayscale and color images.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.640
And I'll also be touching on how digital images and the file formats and

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.940
stuff like that are used.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.850
What is actually in those files that you've gotten used to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.560
seeing on your cameras and your computers?
