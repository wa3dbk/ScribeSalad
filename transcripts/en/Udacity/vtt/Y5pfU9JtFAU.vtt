00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.576
So, I saw more people fights
with their co-founders and

00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:09.336
breaking up with their co-founders.

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:14.090
Then I saw people were sticking
with their co-founders for years.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.070
I think that one of the most popular
reason, one of the most common reasons,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.260
that the companies fail is because
the co-founders fights and

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.030
they can't work together for
a long time.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.050
It happens mainly because I
think there's two main reasons.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.390
The first reason is
the definition of working hard.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020
Sometime the values of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.270
one co-founder is very different
than the values of the other one.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.400
If I believe that working hard
is working 18 hours a day, and

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.580
not taking vacation, and not taking
salaries, but my co-founder's values say

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.580
that it's working 9 to 5 but working
really hard, that sometimes collide.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.185
You follow values that our
employees should be doing

00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:07.535
120% and they need to stick to doing all
nighters and we need to ship of the day,

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:10.270
and the other one thinks that
it should be more mellow.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.990
It's probably going to break some time.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.190
Another reason is not being
sure what everybody's role is.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.230
So we decided that you're the CEO but
I'm going to be involved in everything

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.320
that you're going to decide even
though that my definition is the CMO.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.880
This is also not going to work.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.340
And if the CEO decides to micromanage
his cofounder This is also going to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.810
break, and those reasons are, I think,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.250
the main reasons that the companies
fail because of founders.
