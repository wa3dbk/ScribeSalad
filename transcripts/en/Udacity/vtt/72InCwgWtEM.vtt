00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.875
Egocentric thinking is the inability to look at the world through somebody

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:07.814
else's perspective. Piaget came up with a very clever test to measure this,

00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:12.316
called the Three Mountain Test. Here, he would have a child sit and look at

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:15.610
these three mountains and tell him from direction of left to right what he

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.796
says. So, from your perspective the child would see a blue top mountain, a

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:25.680
plane mountain and a red top mountain. Next, you would ask a child what

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.664
somebody in my position would see. Inevitably the child would say, I would see

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.958
the same thing, meaning a blue top mountain, a plain mountain and a red top

00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:39.310
mountain. However, as you can see my perspective, I actually would see a red

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.292
top mountain, a plain mountain and a blue top mountain. Again, egocentric

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:48.568
thinking is an inability of the child to take himself out of his own skin, and

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:52.270
look at the world from somebody else's perspective.
