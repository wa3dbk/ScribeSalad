The specific lesson objectives for this lesson are,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.580
I'm going to talk a lot more about the concept of focal length, we will and

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.260
then discuss the whole issues of how the field of view of a camera, or

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.170
a imaging sensor are related to focal length.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.220
We will also discuss the importance of, the sensor size for each camera, and

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.590
we will look in detail at the whole image formation pipeline and

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.110
how images are captured and discuss the basics of perspective projection,

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.140
that is important in trying to capturing the 3D aspect of a scene.
