00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.040
To illustrate concepts with relational databases, we're going to use some data

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.805
on the Aadhaar program, that is acquired from India's online Open Data Portal.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:11.730
Aadhaar is a relatively, new initiative in India.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.930
It is a 12 digit, unique number that,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.310
enables identification for every resident of India.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.020
According, to the Indian government.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.780
Once instituted, the Aadhaar will provide a universal identity infrastructure,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.130
which can be used by any identity-based application.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.710
The dataset, we'll be using describes the number of people, who enrolled in or

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.970
were rejected by the Aadhaar program.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.620
Cut by various characteristics, such as district, subdistrict, gender, and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.870
age across India.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.510
As data scientists, the Aadhaar program is interesting to us, because it is

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.710
a huge dataset, representing one of the most significant populations on Earth.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.610
We can study the Aadhaar enrollment dataset to learn a bit more about

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.900
India's population.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.650
And also, what type of people are applying for and

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.680
successfully enrolling in the Aadhaar program.
