00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.210
Now that we've defined NP, and

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.530
defined what it means to be
verifiable in polynomial time,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.790
I want you to apply this knowledge to
decide if several problems are in NP.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.990
First, is a given graph connected?

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:18.075
Second, does a graph have a set of
K vertices with no edges between?

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:19.705
This is called
the independent set problem.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:24.385
And lastly, will a Turing Machine
accept exactly one string?
