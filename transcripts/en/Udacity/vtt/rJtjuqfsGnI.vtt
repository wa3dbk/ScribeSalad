00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.470
Cache the network is ideal for
data that is updated frequently or

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.030
when it's important to get data
on-screen as quickly as possible.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.324
Like the fastest strategy,
two parallel requests are made,

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:18.840
one to the cache and one to the network.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.310
The idea is to show
the cached data first,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.800
then update the cache and
the page when the network data arrives.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.900
Take care not to squash the latest data
if the network returns before the cache.
