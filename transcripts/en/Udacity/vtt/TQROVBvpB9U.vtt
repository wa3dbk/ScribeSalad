I know this has seemed pretty easy so far, but there's something else that's

00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:08.889
really interesting about 1/4. I can represent 1/4 in other ways. Like if I had a

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:13.257
clock. So, if I start on the hour, I could go 15 minutes. I could go another 15

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.873
minutes, I could go another 15 minutes, and I could go another 15. I know an

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:23.790
hour is 60 minutes so I just need to go 1/4 of that way. So, 1/4 is going to be

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:29.666
one 15-minute period. This is 1/4 of my one hour. 1/4 could also represent part

00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:35.433
of an area of a square. Here's a square, notice that I split the square up into

00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:40.865
4 parts. If I shade one of those parts, I have 1 out of 4 or 1/4. Notice that in

00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:45.035
both cases, I split up my whole part into 4 equal pieces. I split the square up

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:48.975
into 4 equal pieces and I split my hour up into 4 15-minute time intervals.

00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:53.345
What's really important is that we always create equally sized pieces. What's

00:00:53.357 --> 00:00:57.175
also interesting is that I could have actually split up my square a bit

00:00:57.187 --> 00:01:02.234
differently, I could have drawn this. So, if I shaded in this area, I know that

00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:06.035
I'd have 1/4 or 1 out of 4 equally divided pieces.
