00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.900
Notice that we start with all the countries initially on the map and then

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.190
go year to year plotting the game of the World Cup as it changes host country.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.270
And only showing the countries that were involved in that World Cup for

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.620
the given year.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.760
So this is going through every year of the World Cup, in which there are twenty,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.970
and plotting the home country's attendance numbers as an orange circle.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750
And every other participating country in the World Cup for

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.520
a given year is shown in light blue.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.380
If the country did not participate in a given year of the World Cup,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.350
this year being 2014, since it was the last World Cup, we simply make it white.
