Yeah, one of my big advice big pieces of advice that I'd give for someone

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.654
learning how to program is, it's okay to look stupid like, it's okay not to

00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:12.256
know what you're doing. Like it's, it's funny one of my big things going into

00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:15.784
like, learning how to program was I had pride issues, where I was like I don't

00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:21.327
want to look dumb, I don't want to ask for help. And asking for help like,

00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:24.241
whether it's, you know, Googling it like Googling is my best friend when it

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.249
comes to things that I don't know or you know, even just asking someone next to

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:32.052
me. Like hey can you look over this code or forums like, there's so many

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:36.579
things, so many resources out there that are available. And you know, everyone

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.895
in constantly learning, that's the thing, is that like. For me like, looking

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:44.360
back the people that I was asking now that I know like what year they were when

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.193
I was asking its like, wow they are where I am now. And they were still

00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:53.630
learning cause I'm still learning and so just knowing that its like its okay.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.392
People you're always going to have someone that's like oh you're new but that's

00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:00.057
OK you have to start somewhere.
