00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.660
We've talked about potential places
where your app can really shine and

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.470
where it can really fail.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.680
Being on the development team of an app
can lead to a certain type of blindness.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.860
You know the app so

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.960
well that you naturally miss some of the
pain points a new user might run into.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.920
This is where bringing in external
feedback can be extremely helpful.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.850
As soon as you publish your app, or even
beforehand, when showing it to testers,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.020
you get a flood of advice.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.620
This feedback can be a great
source of new perspectives and

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.900
give you insight into exactly how
people are using your app, or

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.580
even better,
how they want to use your app.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.620
Having a large,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.040
diverse set of users can be one of
the keys to building a successful app.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880
Remember, that while feedback from
others who have built Android

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.980
apps can be helpful, it shouldn't
be your only source of feedback.
