00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.431
We're going to have 4 items that we're going to try to hash into this giant cuckoo hash table,

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.716
and the cuckoo hash table has 2 sub tables, t1 and t2,

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:14.645
and so each one of those 2 sub tables has 2 slots

00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:21.066
corresponding to h1 equals 0, h1 equals 1, h2 equals 0, h2 equals 1.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:25.770
Now we have 4 items that we are going to try to hash into this big cuckoo hash table.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.047
And so, I've already computed their hash functions.

00:00:29.047 --> 00:00:35.480
So item A, for instance--it's h sub 1 of its particular key is 1,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.827
and h sub 2 is equal to 1, and so on.

00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:39.849
So you can see all these hash functions here.

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:41.913
So let's do round 1. What do we do on round 1?

00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:46.881
What we try to do is place all of the alive items, and we start off with all the items being alive,

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:51.255
and we're trying to place them all into t1 using this hash function.

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:56.720
So now we see that items A and C both would like to map into this bucket,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.312
and items B and D, because of their values of h1, would like to map into this bucket.

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:06.346
Now we can only fit 1 item per bucket, so we're going to arbitrarily pick a couple of items to win.

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:09.724
Okay, so I'll arbitrarily pick that C and D happen to win here.

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:14.346
D is written into hash bucket number 0, and C is written into hash bucket number 1.

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:16.893
Cool, and so A and B are still alive.

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:19.390
And now, we'll move to the next iteration of the algorithm,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.515
and we'll use h sub 2 to try to map A and B into table 2,

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:28.432
and we see, well, both of these guys would like to map into this same bucket.

00:01:28.432 --> 00:01:31.944
So again, they're both going to try; only 1 of them is going to succeed.

00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:34.979
For the purposes of argument, I'm going to say that's going to B.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.494
Okay, so now we still have the element A left after both rounds, so here's the neat part.

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:45.075
We now go back to table 1, and we know that if we hash item A,

00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:48.353
it's going to collide with an item already stored in the hash table.

00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:50.678
We know that because it didn't succeed the first time.

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:53.283
So we're going to try to hash it again,

00:01:53.283 --> 00:01:58.179
but now when it collides with an item that's already in the hash table, here's the different part.

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.258
We're going to take A and place it into the hash table,

00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:05.061
and we're going to kick out the item that's already there, and continue.

00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.002
And now we continue on the next iteration of the algorithm again.

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:11.336
We see that the only item that's left alive is now C.

00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:14.804
We see that its value of h2 is 0,

00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:18.842
so we can safely place C into the hash table here, and we're done.

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:24.069
So the big picture here is that by kicking out things that are already in the hash table,

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.643
we have a new set of items to try to continue to place in the hash table,

00:02:27.643 --> 00:02:32.188
and maybe they'll fit better than the old set, and we continue to apply this procedure.

00:02:32.188 --> 00:02:38.192
On each iteration, we always try to place our outstanding items into the next sub table of the hash table,

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:42.871
and if they succeed, they kick out the items already there until we have no more items left.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.871
Now, will this always succeed? Yes or no?
