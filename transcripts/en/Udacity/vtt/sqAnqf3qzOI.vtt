00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.960
Let's delve in a little bit to
the some of the things that

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.260
we've said in the last couple of slides.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.400
So I brought back the options
that we had before and

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.860
the little pictures and I erased a bunch
of stuff and then I made a change.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.710
Do you see the change?

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.410
&gt;&gt; You got rid of the word, yes, I was
going to say you got rid of the word

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.630
options but you actually changed
the word state into goal.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.290
&gt;&gt; Well that wasn't what it
used to say in the title,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.400
it didn't say state abstraction,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.660
although I did write state
abstraction at some point.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.960
&gt;&gt; It had temporal extraction.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.400
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; So what I want to point out,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.630
you asked the question when before we
did the quiz, you said, well, wait,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.680
are these things all
happening at the same time or

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.910
are they happening like,
how does this work?

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.710
Well, you touched on something kind of
neat there, right, which is We have

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.410
talked about so
far this kind of options things if well,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.990
as if they're just primitive actions,
right?

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.450
You take one and
you take the other and take the other.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.210
In other words we've
talked about sequencing.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.250
And that's perfectly reasonable and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.990
that's really what we've
been talking about and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.080
everything that we've
talked about in this class.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.990
But when you ask whether the things
could be running to the same time or

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.870
whether we're trying to
accomplish all these at once,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.240
we're really talking about something
different, which is goals.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.080
So I'm going to claim that although
we've been focusing on sequencing,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.060
which makes sense, right?

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.860
We're talking about sequential
decision processes, right?

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.740
That's the whole point
of what we're doing.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.130
You could think about these
things as running in parallel.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.680
Although we talk about, well first
we're going to take the option of go to

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.260
the east door, and then I'm going to
execute the option go to the south door,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.090
and then I'm going to go down,
down left or whatever I'm going to do.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.900
You could conceptualize this as actually

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.360
all the options are running
at the same time.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.500
So, I am always trying to go to the east
door, the south door, the other

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.390
south door, the other east door, and any
given time, one of them is in control.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.550
I mean conceptually that's no different,
really, right?

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.190
&gt;&gt; So, maybe, I mean I guess it
sounds like what you're describing is

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.680
a little bit like a,
like a call stack in computer languages.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.880
The idea that sure
while we're going after

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.389
that first goal of getting to
the east door in the north east room.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.070
You know in the back of our mind just
the idea that we're; the reason we're

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.680
doing that is so
that we can do these other goals next.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.800
&gt;&gt; No I actually mean something
a little bit different.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.060
So, imagine I had a bunch of things
running in parallel, imagine we

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.560
had a thing called a computer right, and
the computer did many things at once.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.130
So it was recording,
it was printing, it was

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.670
letting some program compile in the
background while the user was editing.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.340
&gt;From the computer's point of view,
right, the way we think about

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.480
these things is these things are all
sort of running at the same time.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.300
But at least from with respect
to any individual processor,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.930
only one thing can be
happening at the same time.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.220
So we can write down everything as
if it's happening in sequence, but

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.190
in some sense it's happening in
parallel or they're all fighting for

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.610
resources at the same time.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.098
But only one of them can be in
control at any given point in time.

00:02:57.098 --> 00:03:00.270
So, even though the world is sequential,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.800
we think about executing an option
then executing another option.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.630
A kind of, it's a reason way of
thinking about the world but

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.300
there's another kind of conceit
one could take which is

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.220
all of these things want to run they
all want to happen at the same time.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.440
They're constantly saying take me,
take me, take me.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.040
I want to have control of the mouse,
or I want to control the screen or

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.320
whatever, and
we're just choosing which one to let go.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.970
So they're still running at the same
time they're just not in control at

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.700
the same time in aren't
able to do anything.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.730
Once you do that,
you end up thinking, or

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.270
you can end up thinking about of this
problem of temporal abstraction is not

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.600
one of sequencing things directly but
as one of managing competing goals.
