00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.350
Let's now look at the first design pattern that we

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.700
will discuss, the factory method pattern. And I'm going to start

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.220
by discussing the intent of the pattern and its applicability.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.210
As far as the intent is concerned, the factory method pattern

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.690
allows for creating objects without specifying their class, by invoking

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.370
what we call a factory method. And what that is, is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.680
a method whose main goal is to create class instances.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.510
So when is this pattern useful? So when is it applicable?

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.080
For example, it is applicable in cases in which a class

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.890
cannot anticipate the type of object it must create. That is,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.800
the type of an object is not known at compile time,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
is not known until the code runs. A typical example of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.500
this, are frameworks. So if you ever used a framework, you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.280
will know that, normally, frameworks only know about interfaces and abstract

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.450
classes. So the exact type of the objects of these classes

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.840
is only known at runtime. The second case in which the factory

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.835
method pattern is applicable, is when a class wants its

00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:57.160
subclasses to specify the type of objects it creates. And we'll

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.920
see an example of this in a minute. Finally, factory

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.580
method patterns are applicable when a class needs control over the

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.760
creation of its objects. And in this case, one possible

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.380
example is when there is a limit on the number of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.930
objects that can be created. Special example, it's a singleton. If

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.840
you're familiar with a singleton, a singleton is a class for

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.930
which only one instance can be created. The factory method pattern

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.760
is perfect in these cases, because it allows to control how many

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.640
objects get created. So in this case, it would allow the creation

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.290
only of a single object. And from the second time that it

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.040
is invoked, it will just return the object that was previously

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.700
created. Now let's go ahead and see how this pattern actually works,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.100
and let's do that by discussing the structure and the participants for

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.330
the pattern. The structure that is represented here, using the UML notation,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.530
includes three classes, the Creator, the ConcreteCreator,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.000
and the Product. The Creator provides the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.710
interface for the factory method. So this

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.200
here, is the interface for the factory method

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.950
that, when invoked, returns an object of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.440
type Product. The ConcreteCreator provides the actual

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.350
method for creating the Product. So this

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.170
method is a concrete implementation of this interface.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.630
Finally, the Product is the object created by the factory method. So

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.350
summarizing, we have the interface for

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.300
the factory method, the actual implementation of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.540
the summary method, and the object that is created by the factory method,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.020
when it is invoked. So let's look at an example of this pattern.
