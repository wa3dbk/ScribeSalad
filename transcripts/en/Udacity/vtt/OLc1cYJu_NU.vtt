Hi, I'm Peter Chapman.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Last semester I TA'd for CS101 where we built the search engine.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This time around, we're going to build a web browser

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
using the power of programming languages in CS262.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
When I'm not working on my start-up search engine, searchwithpeter.info--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you should check it out--I'm going to be helping you with homework answers

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and answering questions in the forums,

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so I'll see you in class.
