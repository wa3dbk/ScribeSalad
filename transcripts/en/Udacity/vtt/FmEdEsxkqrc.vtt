00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.450
Different dependencies may be needed at
different times in the build process.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.090
Logically related dependencies
are grouped into configurations.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.850
So far, we've be adding dependencies
to the compile configuration.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.250
But the Java plugin creates
other configurations as well,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.730
such as runtime, test compile,
and test runtime.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.870
The Java plugin ensures that the
specified dependencies are on the class

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.690
path when the corresponding
tasks are run.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.090
Dependencies can be added to any of
these configurations by simply using

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.820
the name of the configuration
followed by the dependency notation.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.880
Here we have an added dependency
to the test compile configuration.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.170
This dependency will only be
available from our test code.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.340
Configurations can extend
to other configurations.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.310
For example, test compile extends
from the compiled configuration.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.440
Which means that all of the dependencies
in the compile configuration

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.300
are automatically
included in test compile.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.730
We can verify this by
generating a dependency report.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.160
Here we see that the compile
configuration contains a dependency on

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.480
commons logging.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.870
But the test compile configuration
contains both the dependency on commons

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.130
logging and on JUnit, and
on one of its transitive dependencies.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.050
If you have a more advanced build
with dependencies that don't fit

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.880
into a configuration
defined by the Java plugin.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.310
You can create a custom configuration.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.970
Just add the name of your configuration
to the configuration script block,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.170
we can then assign dependencies
to that custom configuration.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.370
We can now run a dependency report
to see the new dependencies

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.710
added to the Project.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.830
And if we scroll up we find
our custom configuration

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.840
along with the dependency we declared.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.400
Under the hood configurations
are really just fancy file collections.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.420
And can be used anywhere a file
collection can be used such as in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.960
a copy task.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.300
This is useful if we want to download
some dependencies from a remote

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.360
repository and
bundle them in our project somehow.
