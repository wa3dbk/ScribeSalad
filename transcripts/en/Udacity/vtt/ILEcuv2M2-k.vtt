00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.212
In the past few minutes we've touched on a
lot of concepts that are going to play a

00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:08.007
really central role in the rest of the
course and really in all math going

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.194
forwards from here. So I would like to do
a review of the algebra vocabulary that

00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:16.046
we've covered so far. I think it's
actually going to amaze you how much we've

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:20.258
already gone over in a pretty short amount
of time. So first thing first, we have

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.800
numbers, as one might expect in math. So
what are some examples of numbers? Well,

00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:29.215
we could have any number of things. So
like we learned in the very beginning of

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:33.738
this course, they're all different kinds
of numbers. Some that are pretty simple

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.253
and we use all the time, like 0 or 1 or
46, and some that are a little bit more

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:43.084
special, like the root of 2 or pi. Then in
contrast to numbers, we also learned about

00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:48.125
variables. So, here we have all different
kinds of symbols, we have some letters, we

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:50.857
have some sillier things like hearts and
smiley faces, we got some greek letters.

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:55.919
But regardless of what we write variables
as they all have the same purpose, as we

00:00:55.931 --> 00:01:00.528
learned earlier. Variables are symbols
that we use in equations and expressions

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.562
that serve as slots into which we can plug
other numbers to make our expressions take

00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:09.959
on different values. So comparing numbers
and variables, numbers have fixed values.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:14.413
They inherently show certain quantities.
Variables, however, don't show outright

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:18.721
what they stand for, they're just place
holders into which we can insert different

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.655
numbers. One thing to take note of when
we're looking at what's inside each of

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:27.479
these circles is that we actually have a
symbol on the number side. That's this pi

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:31.773
right here. Since pi is an irrational
number, it extends for an infinite number

00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:35.822
of decimal points. Now, it took me an
awfully long time to write all of this

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:40.123
out. So if I were to write even more, that
would take me even longer. To make our

00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:44.131
lives much more simple, we give this
infinitely long number a special name,

00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:48.869
which is pi. A similar thing happens when
we write square roots. We have a number,

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.451
2, right here but we also have a square
root sign over it. Since the root of 2 is

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:57.858
also an irrational number the square root
sign is just another way of taking a

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.139
shortcut to not have to write out an
infinite number of decimals. So bottom

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.798
line, when you see symbols, they're almost
always variables. They'll be certain

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.783
cases. Which you'll become well acquainted
with when you see things like pi or like a

00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:15.189
square root sign that are symbols of some
sort but represent numbers.
