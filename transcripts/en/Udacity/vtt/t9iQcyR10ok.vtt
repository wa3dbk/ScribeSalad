Now what can we do with this equation? Well, we can find out how Grant's monthly

00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:08.791
expenses change when he produces a different number of wiper sets. By plugging

00:00:08.803 --> 00:00:13.109
in values of x, and then solving for y. But remember, I'm really lazy, and that

00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:17.208
would take a lot of time and effort. There has to be a better way. As we saw

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.755
earlier, representing the data or an equation so we can just see the answer is a

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:25.855
great way to have a ton of x and y values right in front of our eyes. So, which

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:30.140
of these four graphs do you think might correctly represent this equation that

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:34.140
we just came up with? This is only the very beginning of our discussion of

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:35.695
graphs, so just take a guess.
