00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.220
We'll make the next step
in the proof an exercise.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.760
If (u,v) goes from A to B,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.470
what does that tell us about
the values of the flow?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.790
And similarly,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.110
if (u,v) goes from B to A what does that
tell us about the values of the flow?
