00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.810
In the real world, things don't just
appear or disappear out of thin air.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.440
They move into place.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.510
Instantaneous changes can be
confusing or disorienting.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.510
&gt;&gt; Just as we learned how applying
lessons from the physical world to

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.990
create tangible surfaces in our UI
helps to convey information about them.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.490
Applying real world principles
of motion can make your

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.530
interface more understandable.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.760
&gt;&gt; Think of your user interface
as existing on a shared stage.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.170
Elements move in and out of this
stage in a controlled manner.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.820
&gt;&gt; Right, in this lesson we'll look at
how you can use motion to create a more

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.330
continuous experience, how we can teach
your users about using your UI and

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.280
how we can also provide
moments of delight.
