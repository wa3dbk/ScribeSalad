00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.300
Since we're trying to find the roots of this equation, we need to set y equal to

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.504
0. Remember that the roots of the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts, which is

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:12.794
where y equals 0. Now, let's use the quadratic formula to solve this. Plugging

00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:17.486
the proper coefficients into the proper spots in the quadratic formula, gives us

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:21.764
x equals negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 2 squared minus 4 times 1

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:26.616
times 10, all over 2. Let's simplify. Well, this is getting pretty interesting.

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:31.315
Look at what I have underneath my square root sign. We end up with negative 2

00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:36.091
plus or minus the square root of negative 36 over 2. This is pretty shocking.

00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:41.175
This problem is asking us to take the square root of a negative number. We can't

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:45.339
do that. We do not have any idea what real number this would equal. In fact,

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.774
there is no real number that this equals. So, what does this mean? No solutions?

00:00:49.774 --> 00:00:53.995
No crossing in the x-axis? Well, we found a solution. Let's take a peek at the

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:58.194
graph. So, here's the graph of y equals x squared plus 2x plus 10. Remember,

00:00:58.194 --> 00:01:02.029
when we were looking for roots, we're looking for the x-coordinates of

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:06.825
x-intercepts of the graph. But look at were our vertex is, it's right here way

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:11.703
above the x-axis and our parabola is point upward. Coming to the y-coordinate at

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:16.382
this point right here is the smallest y-coordinate of any point on this graph.

00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:20.990
In other words, because this is the minimum point, the graph is never going to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.499
get any closer to the x-axis, and so it's never going to touch it at all. This

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:29.953
is pretty fascinating. The weird thing is that we still got some sort of answer.

00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:34.276
You'll have to wait for the next lesson though, to find out what this means.
