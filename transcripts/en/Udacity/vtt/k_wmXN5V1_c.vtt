00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.500
If you look back to the very first moment that you wrote code in this lesson,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.770
you'll notice that you've been following a very simple pattern of code,

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.810
test and refine.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.180
You'll write some code, test and see how it looks against the design mockup that

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.220
you received and then make any refinements or

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.130
modifications to the code so that it looks closer to the design.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.780
And you'll repeat this process of testing and

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.780
modifying until it looks like the design you were given.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.400
But, how do you know where to start testing?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.650
And then how do you also know what to refine so

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.170
that it looks closer to the design?

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.520
First, you need to get the structure of the page right.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.410
You should be able to do that from the design, by visually boxifying it.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.840
Then move on to work on the tags.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.270
If something needs to be a heading, make it so.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.590
Then think about the size of the boxes.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.290
How big should they be?

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.810
And then, how to position them where you want on the screen.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.239
Once the general layout is complete, the time has come for

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.540
smaller details, and these you can polish until the page looks exactly like

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.700
the design image you were given.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.270
So, to summarize, first, make sure to divide and conquer.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270
Look for places that are distinct.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.130
Everything on the Web is a box, so look for the natural boxes.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.075
Then look for repeated styles and semantic elements.

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:32.500
H2 should be the second biggest headings on the page and things like that.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.620
Think about how you can relate this to HTML elements,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.290
then write your HTML, then apply your styles.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.150
Go from your biggest site-wide elements to your smallest like widgets.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.200
Then fix the small things.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.380
Look at your site in other browsers, resize your window, and just keep repeating

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.095
steps 3 and 4 until you're happy and your website looks like the design mockup.
