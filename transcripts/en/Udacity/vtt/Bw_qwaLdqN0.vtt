The fifth section is titled variables. Design studies themselves have to

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.900
be designed. In particular the independent and dependent variables must be

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.270
identified and appropriate metrics specified. Design studies,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.970
like experiments, allow designers, like scientists, to alter conditions and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.620
note results. The altered conditions comprise the independent variables. And

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.500
the corresponding results comprise the dependent variables each variable has

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.870
a unique name a description and a unit of measurement such as seconds. Sometimes

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.900
the units are easy for example time other variable such as maintainability

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.893
require you to think carefully and invent an appropriate way to measure it. But

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:43.364
this section of the design study describes the variables, both independent and

00:00:43.364 --> 00:00:47.640
dependent, the units and measures, and how the research questions address them.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.810
The section should also include a summary table, with three columns, which for

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.190
each research question, lists the independent and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.880
dependent variables you used, in answering the question.
