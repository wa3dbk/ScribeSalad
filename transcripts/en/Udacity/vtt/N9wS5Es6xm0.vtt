00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.098
So this problem may or may not have thrown
you off a little bit, because as we can

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.210
count, there are 3 terms inside these
parentheses and in the problems we've done

00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:12.226
before. And in the rule that I wrote up
here you only saw 2 terms added together.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.648
However it does not matter how many terms
are inside a parentheses a multiplication

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.276
is still going to distribute to every
single one of them. So in this case the 3

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:27.575
is going to multiply the x^2 and also the
5x and also the -7. So let's write that

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:34.081
out. So distributing 3 to each of these
terms, we get 3x^2+3(5x)+3(-7), and then

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:38.893
we can simply within each term. And we get
a final answer of 3x^2+15x-21.
