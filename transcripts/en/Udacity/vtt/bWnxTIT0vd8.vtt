00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay. A little bit more. I'm going to add a bonus problem to this final.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is not required but if you do it you'll be eligible for a higher level of distinction in the class,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and again we'll enumerate all that in the instructor comments.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This bonus problem, and you may have seen this link in the demo I gave,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is to add a page history to each page.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This history link--implement this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
When we click this history link, the URL changes to _history and then URL.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In this case, we're going to front page it with a slash

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and you can see all the previous versions of a page.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Remember, in the original demo of the problem, I just had it say, "Welcome to the Final"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and then I edited the page to say, "Your task is to build a wiki."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm just including the first 100 characters or so of a page.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I can click on view of either of these links to view older versions of a page.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is the most recent version. If I want to edit a page, I can still click edit.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Notice how the URL changes to _edit.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If I add this other statement and I click save, you can see the page is updated.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And if I were to click on history, you can see that there's a new version at the top here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This might be a little tricky.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But for those of you who can figure it out, this will be a really good exercise.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's go back to that other URL we are looking at before--new page.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This was a page we added in the first part of the assignment.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If I were to click history on this page, we can see that this also has two versions.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The original version I made--Here's a new page--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and then the other version that had some HTML in it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now you can see here of course in the history page, the HTML is escaped,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and when we view the HTML is unescaped causing it to behave exactly like HTML.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We are not going to test on that because it's up to you to decide on your wiki

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
whether or not you want to trust your users not to put a bunch of garbage on your page or not.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You know that's a decision you can make as a website owner, and we won't grill you on it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But of course in editing, the text area form should escape things properly if they're in there.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so it can be edited properly, and that's all we've got.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
When you have that working, submit your URL here and good luck.
