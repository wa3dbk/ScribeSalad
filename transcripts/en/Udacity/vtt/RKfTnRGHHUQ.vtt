If you're a little bit test-wise, you should be able to guess this even if you don't understand why.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The answer is this, but let me explain why.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What we'd like to show is that if we're given a function f(n) that is in Θ(g(n))

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that we can turn that around and also infer that that means g(n) is in Θ(f(n)).

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The way we're going to show this is to go back to the definition of Big Theta.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here's the definition--that there is some constant c₁ and c₂ bigger than 0

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and a a threshold n₀ such that f(n) lies between c₁ of g(n) and c₂ of g(n) for all n

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
bigger than the threshold n₀.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We can infer from this that by dividing through this equation dividing through by c₁,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which is a positive number, we get a new set of inequalities--like so--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
where g(n) is now sandwiched between 1/c₁ of f(n) and 0.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We can do that same trick again dividing through this equation by c₂.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We see that 1/c₂ of f(n) is less than or equal to g(n).

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We can combine these two facts to show that g(n) is sandwiched between

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
1/c₂ of f(n) and 1/c₁ of f(n)--like so.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Notice that this1/c₂ and 1/c₁--those are just constants.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It equivalent to say that this 1/c₂ is just a constant, and we can rename it c₁,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and this one 1/c₁ is just a constant and we can rename it c₂,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and this is exactly the definition of Big Theta,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so we can infer from this that g(n) is in Θ(f(n)).
