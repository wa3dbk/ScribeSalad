00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here is my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I created a new data structure called sdata,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and I get it by sorting it using the sorted command applied to data.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So that's Python notation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you've never programmed before,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
get the notation by saying we get this thing data,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we run it through the sorter, out comes something new,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we assign it to the left side over here--this new thing called sdata.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I can just make these things up.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And then I ask myself, "What's the right index?"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So if sdata is of length 5, the index I want is not number 3, but number 2

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
because the indexing starts at zero.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So say len(data) returns 5.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I subtract 1. It gives me 4.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I divide the 4 by 2.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That gives me the index number 2, and that works for any data length.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So if I had 7, for example, 7 minus 1 is 6.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Divided by 2 is 3. It always gives me the middle element.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And then we just return with this indexing over here the center element.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This return with this command over here,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the element of the sorted list that's right in the middle.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And that returns the median.

00:01:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So if I hit the run button, I get back 2.
