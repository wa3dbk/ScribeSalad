00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.160
That was a trick question. We wanted to

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.240
emphasize that affordances and signifiers are quite different

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.530
concepts. They're independent. Affordances are the possible actions

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.270
an actor can take upon an item in question.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.610
Signifiers are the signal. Signal conveyed to the

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.710
person about the possible actions. Something can be

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.930
in affordance or a signifier or both or

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.790
neither. It could even be a signifier of something

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.520
but not afford doing it. The correct

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.300
answers to the questions therefore are, the barbed

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.850
wire. Yeah, the barbs on the barbed wire,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.270
they're both signifiers and anti-affordances. The danger sign,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.700
yeah, that's a signifier. The site of the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.530
high voltage line? Well, that's a signifier to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
some people, but meaningless to others. And a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.660
very high voltage itself is an invisible affordance.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.285
It doesn't afford getting near. You'll kill yourself,

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:56.560
because within, but for a high voltage, if

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.080
you're within one meter about three feet, it

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.070
can be fatal. But there's nothing to see. It's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.410
invisible, so the very high voltage is actually

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.470
at invisible anti-affordance. The doorknob. It's a partial

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.930
signifier and an affordance. The signifier is only

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.960
partial because it indicates where to do the action,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.780
you know, pushing, or pulling, or turning, but not which action to do.
