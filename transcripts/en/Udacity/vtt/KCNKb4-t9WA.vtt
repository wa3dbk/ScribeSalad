00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.969
Historically, we'd probably use an associative array or a hash table

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.320
to solve this problem in a traditional computing environment. The location

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.080
would be the key and the sales for that store, the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.770
value. Then we'd process the input file one line at a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.990
time, adding each store as a key. What problems do you

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.000
see with this approach? Say if you were running it on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.620
one terabyte of data. Do you think that it flat out

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.470
won't work? Or could you run out of memory having to store

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.050
this hash table. Could it take an excessively long

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.450
time? Or will we not get the right answer?
