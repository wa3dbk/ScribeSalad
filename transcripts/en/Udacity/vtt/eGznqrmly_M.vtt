00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.939
Let's do another calculation with the Day object. Astronaut Sally Ride was born

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:13.890
on May 26th, 1951. She died on July 23rd, 2012. How many days was she alive?

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.840
You should put your answer in this box. You should use BlueJ for this. Open up

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.230
the Days2 project, and here are a couple of hints. You'll want to make

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.235
variables for birthday and lastDay. And then you'll want to call

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:32.820
lastDay.daysFrom(birthday) and print the result. Don't worry too much if BlueJ

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.290
isn't working for you. Just look around the video, and you'll find a link to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.285
the Udacity Java editor that you can use.
