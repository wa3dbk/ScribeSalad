00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.800
The sequence diagram has columns corresponding to individual participants,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.800
usually objects, in the system.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.910
Time marches down the sequence diagram, and horizontal lines between

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.450
columns indicate the passing of a message from one object to another object.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.830
Historically, these sequence diagrams evolved from message

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.730
sequence charts which had been used in the telephony industry for many years.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.300
These diagrams will be semantically equivalent to communication diagrams which

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.400
we'll look at in a minute, but from a slightly different point of view.
