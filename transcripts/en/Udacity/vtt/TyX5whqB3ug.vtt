00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.200
We're going to talk a little bit more

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.380
about streaming and in particular, specific applications

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.340
and how they work. We'll talk about

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.720
a streaming video application, YouTube, and a Voice

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.450
over IP or streaming audio application, Skype.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.090
With YouTube, all uploaded videos are converted

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.660
to Flash or html5 and nearly every

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.320
browser has a Flash plugin. Thus, every browser

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.870
can essentially play these videos. HTTP and

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.530
TCP are implemented in every browser and the

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.540
streams easily get through most firewalls. So,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.770
in this case, even though we've talked about

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.890
why TCP is suboptimal for streaming, the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.950
designers of YouTube decided to keep things simple,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.030
potentially at the expense of video quality.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.435
When a client makes an HTTP request to

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:54.510
youtube.com, it is redirected to a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.120
content distribution network server located in

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.550
a content distribution network, such as

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.890
Limelight or perhaps even YouTube's own content

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.510
distribution network. We will talk about content distribution networks later on

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:16.440
in this course. When the client sends an HTTP get message to this CDN server,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.430
the server responds with a video stream. Similarly with Skype, or Voice Over IP,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.850
your analog signal is digitized through an A to D conversion and

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.320
this resulting digitized bit stream is sent over the internet.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.520
In the case of Skype, this A to D conversion happens by way of the application.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.030
And in the case of Voice over IP this

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.750
conversion might be performed with some kind of phone

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.600
adapter that you actually plug your phone into. An

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.940
example of that might be Vonage. In VoIP with an

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.100
analogue phone the adapter converts between the analogue and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.200
digitial signal. It sends and recieves data packets and then

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.280
communicates with the phone in a standard way. Skype,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.825
on the other hand, is based on what's known as

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:11.890
peer-to-peer technology. Where individual users, using

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.120
Skype, actually route voice traffic through one

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.015
another. We will talk more about

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:20.740
peer-to-peer content distribution, later in this course.
