00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.847
So far we have discussed block ciphers,

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:07.906
which take as an input
a fixed length data block,

00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:13.540
say in 64-bit 40 years,
or 128-bit for 8 years.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.217
What if you want to encrypt
a large message, that is,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:22.350
a message that's longer than 64-bit,
or even 128-bit?

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.530
The solution seems obvious.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.260
Why can't we just break a message
into fixed-size blocks,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.720
apply a block cipher such as DES or
AES on the blocks, then

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.290
the collection of the ciphertext blocks
is the ciphertext of the large message?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.430
Is that it?

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.230
This seems to be very simple.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.300
Let's take a look at a few schemes
that encrypt a large message.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.050
The simplest way is the so-called
electronic code book method or ECB.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.060
Here, the original large message is
broken down into fixed-sized blocks,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.500
say 64-bit, and we pad the last block so
that it is also 64-bit.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.225
And then each plaintext block
is encrypted using the same key

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:09.910
independently of each other.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.873
And the collection of these ciphertext
blocks is the ciphertext of the original

00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:16.660
large message.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.670
The term code book is used, because for

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.310
given key, there is a unique ciphertext
block for every plaintext block.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.320
Therefore, we can construct
a gigantic code book

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.130
in which there's an entry for
every possible plaintext block, and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.330
the table entry shows
the corresponding ciphertext block.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.220
Of course,
we construct one code book for each key.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.830
In practice, only the plaintext blocks
that are used in an application

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.210
need to be included in the code book.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.620
That is, the code book does not need to
include all possible plaintext blocks.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.350
Therefore, it does not
have to be gigantic.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.640
So this seems to be a very convenient
of encrypting a large message.
