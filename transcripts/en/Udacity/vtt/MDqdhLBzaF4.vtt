The second non textual part of UML to be aware of is the Metamodel.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.720
I mentioned this before, it's UML defined in terms of UML. The UML Metamodel,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.060
is a UML description of the UML language. More over,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.860
you can extend the Metamodel. You as a designer can extend the Metamodel.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.640
Using UML profiles and we saw the profile diagram.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.430
Those extensions are more stereotypes, more tag values and you can add

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.040
the constraints. These are constraints on the diagrams now, not on the models
