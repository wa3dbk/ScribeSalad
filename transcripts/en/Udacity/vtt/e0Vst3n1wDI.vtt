00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.880
Now you're going to install
the Java Development Kit, but

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.100
a few quick notes before we begin.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.160
So we've been calling
the Java Development Kit like a toolbox.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.950
And what we mean by that is that the
Java Development Kit is software that

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.420
allows your computer to read and
work with the Java programming language.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.590
This is sort of fundamentally
different than a software program,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.570
because it's more like an upgrade for
your computer.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.700
So as you're installing
the Java development kit,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.780
it might seem a little bit intimidating.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.760
But what I want to tell you right
now is do not worry about it.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.410
You're not going to break your computer.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.510
And we're going to go super
slowly through the steps and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.650
explain what you're doing very
explicitly as you do each step.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.070
That said,
sometimes students run into problems.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.670
So I want to give you some additional
tools to help you resolve those issues.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.260
If you do run into a problem,
I've got three resources for you.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.550
First is the troubleshooting document,
linked in the instructor notes.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.340
Second, is the forums and chat, where
you can ask fellow students for help.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.600
I'll be checking in once in a while to
see what problems students are finding

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.000
and update the first
document accordingly.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.560
So if you do happen to
solve your problem,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.360
consider posting about your
experience in the forums.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.930
When you're talking about an error,
it helps to copy the text of the error.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.650
You can also take a screen shot of the
error by using the keys Ctrl+Cmd+Shift

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.920
on the Mac or
the screenshot key on a Windows machine.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.160
Finally, when I run into errors,
I often Google them.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.430
Nine times out of ten, you're going to
immediately find somebody who's run into

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.570
the exact same error that you have.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.580
And by the power of the Internet,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.470
a lot of people are going to
have come together and

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.020
help them resolve that error.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.540
So you can follow the exact same
steps that they've followed

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.380
to resolve your problem.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.500
Now if you're trying to figure
out what to actually search with.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.480
My suggestion is to copy the error
message that you're getting and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.860
add a word like Java or or
Android studio to the end of it.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.720
Okay.
Let's dive in.
