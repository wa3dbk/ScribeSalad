Again there are a few options here, so if yours doesn't look exactly like mine

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.200
it might still be right. I chose to call the method unfriend, and name the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.975
perimeter that comes in nonfriend. This would be the friend that you are

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:17.910
unmaking. The method doesn't need to return anything. What we're interested in

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.460
is that it mutates the object to reflect the new social developments. It's

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.180
public because it's part of the public interface of the person class. If you

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.460
got this, good work.
