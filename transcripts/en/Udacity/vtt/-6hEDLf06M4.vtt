00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.460
Okay, so that is what a RAT looks like.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.510
It's a table where, for each architectural register, for example, for R0,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.500
it will say where we keep R0 currently. Then for R1, there is another entry and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.610
so on. So this table really just stores where things are. This is just for

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.730
our convenience. You know, we kind of numbered the entries, but

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.570
basically doesn't need to store this zero here,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.790
it's simply that the entry number 0 is for our 0, the entry number 1 is for

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.509
our 1, etc. So now we will have some instructions. Let's first look at

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.770
this first instruction. So let's say the processor is fetching this instruction.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.960
What it does is for all the registers that this instruction needs to read,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.678
it looks in the RAT where those registers can currently be found.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:48.870
Let's say that for R2, this is just saying P2 for now.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.150
So this is physical register 2, which correspond to R2 initially.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.960
And let's say that it's P3 here. In fact, let's say all them are just like this.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.120
So what the processor does is it renames this instruction, so it fetches it,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.080
decodes it, and then rewrites it so that the actual operation that will be

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.000
done is going to be on physical register speed two and P3.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.120
And now the question is where are we going to put our result? Well,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.310
we're going to put our result in a new place for R1, so not in P1.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.870
So we will change the RAT to put the result in some P17 or

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.470
whatever, okay? So now we're going to say that this is, this all goes to P17,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.460
and then we're going to use P23 for the inputs. Let's say that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.750
the next instruction is subtract R1 and R5 and put the result in R4.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.000
What the processor again will do is, so it always follows the same procedure.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.210
Look at the RAT for R1 and R5 to see where those values currently are, and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.280
then rename them. So we're going to look at R1, and it says P17.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.020
So this subtract is renamed into read P17, and P5, and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.920
put the result into a new place for R4. So

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.210
we're going to change the RAT from now on, to put the result in, let's say, P18.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.230
Okay so, I'll evaluate three more instructions and now we can rename them too.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.780
So this XOR will be renamed into an XOR of R7 and R8. Where are they?

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.670
Well, let's say they're in P7 and P8. And then we're going to write to R6.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.719
We're not going to write to P5. That's, where the previous value of, R6 is.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:37.250
We're going to write it to a new register P19. Then we're going to take this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.140
multiply and remember you need to update the RAT every time you produce a new

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.320
value, because that's where subsequent instructions will find the value for

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.910
that register. So we're going to, again, R8 and R9, still no change. So

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.410
they're going to be P8 and P9. The new value for R5 is going to go to P20.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.460
And then we have this ADD R8 and R9 are still in P8 and P9.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.670
The new value for R4 is now going to be P21. Now,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.060
this is an already renamed value, so we're going to rename it again and say P21.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.430
Later on, if there is an instruction that uses R4, so something something R4,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.770
it's going to be renamed into whatever, P21. So the trick here is that,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.080
we have seen that this instruction writes to R4, and this one also writes to R4.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.870
So there is a register name dependence between these two because they're both

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.933
trying to write to R4, but when we rename them this way, the dependency's gone,

00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:41.534
because this is producing P18, this is producing P21. Instructions among these

00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:45.345
that need to write the value, so basically, if something here was reading R4,

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:48.259
it would get the value P18 instead because it's been, it,

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:52.750
it would be renamed to read P18. Anything that follows this instruction,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.890
that wants to read R4 would be renamed so that it reads the P21. So

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.460
simply, the use of R4 as a name for the value produced by this instruction and

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.790
also for the value that's produced by this instruction is what was causing, for

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.820
example, the write after write dependence. We eliminated dependence because here

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.570
the name will be different. This value is going to be named P18.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.290
This one will be P21. There is no more dependence.
