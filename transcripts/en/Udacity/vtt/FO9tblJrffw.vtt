00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.740
So far we've talked about a lot of
numbers, both positive and negative, and

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:09.430
our world of numbers is looking pretty
great. Still, we've really only been

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:14.380
counting by ones, whether above or below
0. This might be a problem however.

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:19.495
Thinking back to your famous birthday
party, what if your friend had baked a few

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:24.560
cakes instead of making a ton of cupcakes?
If you asked someone how much cake they

00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:29.405
wanted and they only knew about integers,
they would have to say that they either

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:34.300
wanted no cake at all, or they wanted 1
whole cake, or maybe even 2 entire cakes.

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:38.990
This doesn't seem very practical and
you'll also run out of cake very quickly.

00:00:39.092 --> 00:00:43.990
You would probably want to cut each cake
into slices and then give each person just

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:49.587
a piece of the cake. Let's say that you
cut 1 of the cakes into 8 pieces. If you

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:55.203
gave 5 friends each 1 of those slices, how
much of that cake would be left over?
