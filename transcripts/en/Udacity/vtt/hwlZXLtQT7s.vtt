00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer to this quiz is any answer is acceptable.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's perfectly possible that the answer we expected from square root of 9 is 3.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In fact, that's what we would expect most of the time.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But also, -3 is a perfectly correct answer for the square root of 9.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The issue that we're getting at here is what's the specification for the software under test,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
for our square root routine?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Is it defined to return the positive value? the negative value?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Can it return either of them?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And this is what we're getting at here 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is that software always operates under some sort of a specification.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Of course, most of the time, specification isn't actually available to us

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in some sort of a clear technical document.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Often the specification is vague or it's written down in English.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Part of our job as a tester is to help refine the specification by figuring these things out,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
by figuring out what the acceptable answers really are.
