00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.836
So, now we're in a fancy little spot. We can create a physics engine, update

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:06.908
it, delete objects from it, add bodies to it, entities in the environment can

00:00:06.908 --> 00:00:11.611
add their own physics bodies and of course update them over time. And now, we

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.453
get to the final part of the equation, how we actually drive the entire

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:18.674
simulation from our game engine object. This is a little bit easier than you

00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:21.700
think. Inside of our game engine class, we first define the number of physics

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.450
updates that we want per frame. Now remember, before, we were talking about the

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.474
number of physics loops steps we would like to occur inside of a frame to move

00:00:28.474 --> 00:00:32.789
our world forward. In the game engine's setup function, we actually need to

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.112
call an initializer on our Global Physics Engine class. And also inside of the

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:40.346
game engine's update function, we need to actually call the physics engine dot

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:44.900
update method so that it'll do a step process on all of the world objects.
