00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.050
So why does the 0x20 encoding make DNS more secure? Is it because DNS names

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.252
are case-sensitive? Is it because the encoding adds

00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:12.160
additional entropy to the query? Is it because

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.670
the encoding make its easier to encrypt

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.830
the queries and replies, or is it because

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.572
the encoding adds the requirement for an additional

00:00:20.572 --> 00:00:24.690
layer of hierarchy into the DNS resolution infrastructure?
