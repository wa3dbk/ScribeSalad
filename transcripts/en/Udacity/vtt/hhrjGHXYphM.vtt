00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is all basic probability and doesn't get us into confidence intervals, but let's do it now.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's say we have a sample of size 1, 2 and 10.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We know that the variance of each of those individual coin flips is 0.25,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but I want to add up all the outcomes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What is the mean when I just sum up the outcomes--I've not yet computed the average--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and what is the variance when I sum up all the outcomes for all the samples?

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's do the means first.
