In both Egyptian and Greek mythology, it's said that art was invented by

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.727
someone tracing the shadow of a person on a cave wall. Shadows give a scene

00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:10.412
more realism and solidity. An object's shadow firmly establishes its location

00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:14.242
in relation to its surroundings. Rasterization is focused on triangles rendered

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:18.158
from the eye, so we have to work a bit to generate shadows. One popular method

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:22.610
of adding these is called shadow mapping. This algorithm dates way back. It was

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.598
first described by Lance Williams in 1978. The idea is to render the scene from

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:30.520
the point of view of the light. Whatever the light sees, is what gets lit.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.890
Remember our firefly with human eyeballs? This is where that answer comes into

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.640
play. If a light doesn't see a surface, that means the surface is in shadow. In

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.806
fact, this is exactly how the basic algorithm is done. The scene is rendered

00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:44.784
from the view of the light. And the distance of the closest objects is stored

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:48.409
at each pixel. Because the light has to look in a particular direction, and has

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.032
a limited field of view the light source used for shadow mapping is often a

00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:54.888
spotlight of some sort. A spotlight can be pointed in a direction, and has a

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.754
constrained view of the world. In 3JS the only lights capable of casting

00:00:58.754 --> 00:01:02.366
shadows are spotlights and directional lights. For directional lights, you

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.729
specify the limits of how wide the light extends.
