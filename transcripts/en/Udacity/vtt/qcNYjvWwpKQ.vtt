Once simple way to think of transparency is that you want to see a bit of both

00:00:06.062 --> 00:00:10.995
objects. So, say, we have these two objects on the screen and, so, opaque sphere

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:15.978
and this red filter on top of it. This is a blow up of the pixels and this shows

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:21.366
the sphere itself being rendered. So, if we want to add this red filter, what we

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:26.951
could do is fill-in every other pixel with red to make it look semi-transparent.

00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:30.870
The idea here is that pixels are tiny. So ,the eye will blend the two colors

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.979
together to get a magenta when the objects overlap like this. This is a very

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:39.496
limited form of transparency, however. It only supports two objects and only a

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:44.070
50/50 mix looks good. This algorithm is called Screen-Door Transparency because

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.898
you're treating the pixels as like they're a screen door, and you're filling in

00:00:47.898 --> 00:00:50.464
every other pixel with a semi-transparent object.
