Let's now consider linear regressions of standard scores.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Recall the standard score for x, zₓ is equal to       xᵢ - x-bar divided by the standard deviation of x.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's assume we standardize both x and y,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so we now have a set of zₓ's computed this way and zᵧ's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.000
for the equation zᵧ = b zₓ + a.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'd like you to tell me about the values of a and b.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Specifically, tell me what is their minimum value on any given data set

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and what is the maximum. Please fill in your answers here.
