00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.043
The linear terms add up to zero, if you got it, great work. We can see that for

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:10.190
this problem the positive 4x and the negative 4x add up to 0. This middle terms

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.165
are linear terms, sub is 0. So we're left with x squared minus 16. The same is

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:18.613
true down here for this case and for this third case.
