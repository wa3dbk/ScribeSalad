00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.348
So what's really surprised you over the last five years in terms of how CUDA has developed

00:00:03.348 --> 00:00:05.917
and how people have used it? And I'll throw one thing out there.

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:09.334
I think the day that I was disclosed on CUDA, right before it launched,

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:11.720
if you had asked me at the time I would have said,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.388
"In 5 years, maybe people aren't going to be programming so much in CUDA."

00:00:15.388 --> 00:00:18.089
"Instead people are going to build higher level languages on top of this,

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.586
and that's what we're going to be using."

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.127
But CUDA's really proven to have legs

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:26.169
and is a very efficient way to keep these machines busy with lots of work to do.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.575
So I certainly would have lost a bet I made then.

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:31.392
What have been some of the things that have surprised you?

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:34.763
I think one of the things that surprised me the most is just the diversity of fields,

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:37.918
and really, you can't predict it in some regards but you can.

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:43.055
There are applications for computing in tons of spaces,

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:48.095
and we have a vision of if computation is free, what would that mean,

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:51.210
and what would it mean for everyone? And we can inspire ourselves.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.702
But there are all these short-term things that we can go achieve with GPUs

00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:58.099
that were simply just not--no one thought of.

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.251
There may be a small group of people out there that were researching them,

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:07.503
but by giving them this processor where computation is effectively free

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:11.295
and memory bandwidth is 10 to 100x faster than what you're used to,

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:13.465
they're just unleashed.

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:19.764
ASTRA GPU. There's an actual conference now on doing astronomy simulations with GPUs.

00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:22.099
And they were one of the first people to jump on the bandwagon

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.378
because they have a really big problem.

00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:31.332
They're trying to simulate galaxies and black holes and star formation, and they were just stuck.

00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:36.675
The simulations were so hard and they'd maybe get to run it on a super computer

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.076
for a brief few cycles at a time.

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:43.512
But now all these guys are able to do their computing right at their desktop

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:47.544
and actually prove theory about how stars form, how a galaxy forms.

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:52.461
I mean, I think no one ever knew this kind of problem that existed

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:54.529
because this little community was off to themselves.

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:57.960
But we discovered these things, and we're so excited to see that we make a difference.
