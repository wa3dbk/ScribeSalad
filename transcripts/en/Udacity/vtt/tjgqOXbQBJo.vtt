00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.040
So even if you're too young to have used Napster,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.150
I'm pretty sure that most of you know and use Skype,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.180
a Voice Over IP and instant messaging service. Many of

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.790
you, however, probably don't know how Skype works. To understand that,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.360
let's have a look at Skype's architecture, which I'm sketching

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.890
here, and which is a peer-to-peer architecture with a small twist.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.300
So first of all, by looking at the architecture we can

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.600
see that whereas Napster was a client-server system with an element

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.960
of peer-to-peer, Skype is a much more decentralized system. Why

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.940
is that? Well, if we look here, we can see

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.720
that there is a login server -- this node over

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.670
here -- and that means that every Skype user has to register

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.000
with this centralized service. But that's the only interaction of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.930
this kind within Skype. After you log in, all you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.580
get is a connection through a super node like this

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.760
one. So, what are super nodes? Super nodes are highly reliable

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.680
nodes with high bandwidth that are not behind a firewall

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.180
and that runs Skype regularly, which means that nodes that shut

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.540
down Skype occasionally will not qualify as super nodes. And one

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.239
interesting thing about super nodes is that they're not owned by

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.990
Skype. They're just regular nodes that get promoted by Skype to

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.500
super nodes, and that know about each other. So basically Skype

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.710
has an algorithm that looks at the nodes in the system

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.880
and decides whether a node can be a super node or

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.932
not based on its characteristics. So now that we've discussed

00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:22.040
super nodes, let's see what will happen if peer two wanted

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.091
to communicate with peer three. So let's represent this by

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:27.956
creating a dashed line between peer two and peer three. In

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:30.980
this case, peer two will contact this super node, which

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.750
is super node A. And super node A, based on its

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.570
knowledge of the Skype network and the position of the super

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.930
nodes, will contact and route the communication through super node C,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.100
which will in turn route the communication to peer three.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.620
And in that way peer two and peer three will be

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.740
able to communicate with each other. And this will happen just

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.970
as if peer two and peer three were connected directly, as

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.760
peers, even though the communication goes through two super nodes. Another

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.470
thing that is important to know about the behavior of Skype

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.760
is that, if the link between super nodes A and C

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.950
were to go down. So let's assume that there is a

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.840
problem with this link, then Skype will automatically, or automagically

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.550
reroute the communication through super node B, which will in

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.950
turn reroute it super node C, which will again reroute

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.020
to peer three. So peer two and three will still

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.550
be connected, but this time they will be going through

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.620
three super nodes. And just in case you wondered, this

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.620
is exactly what happens when you are talking over Skype.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.790
The quality of the communication degrades, and you are reconnected.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.880
So there is this rerouting going on through different nodes. So

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.640
although this architecture is more effective than the Napster's one, it

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.640
is not without problems. For example, you might remember that a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.640
few years ago, Skype went down for about 36 hours. And

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.880
later on it was discovered that the cause was the algorithm

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.460
used by Skype to determine which nodes could be super nodes.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.330
And remember, as I said, that one requirement for these nodes

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.130
is that have to up all the time. So what happened

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.420
is most of the super nodes were running on Windows machines,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.820
and Microsoft pushed a critical patch that required a reboot to

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.860
be installed. So a large number of machines, and therefore a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.150
large number of super nodes were down roughly at the same

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.980
time throughout the globe. And Skype's algorithm for determining super nodes

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.230
didn't have enough nodes to work with. So the whole system

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.790
crashed and burned. So the message I want to give here,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.340
is that when you have a large peer to peer distributed

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.650
system, such as this one, such as Skype,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.200
these kind of perfect storms can happen. Because you

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.560
are not really in control. Because the control

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.170
is distributed. So the algorithms become more complex. So

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.140
to wrap up our Skype example, in case

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.280
you are interested, Skype then fixed the issue by

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.950
changing the algorithm for identifying super nodes. And

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.084
more recently actually, Skype ditched peer-to-peer super nodes altogether.
