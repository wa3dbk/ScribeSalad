00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.190
So, the top most directory in the file
system is the root directory.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.640
And we denote the root
directory with a slash.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.282
You can describe
the location of any file or

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:12.580
directory in the file system,
with a full path beginning with a slash.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.320
The full path is called
the absolute path,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.540
and that means that it tells every step
that has to be taken from the root, or

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.160
the absolute beginning
of the file system.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.500
Absolute paths are unambiguous and
easy to understand, but

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.370
they can also be
inconvenient to work with,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.390
especially if you're working
with deeply nested directories.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.720
To make things simpler,
we can use relative paths instead.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.010
A file's relative path,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.230
is its location relative to
the current working directory.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.610
If you're working with files in or

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.070
near the current working directory,
this can save you a lot of typing.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.520
Every time you've referred
to a file by just its name,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.730
you've actually been
using a relative path.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.880
This is the simplest
sort of relative path.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.230
The shell looks for the specified file
name within the current directory.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.510
For example, if the current
working directory is ocean,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.200
then the relative path of
the clam directory is just clam.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.370
Rather than having the full
path from the root,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.300
we can just have the path
from the working directory.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.590
Oh, and cwd here is just an abbreviation
for current working directory.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.890
You could also write relative paths for
files and other directories.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.470
For example,
the relative path of the giant file,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.446
and the clam directory,
is just clam/giant.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.670
Notice that,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.470
unlike a full path, the relative
path does not start with a slash.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.550
That's how you can tell a relative
path from an absolute one.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.880
You can also write relative paths for
items that are closer to the root.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.828
The special directory entry '..'
points from a directory to its parent.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:40.859
So, if you're in /home/philip/ocean,
and you refer to '..',

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.742
you're talking about
the directory /home/philip.

00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:51.814
And if you refer to ../mountain, you're
referring to /home/philip/mountain.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:54.692
There's also a special
entry which is just '.'.

00:01:54.692 --> 00:01:57.150
'.' points from each
directory to itself.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.950
For example, because our current
working directory is ocean,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.860
if we use .,
that refers to /home/philip/ocean.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.535
Another handy shortcut is ~.

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:10.560
~ is an abbreviation for
your own home directory.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.250
By starting a relative path with ~,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.450
you can easily specify paths
relative to your own home directory.
