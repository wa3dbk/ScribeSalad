00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.350
Okay, answer number one, it's not, this is a trick question. It's actually

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.080
not a trick question. Multiple app servers means multiple caches, and so we

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.100
have to keep them in sync. Yes, that is one source of problems

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.670
we are going to face. You know, we have multiple app servers, let's

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.880
draw a picture, and we've got our database. And say both of these

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.350
guys have their little caches here, you know, let's say both of these

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.590
caches are, are, both of these caches are one, they've got their stuff.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.440
Let's say, a database, you know, a POST comes in here that, the results

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.890
in a database write, which results in a, in a refreshing of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.910
the cache. Now we got one up server with an up-to-date cache and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.260
another up server with an out-of-date cache. And so if the read

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.520
comes in to here We're going to get stale cache. And that's no good.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.640
So we gotta figure figure out a way of keeping these caches

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.360
in sync. Each app server may have to hit the database to update

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.380
its cache. You know, this is a problem. Let's say the situation

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.570
is neither, both of these caches are cold, they're empty. And two read

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.010
requests come in, or many read requests come in. This is similar

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.820
to the cache stampede problem, where Each of these app servers is

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.900
going to want to update its cache which means it's going to have to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.600
hit the database. So that's problematic as well. Now of course we can

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.065
alleviate, you know, some of these problems by updating the cache on

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.470
writes, but we'd still have to find a way of, you know,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.290
keeping these guys in sync with one another which is a little

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.660
tedious. And the final answer we'll

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.800
be caching data redundantly. I'm not accepting

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.410
that one in this quiz as a bad thing because very often

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.200
you do cache data redundantly. That's kind of what a cache is. Right?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.260
You're storing data redundantly and, and I'm actually torn and, and whether

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.420
this should be considered a down time or a plus side or kind

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.350
of neutral. But, for our purposes, we want to focus on, on these

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.440
problems, which is keeping these caches in sync and limiting the number of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.640
database requests we do. Now, the solution we're going to approach here is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.900
going to change this architecture a little

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.850
bit. Instead of each app server having

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.890
its own cache, we're going to move caching into its

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.000
own process. And so now, both these app servers will

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.790
use a shared cache. And so, this cache actually behaves

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.740
very similar to the database except the queries are much

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.110
simpler. They're just key value pairs, and it's probably only

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.790
in memory, and there's technology designed. Specifically to solve this

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.420
problem. Which is to be fast and used as a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.080
cache. Which is different from a database which is designed

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.680
to you know run complex queries on huge

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.484
amounts of data. This piece of technology is called

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:12.848
memchached. And we're going to be spending basically the

00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:14.780
rest of this lecture learning how to use memchached.
