00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.020
We just saw with Caroline that looking at the differences between two files is

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.840
a little bit annoying to do manually and

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.340
that there are tools that make it easy to do automatically.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.447
Think for a bit about how this could help with the process of

00:00:09.447 --> 00:00:10.270
producing good code.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.740
Throughout the course, we'll ask you to take a minute to think about things and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.100
write down your thoughts about material we've just covered.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.140
I know it can be tempting to say, oh, I don't need to do this or

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.360
I'll just wait to see what you guys have to say about it.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.500
But doing these exercises will really help cement the concepts as we go.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.230
Seriously, there's research on this.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.710
Check the instructor notes for details.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.060
Also, later in the course, you'll be getting practice using version control by

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.370
saving different versions of these files.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.012
Since this course isn't about writing code,

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:39.470
this will be one of the primary sources of practice you'll get.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.690
So be sure to actually write something down each time you see one of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.480
these prompts so that you have some content to work with.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.100
Don't worry about pausing this video while you get things set up or

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.520
to see the reflection prompt.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.840
You'll see some directions after this video ends.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.250
We'll ask you to create a separate file for each lesson's reflections.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.764
You'll also want to make sure to use a simple text editor like Sublime,

00:00:57.764 --> 00:00:58.956
Notepad++, Emacs or

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:02.930
Vim, and not a rich-text editor like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.045
And use plain text .txt files so

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:08.120
that you can easily look at their content on the command line.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.770
Please do take the time to do this right now.
