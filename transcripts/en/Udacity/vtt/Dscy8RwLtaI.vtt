00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:03.790
Wow, can you believe the amount
of code we just waded through?

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.730
We first looked at templates
which are just strings.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.590
They use delimiters to section off
where JavaScript data will appear.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.270
Underscores template
function returns a function.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.680
We then call this function with data.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.190
Then we saw how backbone handles events.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.380
It takes an event object and
stores an event and

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.490
callback function in
an _events property.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.460
When the event is triggered on the
object, it runs the callback function.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.060
And we just dug into how routing and
backbone.history work.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.110
The app's router sets up the routes and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.276
their callback function in
backbone.history.handlers.

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:40.510
Then backbone.history.start
watches the URL for changes.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.330
If the URL matches a route,
then it runs the callback function.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.940
These three abilities,
templates, events, and routing,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.270
are key aspects of how frameworks make
developing complicated apps easier.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.910
In the next lesson, we'll move from
looking at the inner workings of

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.480
Backbone to Angular,
a framework by Google.
