What I'm going to do first to deal with
this negative exponent factor is separate

00:00:05.345 --> 00:00:10.445
it out from the rest of the factors. So
I'm just going to multiply a little bit

00:00:10.457 --> 00:00:15.781
more explicitly. So you have 3m^2 times 1/n^-4.
However, we know that when we have a

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:21.126
negative exponent, n^4 in our case, these
factors actually equal to 1/n^4.

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:26.840
So I need to replace just the denominator
of this fraction right here with this

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:30.836
number. So that's going to give us
3m^2 times 1/1/n^4.

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:36.495
This is really not looking very pretty.
However, we know how to handle this.

00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:42.360
Dividing by a fraction is the same as
multiplying by its reciprocal. So, for

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:46.691
example, we have 1 over a/b. That's just equal
to 1 times b/a.

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:51.702
So we can continue modifying this
expression using that trick. This is going

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:56.824
to equal, keeping the 3m^2, we keep the
numerator here, and we multiply by the

00:00:56.836 --> 00:01:01.633
reciprocal of the denominator. So the
reciprocal of 1/n^4 is just n^4/1.

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:06.623
Well now this is easy. You know that
anything times 1 is just itself. And we

00:01:06.635 --> 00:01:12.272
know anything divided by 1 is just itself.
So this leaves us with 3m^2n^4.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:17.488
So again, we see that switching the sign
of an exponent, so switching from negative

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.517
4 to positive 4 here for the factor with
the n base. Just requires a flipping of

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:27.191
the exponent sign and a flipping of the
side of the equation that factors on. We

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:31.879
switch from having n^-4 in the denominator
to having n^4 in the numerator. If you

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:36.503
found working with fractions like this a
little bit difficult, not a big deal at

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:40.540
all. Just take some time to review
manipulation of fractions with the

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:41.153
materials that we've directed you to.
