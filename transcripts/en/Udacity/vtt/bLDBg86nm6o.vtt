00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.533
Let's go through an example of a repeated measures design, where every

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:08.103
participant gets both treatments. These are two cell phones with different

00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:12.490
keyboard configurations. Let's say a researcher is interested in the effects of

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.226
these cell phone configurations on errors made in typing text messages. To

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:24.709
study this, 25 participants used each keyboard type. This is QWERTY since it

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:30.926
spells Q-W-E-R-T-Y in the upper left and an alphabetical keyboard. And they

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:35.418
typed a standardized 20 word text message within 30 seconds. The number of

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:41.400
errors for each person using each type of keyboard was recorded. These

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.555
participants were randomly assigned to which type they used first. In the

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:49.459
Google spreadsheet below, you'll find the data for the number of errors each

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:54.606
person made using each type of keyboard. Find the mean number of errors for the

00:00:54.606 --> 00:00:57.923
QWERTY keyboard and for the alphabetical keyboard.
