00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.496
Here's a pipeline for a pencil making machine. The execution time for each

00:00:03.496 --> 00:00:07.463
stage is shown. The painted pencils produced will have to pile up and wait for

00:00:07.463 --> 00:00:12.402
the pencil neck stage where the eraser gets attached. Two questions. Once it

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:17.569
gets going, at what rate do the pencils come out? The second one is, what is it

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:23.433
called when the previous stage has to wait? It is stalling, aliasing, swimming,

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.579
Peter-Panning, starving or banding?
