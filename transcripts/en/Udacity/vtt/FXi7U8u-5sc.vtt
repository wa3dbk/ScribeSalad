00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.270
So NAT is not a super great solution
to the shortage of addresses in IPv4.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.410
It's a workaround.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.520
But the real solution
has already been built.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.409
And the world is kind of in
the middle of deploying it.

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.141
That solution is IPv6.

00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:17.760
IPv6 is the successor to IPv4.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.395
We're going from 4 directly to 6 because
protocol version 5 was an experiment

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:23.766
that didn't work out.

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:29.404
IPv6 fixes the address shortage problem
by having much longer addresses,

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:32.549
128 bits or 16 octets long.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.180
That's 4 times as long
as an IPv4 address.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.050
2 to the 128th power is really
a colossally huge number of addresses.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.730
Billions and billions of times
bigger than the v4 address space.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.820
In fact, the smallest block of addresses
that can be assigned to an end user.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.060
Like a home in v6,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.420
is a /64 network which is much larger
than the whole v4 address space.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.680
But that means that IPv6
addresses are kind of long.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.190
Like for instance here's
one of Google's addresses.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.853
Now fortunately, the conventional
way of writing these 6 addresses,

00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:09.781
let's a skip writing these zeros here.

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:15.800
Okay, that's better, a little.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.230
Anyway, you might notice that these
don't look much like the four addresses.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.810
They're written in hex digits
instead of in decimal.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.100
In blocks of 2 bytes separated
by colons instead of dots.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.620
But remember this is just
the human readable format.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.360
The network actually sends these
addresses as strings of 128 bits.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.442
Just like v4,
we designate the size of a network block

00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:38.393
with a decimal number of
bits in the network prefix.

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:43.970
Google has all of 2607.f8b0/32.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.490
And many other V6 locks as well.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.100
Remember on IPv4,
a /32 means a single address.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.100
Whereas on IPv6, it's a large
network with 96 bits of subnet and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.500
host address in it.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.546
So the world doesn't need nat with V6.

00:01:58.546 --> 00:02:02.500
There's enough addresses for every
device to get a unique public address.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.370
And IPv6 adoption started out very
slow but it's been growing strong for

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.630
several years.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.383
Between mid 2012 and the end of 2015,

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:14.762
Google's measurement of V6 traffic
they received increased from about

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:18.377
half a percent of all traffic
to about 10% of all traffic.

00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:21.121
And it's higher on weekends
because more home and

00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:24.140
mobile users have V6 than business and
office users.
