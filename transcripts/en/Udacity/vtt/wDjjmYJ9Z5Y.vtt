00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:10.910
Let's go in this direction first. We'll have 8.94 minus 11.14 divided by 0.85.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.760
Since we're using rounded values, we won't get answers that are very precise.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.604
You may have got to negative 2.59 if you round to the hundreths place. But if

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:27.950
we use precise answers without any rounded values, we should get negative 2.58.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.976
And then, here, we're just doing the opposite in the numerator. 11.14 minus

00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:40.871
8.94 divided by the same thing. Which will give us positive 2.58.
