00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.130
In this session,
we're going to talk about operators.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.310
Symbols like plus and

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.220
minus, some of the same symbols you
may have used before in math class.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.960
We're also going to
talk about expressions,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.570
which make use of operators.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.720
Expressions are statements that
can be reduced to a single value.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.950
This session should be a fun one,
so let's get started.
