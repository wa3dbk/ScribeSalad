00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.200
Now that we have a handle on what
constructor functions are and

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.660
how they're created,
let's dive in to underscore source code.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.150
Keep in mind the things
we've been discussing so

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.090
far about template delimiters.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.420
Don't get bogged down in the nitty
gritty details of the function, but

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.740
focus on what is happening to
the template string that's passed in.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.379
Let's do this.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.530
I've got the developer tools
open to the source tab and

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.020
I’ve open the projects at file.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.570
When this line is run, remember that it
converts the template to a string and

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.425
passes it to underscores
template function.

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:39.781
This function is defined
in underscore on line 1415.

00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:43.365
As a tip, you can press control g and
type in the line number.

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:47.510
Now, let's set a break
point on this first line.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.850
Refreshing the page with command or

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.530
control r will pause execution right as
it's starting to build up the template.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.670
We can see that we got to this line
from f j.s by checking the call stack.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.420
Remember that the text variable holds
the contents of the html template.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.540
Chrome will show us what a variable
holds if we now mouse over the variable.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.190
If you're feeling adventurous,
how about you pause the video, and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.540
see if you can step
through the code yourself.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.980
If you get stumped, or even if you make
it all the way through to the end,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.520
come back, and
we can go through it together.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.040
These lines here determine what
delimiters to look for in the template.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.180
If you want to override
the default delimiters,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.360
you can pass them in as part
of the settings argument.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.610
This matcher variable is
the set of delimiters.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.510
Since we didn't override them,
they're the ones we looked at already.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.910
Matcher is a regular expression.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.520
Regular expressions are out of
the scope of this course, but

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.440
it would be helpful to know the basics.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.530
You'll find some resources on regular
expressions in the instructor notes.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.070
These buttons over here let
us step through the code.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.730
And I'll use them as we
move through everything.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.410
This line starts the new source string.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.260
The rest of the function
will add to this string.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.530
This is what will become the body
of the constructor function.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.730
These lines here take the text and

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.210
replaces it with the contents
of the matched delimiter.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.740
Let's step through one
loop to see how it works.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.480
Replace user's maitre which if you
remember is a regular expression.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.390
To search for a starting and
ending delimiter pair.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.020
The first one it found
is stored in match.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.080
The delimiters that were found in
this match were the interpolate ones.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.870
Looking at the current scope,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.280
the match's content is stored
in the interpolate variable.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.940
If the contents were stored
in the escape variable,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.540
then that variable would
get saved to a T variable.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.700
Which gets wrapped in
underscore's escape function and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.900
is added to the source string.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.760
If the contents were stored
in the escape variable

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.260
then that variable will get saved to
a T variable which gets wrapped in

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.610
underscore's escape function and
is added to the source string.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.220
If the contents were
stored in Interpolate,

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.750
then it gets directly added
to the source string.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.620
If the contents are stored in evaluate,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.220
then it gets directly added
to the source string.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.880
Interpolate and
evaluate are similar, but

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.910
interpolate will insert the contents.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.330
While evaluate will
actually run the code.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.340
The replace function loops through
the entire text string until it finds

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.690
all the delimiters and adds their
contents to the source string.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.830
The next few lines add a little bit
more to the front of the source string.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.080
We've been using the t and
p variables already.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.930
This is where they are created.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.780
All of the hard work of building up
the source string is finally about

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.760
to pay off.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.760
A new function is created with
the source string as the last argument.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.990
Remember that the last argument to a
constructor function becomes the body of

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.840
that function.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.360
This new function is stored in render.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.290
Now this render function, and this
template function are very important.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.140
Template will be called at
some later point with data.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.740
When template is called it calls render
and passes along the data it receives.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.870
Believe it or not, that's the end.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.480
Underscore adds a source property to
the function, which we used earlier, and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.830
then it returns the template function.
