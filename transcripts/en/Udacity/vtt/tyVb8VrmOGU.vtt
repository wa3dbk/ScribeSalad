00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.600
Alright Sam, we're going to build an app to manage a music festival.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.120
&gt;&gt; That seems like a very big problem, managing a

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.280
music festival. How, how do you approach a problem that big?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.500
&gt;&gt; I mean there a lot of aspects to a music festival, right? So the easiest

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.290
way to go about it would be first to think about it from a high level.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, to sort of understand what it means to be a music festival.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.330
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, break it down into the components we

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.690
want to track. Like, we went to a music festival

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.220
last weekend. What did we see there?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was really interesting because, you know, we were both

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.130
there at this same festival, but we were definitely focusing on different

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.290
aspects. Like, I was digging the music, the art, the crowds, and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.620
you were paying attention to some things I'd never thought of before.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.430
&gt;&gt; I mean don't get me wrong. I was

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.600
definitely paying attention to the music and the crowd

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.370
too, and that was awesome. But I was also

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.380
really impressed by the overall structure of the event.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.380
&gt;&gt; Right, and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.560
that was something that I had never really considered before.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.470
&gt;&gt; I mean from a logistics point of view, it

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.630
was all really pretty impressive. There's so much planning that had

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.920
to go into the organizing of multiple stages and bands. I

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.718
mean, making sure that everyone would have the right equipment, there

00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:08.780
were ticket collectors, security guards, food vendors. I mean, so much

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.230
stuff that all had to be planned and managed. So for

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.500
now, let's just start small and focus on how to manage

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.280
and keep track of one aspect of the festival, the attendees.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.260
&gt;&gt; Right,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.980
because it seems reasonable that a festival manager would want to

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.850
keep track of the people going. I'm not sure what, would this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.800
person actually want to track about these attendees. What would they,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.630
how would they do it? so yeah, let's, let's think about it.
