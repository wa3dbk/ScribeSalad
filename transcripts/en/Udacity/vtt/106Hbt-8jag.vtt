00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.474
For the cube root of 40, we have 2 times this cube root of 5. For the fourth

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:08.837
root of 48, we have 2 times the fourth root of 3, and for the fourth root of

00:00:08.837 --> 00:00:13.846
64, we had 2 times the fourth root of 4. And finally, for our last answer,

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:18.370
we'll have 5 times the cube root of 20. Fantastic work for getting at least of

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.962
those correct. These were pretty tough. For the first one, we can rewrite 40 as

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:27.762
eight times five. Eight is the same thing as two cube so now we have a perfect

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:32.700
cube or a factor that appears three times within our radical. We can use the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.566
product rule to split this radical up into the product of two radicals. We know

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:42.400
that a cubed root undoes a cubed power. So we're really left with just 2 here.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.389
This also goes in line with our thinking, a power divided by root. 3 divided 3

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:51.600
equals 1 so we just have 2 to the 1. We can't simplify the 5 so that stays

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.960
inside of its cubed root and we have that multiplied on the end with our

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.250
answer. 2 times the cube root of 5. For the fourth root of 48, we split up 48

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.538
into 16 times 3. We rewrite 16 as 2 to the 4th and then we can take the fourth

00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:11.350
root up to the fourth. The root undoes the fourth power. We leave the 3 inside

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.583
of the fourth root since we don't have four factors of 3, we just have one of

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:20.878
them. So our final answer is 2 times the fourth root of 3. We use a similar

00:01:20.878 --> 00:01:27.527
method for finding the fourth root of 64. We rewrite 64 as 16 times 4. Take the

00:01:27.527 --> 00:01:32.138
4th root of 2 to the 4th which leaves us with 2 times the 4th root of 4. For

00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:37.384
our last one we split up 2,500 into 25 times 100, 25 equals 5 squared and 100

00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:42.765
equals 5 times 20. We do this step so that way we can get three factors of 5

00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:48.598
together. We know that the cube root of phi cubed is just 5. 20 is not a

00:01:48.598 --> 00:01:54.880
prefect cube since the factors of 20 are 2, 2, and 5. There's not three factors

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.633
that repeat. This means 20 stays inside of our cubed root, and we are left with

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:03.104
our final answer. 5 times the cube root of 20.
