00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.656
As we saw in the quiz before this one,
when we multiplied y^4 times y^-2, we used our

00:00:05.668 --> 00:00:11.410
short cut to say that this is just equal
to, of course, leaving the x^2 there,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.660
y^4-2 power. The role that this -2
exponent here plays then, is that it makes

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:22.792
it so that, in the final answer, which we
know is x^2y^2, we have two fewer y's

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:29.016
multiplied together than we did in at
least this first part, the y^4 factor of

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:35.397
the original expression. But how do you
write y^-2 in terms of multiplying some

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:40.341
number of y's together. Well if we know
that y^4xy^-2=y^2.

00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:46.410
And also, we remember that y^4 is four ys
multiplied together. And similarly, y^2 is

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:51.812
two ys multiplied together. This y^ -2
needs to cancel out two of these other

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:57.397
four ys that are multiplied together, to
give us our final answer. Now, we know

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.061
that the way that we undo multiplication
is division. y^4 needs to be divided by

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:08.003
y^2, to equal y squared, we can write this
out like this. We have four y's multiplied

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:12.057
together, divided by 2 y's multiplied
together, and each of these y's in the

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.376
denominator cancels out one of the y's in
the numerator, since everything here is

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:20.405
just multiplied together. This is how we
end up with just two y's multiplied

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:25.543
together. Together, since we can see that
we only have y times y left on the left side. If

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:30.323
we just look at this way of writing our
expression though, we can write both the

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:35.329
numerator and the denominator in terms of
exponents. So, on the top, we still have

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.422
y^4 and the bottom of our fraction we have
y times y, which is just y^2.

00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:45.696
So, if we move this way where an
expression appear to be end up with

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:51.553
y^4 times y^-2=y^4/y^2.
We see this factor may be not we so need

00:01:51.565 --> 00:01:56.845
to multiply this pair x ^ 2 to get a final
answer. In this answer choice right here,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
y^4x^2/y^2.
