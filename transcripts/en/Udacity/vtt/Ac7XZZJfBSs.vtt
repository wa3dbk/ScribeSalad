00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.540
Android Studio is an incredibly
powerful piece of software.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.630
It has an editor with
sophisticated code completion,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.670
and static analysis features.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.780
It also has a suite of tools for
integrating with Android devices and

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.800
emulators.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.510
The one thing it doesn't have, however,
is an integrated build system.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.370
Android Studio delegates the entire
build process to Gradle.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.500
That's everything that happens
to turn your sources and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
resources into an APK that you
can install on your device.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
Gradle itself doesn't inherently
know anything about Android.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.220
That capability's provided by Google in
the form of an Android Gradle plugin.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.340
Android Studio is actually happy to
import and work with any Gradle project.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.720
We can use it to do all
sorts of interesting things,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.089
like build Java libraries or deploy
a backend service to Google App Engine.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.630
Even though Android Studio
isn't building your project,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.940
it still needs a deep
model of your project, so

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.180
it can provide features like code
completion, and auto importing.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.916
It maintains its own internal
model of your project, and

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:57.709
when a project is loaded or
a Gradle build script changes,

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:02.180
Android Studio needs to synchronize its
internal model with Gradle's model.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.190
When you get a "failed to sync" message,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.660
it usually means you've just got
an error in one of your build scripts.
