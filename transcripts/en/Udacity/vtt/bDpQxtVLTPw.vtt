00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.300
Now, that we've created this user.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.750
Let's go ahead and
connect to our server as that user.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.200
I've opened a new terminal here, and
this terminal is on my local machine.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.050
I have not connected to the server yet.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.919
I can connect to the server using this
command, ssh student@127.0.0.1 -p 2222.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.880
Let's break this command
down a little bit.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.280
We've been connecting to our
server using vagrant SSHwhich

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.130
is just a shortcut for all of this.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.439
SSH is the application we use to
remotely connect to the server.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.150
And 127.0.0.1 is the IP
address we want to connect to.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.230
This is a standard IP address
that always means localhost or

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.300
the same computer I'm currently on.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.700
The student@ is the user
we want to log in as.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.068
We want to log in as
student@ this IP address.

00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:59.060
Finally, the -p 2222 flag tells
us to connect using port 2222.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.410
When Vagrant set up our virtual machine,
it automatically set up this port on

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.160
our local machine to forward
to the virtual machine.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.490
After hitting Enter, you may be asked
an authenticity verification question.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.170
Just hit yes, and then you're asked for
the user's password.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.020
Enter that, and
you'll be logged in as the student.
