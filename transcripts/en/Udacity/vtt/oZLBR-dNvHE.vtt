'Kay. Here's, here's an example of, of cascade events or

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.380
broadcast events from Harel's paper. In this case, there are three concurrently

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.170
executed machines labeled A, H, and D. And there are transitions between them.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.310
On some of the transitions there can be an action taking place and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.300
that follows the slash. The actions that we've seen so far you can think of as

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.480
being equivalent to method calls in our object-oriented class model diagrams.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.280
But they could also be the issuing of another event. For example in in,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.941
in state A, there's a transition between substate C and

00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:42.970
substate B that the transition itself is labeled with F.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.570
But then there's a slash, which says if I'm taking this transition,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.550
also issue a new event called G. That is, we've cascaded the event.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.210
Now, the events themselves are globally known. So the issuing

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.750
of the event g here is known to the other machines in the concurrently executing

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.200
state chart. And this process of cascading the events can go on
