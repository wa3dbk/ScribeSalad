00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.352
This last choice is correct. There's no value of x that let's 10 to the x equal

00:00:05.352 --> 00:00:11.436
0. So that means 0 is not in the range of f of x equals 10 to the x. Since log

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:15.979
base 10 of x is the inverse of this function f, it can't be in the domain of

00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:23.396
log base 10 of x. That means that we can't find log base 10 of 0. This value is

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:24.787
just undefined.
