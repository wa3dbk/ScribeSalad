00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.410
The first worm was designed by Robert Morris, Jr. in 1988. The worm

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.290
itself had no malicious payload but, it ended up bogging down the machines that

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.530
it infected by spawning new processes

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.430
uncontrollably and exhausting resources. And at the

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.020
time it was released, it affect ten percent of all Internet hosts. It spread,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.620
through three different propagation vectors. The worm

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.570
tried to crack passwords ,using a small dictionary

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.420
and a publicly readable password file and also

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.100
targeted hosts. That were already listed in a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.510
trusted host file, on the machine that was

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.210
already infected. This ability to perform remote execution

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.125
was one way, that the worm was allowed to spread. The second way that it spread

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:57.540
,was in a buffer overflow vulnerability, In the finger demon. This was a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.920
standard buffer overflow exploid. And ,if you

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.700
don't know about buffer overflows, I would

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.570
urge you to take a computer security coarse. But essentially, this is a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.220
very common attack that makes remote exploits

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.135
possible, effectively resulting in the ability to

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:19.350
run arbitrary code. At the root level

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.070
privilege. The third way that worm spread, was

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.510
via the debug command in send mail, which

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.024
is a mail sending service. In early send

00:01:28.024 --> 00:01:30.230
mail versions, it was possible to execute a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.160
command on a remote machine by sending an

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.250
SMTP message. The worm used this, capability to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.620
spread automatically. A key theme that we'll see

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.860
In the design of other worms, is this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.750
use of multiple vectors. Now any particular worm,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.330
may end up using, a different set of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.670
vectors depending on the remote vulnerabilities that it's trying

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.340
to exploit. But the idea that any worm

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.190
should be able to exploit multiple weaknesses in a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.910
system gives it more ways to spread. And

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.430
often also speeds up the propagation of the worm.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.008
This worm design also followed the following

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:11.820
general approach, which we see showing up over

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.490
and over again in worm designs. First, the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.710
worm needs to scan other hosts to find

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.750
potentially vulnerable hosts. In the second step, it

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.340
needs to spread. By infecting, other vulnerable hosts.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.590
And in the third step, it needs to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.530
remain undiscoverable and undiscovered so that it can

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.080
continue to operate and spread without being removed from systems.
