00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.560
To satisfy our first requirements, we need to find an

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.300
input that causes the execution of this statement. Because this statement

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.080
is executed only when result is greater than zero, our

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.815
test requirement is that a plus b must be greater than

00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:16.219
0. When this is satisfied, this statement is executed therefore

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.960
any test case that implements this specification will cause the execution

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.770
of this statement. Similarly if we want to cover this statement

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.220
which is our second requirement we need to have a result

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.370
that is less than 0. Again, the result is equal

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.490
to a plus b, so all we need to do

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.450
is find the test case such that a plus b

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.700
is less than 0. So this is pretty straight forward.
