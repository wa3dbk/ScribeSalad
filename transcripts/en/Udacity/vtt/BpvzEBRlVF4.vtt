00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now again, of course, this is a bit debatable,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but I think you will all agree that this one

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
here is actually super easy to solve shortest path on,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because let's say you start here, this is your mail station where you start.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You go all the way here and then you have no other choice but to go here,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because you have to visit all those vertices, and then you go back.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so there's not really difficult choices that you have to make

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
when you solve shortest path for this one here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now this one here is a little bit harder.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's say it doesn't really matter where you start out

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because for a tour you can start out at any point

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because you have to come back to it anyway.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And let's say you start out here and then you go up here

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and then you already have your first choice to make,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so do you go this way or do you go that way?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, probably you want to go that way, but actually

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
there are certain distances where you might want to go this way,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so you have to make a choice here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's say we go this way, and here we have to make a choice again,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so do we go this way and back here or do we go this way and here?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So a little bit harder to solve because we have to make certain choices,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but still not quite as hard as this one over here,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which I would think is the hardest  because say we start out here,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
oh, first choice to make, this way or that way, well, that way.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh, again, new choice, this way or that way, let's go that way.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So all the time we have to make choices, which city to visit next,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and this is really tough, so what does this have to do with what

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I just call distance from triviality?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So what does with what I just call distance from triviality?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If I mark the vertices in each of the networks,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
if I mark the vertices in each of the graphs

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that has more than 2 neighbors,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
then here we have just 1,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
here we already have a couple of them,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and this one also although this one is fairly easy, but let's be consistent here,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and here I have a lot of them,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and I'll give you one additional graph, which looks something like this.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now this has a bit fewer vertices, but that's not the point here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The point is that this graph down here

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
doesn't have any vertices that I would color

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because all vertices have exactly 2 neighbors,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and this here is what I would call a trivial instance for shortest path,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because you don't really have to make any choices where you want to go.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here you also don't have to make any choices,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but what you see here is that the number of vertices that have more than 2 neighbors

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
actually is an indicator of how hard it is to solve

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
shortest tour on that respective graph.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If you have a few of these blue vertices here that have more than 2 neighbors,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
then it's easier to solve shortest tour.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now I cannot give you the precise algorithm for this here

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because actually that is a bit more complicated to figure out

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and doesn't only have to do with these vertices here,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but I think you get the intuition

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that we could try to use the number of these blue vertices

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
or some additional structural information as a parameter,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and it turns out that if you do this the right way,

00:02:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
then shortest tour is somewhat fixed-parameter tractable.
