00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.360
The sixth issue is also technical in nature.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.370
It has to do with using objects as components.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.170
It is tempting to identify objects and components, and

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.420
many component technologies do exactly that, for example, JavaBeans.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.660
After all, both objects and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.710
components represent encapsulated state that supports operations.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.080
However, there are problems that arise when using objects to

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.030
implement components.
