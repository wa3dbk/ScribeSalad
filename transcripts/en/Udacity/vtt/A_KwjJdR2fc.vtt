00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.270
Here is how I solved the problem.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.280
I used an iOS class called NSURL, which comes with a function fileURLWithPath.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.890
Now it turns out that this function does exactly what we want it to do.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.480
It takes in a string and spits out an NSURL.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.310
Now I can use this variable, which is of type NSURL,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.430
in step two of our pseudocode, which is to create an instance of AVAudioPlayer.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.380
Okay, I can create a new variable and call it audioPlayer.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
And, then I can initialize it by calling the constructor for AVAudioPlayer.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.050
And, as soon as I start typing it, Xcode gives me some suggestions.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.150
Let me choose the one which takes in NSURL as an argument.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.660
Let me hit Enter to accept the suggestion.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.110
Okay, so this value here is the file path URL.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.020
So let me replace that.

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:52.740
And error for now, I will enter as nil.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.710
All right. So the last thing to do in our pseudocode is to play the audio.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.520
To do this, I will go back to the action playSlowAudio.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.350
Remember, this is the function that gets executed when we

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.710
press the button with the snail image on it.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.266
And in here I will simply say audioPlayer.play().

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.430
Huh, it seems like there is a bug in our program.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.820
It says use of unresolved identifier audioPlayer.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.430
Can you check what to see what's going on here and help me solve this problem?

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.430
Here is your question one more time.
