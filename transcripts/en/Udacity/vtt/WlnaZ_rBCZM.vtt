00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.100
Back in the days when there was just
one screen density for devices,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.840
a designer might create a pixel perfect
logo or other graphic in Photoshop.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.860
Now that was fine,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.490
until more screen densities started
coming along, like HDPI and XHDPI.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.040
You'd need to redraw the pixels
in the graphic at a larger size

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.550
to ensure it was the same
physical size but

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.840
look perfectly crisp on
the higher density screen.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.120
With four or
five popular density buckets these days,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.890
this practice can get really tedious,
really really quickly.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.400
Designers who don't want to repeat
themselves should use a graphics app

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.530
that can work with and
export vector graphics.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.690
Apps like Photoshop and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.570
Gimp are geared primarily to
working with rastrographics.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.660
That means they store the actual
color information for

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.000
each pixel in the resulting image.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.300
Those raser images can be
scaled down with no problem but

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.120
you start to see blurring and other
bad artifacts when you enlarge them.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
Vector graphics apps like Ink Scape,
Illustrator, and

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.520
Sketch, instead store information about
the individual shapes in the image.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.250
For example, the center and
the radius of the circle.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.640
So you can scale the image up or
down without any loss of quality.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.890
The shapes will just be
drawn at a larger size.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.670
While Photoshop let's you work with
vector graphics too, Illustrator and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.705
Sketch actually let you export your
graphics to vector format like SVG or

00:01:21.705 --> 00:01:23.505
Scalable Vector Graphic.

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:27.785
In newer versions of Android, you can
directly use vector images in your app,

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:30.905
using a format similar to basic SVG.

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:34.385
Sure beats exporting a bunch of png
files over and over again, right?
