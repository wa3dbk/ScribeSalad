00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.780
One challenge when using arrays is that the length is fixed.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.100
So let's say that you need to collect some numbers and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.340
you don't quite know how many, you're going to have to make

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.680
an array that's large enough to hold them all. But then

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.680
you may have fewer numbers in the array. Then it can

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.430
hold. We say such an array is partially filled, just like

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.840
this beaker over here. You wouldn't want it to be filled

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.490
up all the way to the rim. And in this situation you

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.450
need to keep track of two things. You need,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.300
the overall length of the array. So here I'll

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.290
assume I'll never have more than 1000 numbers. I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.890
allocate my array to have this length and then I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.000
keep a companion variable that I call the size

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.070
that tells me how many elements I currently have.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.580
Right now, I don't have any. Whenever I need

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.120
to insert a new element, I execute this code here.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.300
I move the new value into values in

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.730
bracket size, and then I increment the size. For

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.820
example, to insert the very first element, size

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.530
is 0, values bracket 0, is now initialized, and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.740
the size becomes 1. The next time, values of 1 Gets filled and so on. Now what

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.090
happens if I fill up the array with a thousand values and then want to add the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.170
thousand and first. Let's have a look at that situation.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.530
So here I have my partially filled beaker. I fill in

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.760
more and more, and eventually when it gets full, what

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.710
choice do I have? I have to get a bigger one

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.630
and pour everything into that. It's the same with partially

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.580
filled arrays. So, here's my array. It's almost full. Now it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.920
completely full. I'd like to add another element. So, I'll

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.270
get myself an array that's twice as long, copy over all

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.710
the values, and now I can forget about

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.200
the old array, and insert my next element over

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.930
here. Of course, one can program that by hand,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.030
but as it happens There's a library function that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.460
does the work for us. Here it is. The

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.060
copyOf function takes an array and then the desired

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.480
length of the larger array. It then makes the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.160
larger array and copies the original one in there,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.979
returns the large array, and we just capture it here again. So that's what

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.590
you'd have to do if you're ever faced with a situation Where you want

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.240
to collect an arbitrary number of values. It's that kind of thing that makes

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.210
you appreciate the array lists where you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.090
never have to worry about growing an array.
