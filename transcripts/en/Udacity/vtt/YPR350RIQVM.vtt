00:00:00.077 --> 00:00:01.846
The circle has a radius of 4

00:00:01.846 --> 00:00:05.506
and its center is at the point 2, -3.

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:08.247
Great work if you found these two answers.

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:13.556
Again, we'll start by moving this constant term of -3 to the right hand side.

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:16.021
So we'll add 3 to both sides of our equation.

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:19.860
Then I'll regroup my two x terms together 
on the left hand side,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.353
and I'll regroup my two y terms on the
left hand side as well.

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:30.006
Now I'm ready to complete the square for the x terms
and the y terms.

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:32.806
We add 4 to complete the square for the x terms

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:35.804
and we addd 9 to complete the square for the y terms.

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:38.579
Keep in mind we also need to add 4 and 9

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.578
to the right hand side of our equation

00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:42.894
to make sure it's balanced.

00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:46.984
So, these three terms can be written as x - 2 squared

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.688
these three terms can be written as y + 3 squared

00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:55.667
and then we simply combine these three terms to get +16.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.973
So now our equation is in a form we recognise.

00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:01.747
Our centre is at 2,-3.

00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:03.707
Since the h value is +2

00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:06.894
and the k value is -3.

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:09.603
We take the square root of our constant term

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.395
to get a radius equal to 4.

00:01:12.395 --> 99:59:59.000
Again great solving if you got these two answers.
