00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello, my name is Adam, and I'll be your assistant instructor

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
for Introduction to Statistics.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Welcome to our first problem set covering visualization.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's get started.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First, I'd like to ask you about a scatterplot,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
specifically about the relationship between GPAs

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or grade point averages in high school and college.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
GPAs are a measure of academic performance

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and range from 0 being the worst to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
4 being the best,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so let's look at some simulated data

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that might describe such a relationship.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
A student who received the highest GPA in both,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a 4 and a 4, would be right about here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And let's fill in the rest of the points.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So looking at this relationship,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I would like you to tell me whether the relationship

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
between high school and college

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
GPAs is linear

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and whether it is exact.

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
