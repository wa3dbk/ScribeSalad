00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.110
A design study is a rigorous and systematic evaluation of the factors that

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.930
influence a design. It should begin with a determination of the relevant

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.540
criteria, how they are to be measured, and what measurement values are deemed

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.110
satisfactory. The study itself consists of a comparison of the various possible

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.760
approaches in which each approach is measured against the predetermined criteria
