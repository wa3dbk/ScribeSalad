00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.811
The problem is that you could make an argument for just about any of these. You

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:08.345
could make an argument for any of the corners or intersection points of the

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:13.322
bounding boxes or even the centroid of them. Or, maybe you don't want to use a

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:17.165
point of intersection, maybe instead you want to select the entire area as a

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:22.806
subsection of these bounding boxes. Which one you do is really up to you and it

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:26.588
can have a lot of effect on how the rest of your physics or collision engine

00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:28.707
works.
