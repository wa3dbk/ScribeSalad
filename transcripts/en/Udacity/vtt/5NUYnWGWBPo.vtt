00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.355
The next optimization technique in Stratton's taxonomy is called privatization.

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:08.518
So where tiling exploited the fact that multiple threads are reading from the

00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:13.797
same memory locations, thread sharing input is good, privatization helps avoid

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.729
having multiple threads write to the same output locations.

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:21.878
So privatization takes some output data shared by multiple threads and duplicates it,

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:25.636
so that different parallel threads can operate in their own private copy.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:30.407
The private copies are eventually merged together to recreate the result that would of been

00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:33.714
produced in the share data used by all the threads before privatization.

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:36.397
So histogram makes a good example.

00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:39.262
As you've learned from our previous discussions and problem sets on histogram,

00:00:39.262 --> 00:00:41.438
there's a bunch of ways that you can approach the problem.

00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:44.077
In particular, you can program the kernel to have each

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:47.927
thread keep its own local histogram as it looked at a bunch of pixels,

00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:52.315
and then use atomics or a global reduce operation to combine the buckets from the

00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:55.381
histograms from all the threads into one set of shared results.

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.908
You can also apply this idea hierarchically.

00:00:57.908 --> 00:01:02.259
For example, you can have each thread block compute a combined histogram in shared memory,

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:05.177
and then have other thread blocks do the same,

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:09.744
and then accumulate the results into a single global histogram.

00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:13.725
So in this example we would have per-thread privatized histograms,

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:16.754
and per-block privatized histograms.

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:19.343
Now in practice, the GPU has so many threads that

00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:22.096
you don't want each one to have a huge private data structure.

00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:25.654
So this approach might work well for a small histogram-- say 5 or 10 buckets--

00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:30.185
but you would probably skip the per-thread privatized copies for a histogram with hundreds of buckets,

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:33.616
and just do the local version per block.
