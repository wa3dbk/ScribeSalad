00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.122
To answer this question, I'll start with some of the code that I was using in

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:07.810
the hint videos. Here's the homework scores class. And so far, it's keeping

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.539
track of a sum and a number of scores. This code returns a sum but doesn't

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.102
actually think about excluding the lowest. The way I see this problem, there

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:19.798
are two key insights. The first is that to return the total excluding the

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:25.144
lowest. We don't necessarily need to permanently remove the low score. If we

00:00:25.144 --> 00:00:28.153
can find the low score, we can return the total minus the low score, just

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:33.095
subtract it off at the last moment. The second insight is that we don't need to

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:37.882
save all of the scores to know what the lowest score is. We only need to save

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:41.726
the value of the lowest scores itself, so instead of a method that finds the

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:45.694
lowest score I will create an instances variable to track the lowest score so

00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:49.414
far, I will define it as private double lowest which probably make these

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:52.204
private to, now I am going to need some special cases in my

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:56.110
getTotalExcludingLowest because if the number of scores is zero, I want to

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.768
return zero, but if the number of scores is one, I want to return that one

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:10.206
score which is currently the sum. And if there are more then I want to return

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:15.265
the sum without the lowest score. To keep track of how many scores there are,

00:01:15.265 --> 00:01:20.038
I'm using the counting pattern. I start with the number of scores being zero

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:25.172
and when I add a score, I increment the number of scores by one. Now, for this

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:30.381
new variable, lowest score. Or lowest, as I'm calling it. I need to come up

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:35.862
with an initial value. Ideally I would initialize it with the first score. But

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:39.742
I don't know what that is yet in the constructor. So I'll initialize it with

00:01:39.742 --> 00:01:44.120
minus one, and promise never to look at it until I've added at least one score.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.570
This is a good example of why you want to keep your instance variables private.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.720
People using the homework scores class might not realize that lowest isn't

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.070
always initialized. Only the homework scores class knows about this

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.764
implementation detail. And when you mark this as private, it shows that the

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:05.640
homework scores objects are responsible for interpreting the data inside of the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.430
lowest score variable. So outsiders don't need to remember things like, I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.446
shouldn't look at the lowest score until I've added scores. So now I've

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:20.704
initialized the lowest score, but I need to think about how it's changing. I'll

00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:24.608
need to make sure that in add score, when there aren't any scores yet, I should

00:02:24.608 --> 00:02:30.156
initialize lowest to be the given score. Then I need to think about, what

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:34.530
happens when I add additional scores. The lowest score seen so far can change

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.324
whenever I add a score. This is a lot like looking for the minimum score in a

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:43.910
loop. When I see a new score, if the score is less than the lowest so far, I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.460
update the lowest to be score, now it looks like under both of these conditions

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.870
numScores is zero or the score is less than the lowest, I change the lowest to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.280
be the score, so let's make this into one if statement, if num score is zero or

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.480
score is less than lowest, then lowest equal score making get rid of this

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.100
repetition and then these two statements happen no matter what whenever I see a

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:18.570
new score I count that I've seen another score and I add the score to the sum.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.170
So now if I compile and fix my syntax errors, I can run the homework scores

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.692
tester. And the homework scores class behaves as it should.
