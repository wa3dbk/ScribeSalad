00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.289
Before, we had negative 2 is less than 2x is less than 10. To get x by itself,

00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:08.555
then, we just need to divide this quantity by 2. Since we want this to stay in

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:12.942
the same relationship to these other two quantities as it is right now. We need

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:17.282
to do the same thing to those quantities as well and we end with negative 1 is

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:22.000
less than x is less than 5. This, of course, translates into the interval

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.382
negative 1, 5. And, we can also plot it on our number line. To check, let's pick

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:32.607
any random value in this region. Let's say, maybe a 0, since that's readily

00:00:32.607 --> 00:00:37.764
available. Let's see. The absolute value of 2 times 0 minus 4 is equal to 0

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:43.468
minus 4. The absolute value of negative 4 is just 4 and 4 is less than 6. So,

00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:44.860
that value works.
