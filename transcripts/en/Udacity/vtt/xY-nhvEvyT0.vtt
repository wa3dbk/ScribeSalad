00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.610
Now that we have an empty database,
let's populate it with some information.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.730
With SQL, we would need to execute
an insert command with all of

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.360
the information we want it to
populate into our database.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.408
Using SQLAlchemy,

00:00:10.408 --> 00:00:13.990
creating a new database is as easy
as creating a new object in Python.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.857
I will be executing these operations
from the Python show, but

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:19.249
they could also be done from
within a Python script.

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.598
We must first import the following
dependencies from SQLAlchemy, and

00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:25.240
the empty database we created,
into our environment.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.458
We will see what they
do in just a second.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:30.120
From our database_setup.py
file that we created,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.100
let's import our base restaurant,
and menu classes.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.510
The create_engine function let's our
program know which database engine we

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.890
want to communicate with.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.770
Then let's bind the engine to the base
class with the following command.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.910
This command just makes the connections
between our class definitions and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.490
the corresponding tables
within our database.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.080
The next thing I'm going to do
is create a sessionmaker object.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.830
This establishes a link of communication
between our code executions and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.760
the engine we just created.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.970
In order to create, read, update or
delete information on our database,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.280
SQLAlchemy executes database
operations via an interface.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.879
It's called a session.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.010
A session allows us to write down all
the commands we want to execute, but

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.490
not send them to the database
until we call a commit.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.210
Here, I'll show you what I mean.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.190
I'm going to create an instance of a
DBSession and call it session for short.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.810
From now on, when I want to
make a change to my database,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.480
I can do it just by calling
a method from within session.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.220
The DBSession object gives
me a staging zone for

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.210
all of the objects loaded into
a database session object.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.730
Any change made to the objects in
the session won't be persisted into

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.530
the database until I
call session.commit.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.120
Now as I promised,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.080
making a new entry in our database is as
easy as making a new object in Python.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.300
Take a look at these three
lines of example code and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.630
watch as I implement them to create
a new restaurant in my database.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.900
Following this example,
I'll make my first restaurant like so.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.180
As you can see, it's just an instance
of my restaurant class with

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.330
a name attribute that I decided
to give it, Pizza Palace.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.790
To persist my new restaurant
into the database,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.890
I must do two more session operations.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.660
First by calling session.add
my first restaurant,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.230
my restaurant object is in the staging
zone to be added to the database.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.990
Then with session.commit it's
now stored to my database.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.350
But how do I know it worked?

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.420
Well, I can also use the session
to interact with my database and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.830
see what's inside of it.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.210
If I execute
session.query(Restaurant).all, I'm

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.300
asking my session to
go into the database,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.795
find the table that corresponds
to the restaurant class and

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:27.735
find all the entires in that table and
return them in a list.

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:30.430
When I run this,
I get a response with something like,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.650
database_setup.Restaurant object at and
some hexadecimal number.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.420
This just let's us know that Python
found a restaurant in our database and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.450
represents it as an object
at this location in memory.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.730
I'm sure you're thinking, well that's
great but how's it useful to me?

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.800
We'll go into more detail about
the query method when we focus on

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.660
reading data out of our database.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.990
So now, let's add a MenuItem
to our Pizza Palace menu.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.860
Since our MenuItems all belong to
a Restaurant, and have a few more

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.330
attributes, we have to provide a bit
more information in our declaration.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.860
I can create a Cheese Pizza by
executing the following command.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.460
Notice that I provided all of the fields
of information for a MenuItem here and

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.330
specify the foreign key relationship
to the object name of my restaurant.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.590
In order for this operation to work,
I didn't have to fill out every entry

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.910
unless I specified it as nullable equal
to false in our database_setup.py file.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.260
Now let's run session.query
MenuItem .all to

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.530
see that an object now exists for
our cheese pizza item, as well.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.770
Now that you know how to
add data to a database,

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.160
it's your turn to get
some practice at it.
