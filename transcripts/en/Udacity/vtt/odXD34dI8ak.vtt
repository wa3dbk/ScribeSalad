00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.550
Let's go ahead and
create our application.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.244
Start with a single view application,
we'll change this later, Next.

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:12.014
And make sure you don't
select Use Cored Data.

00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:14.924
Even though we are going
to use Core Data,

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:20.680
if you select this Xcode will add a lot
of code to your application delegate.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.270
And that's not the place where it
belongs, so don't select that and

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.100
we'll add this code manually later.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.405
We'll call our application
coolnotesswift.

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:32.299
iPhone.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.860
We're all set.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.420
Now let's create a model for
our notes app.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.330
The first step is to add data
model file to our project.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.400
The default name is model, but
you can name it whatever you see fit.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.100
Now, go ahead and create your own.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.050
There seems to be three
things we can create here.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.220
Entities, Fetch Requests,
and Configurations.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.800
Let's start with entities.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.230
Entities are a way of describing
the classes of your model.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.847
Entities will be turn into
Swift classes by Xcode.

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:07.580
And this is actually the only
thing that we will create in here.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.080
Fetch requests can also be
added to the data model.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.530
However, I prefer to keep my
model as simple as possible, so

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.540
we'll create them for code.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.860
Last but not least,
we have this configuration thing.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.862
This is an extremely cool and
powerful tool in Core Data.

00:01:23.862 --> 00:01:27.820
It allows us to save several
different stores at the same time.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.560
For instance, a common combination
is to have a SQL store and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.210
then in-memory store.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.560
The latter behaves as a cache for
objects that might live in the cloud.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.660
A configuration specifies to which
store each entity belongs to.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.710
As you probably already guessed,
configurations are advanced Core Data.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.857
So, let's set them aside for
the time being.

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:51.270
In the next video will start
creating some entities.
