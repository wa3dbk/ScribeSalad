00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.759
So what we're really doing here is simply running a scan over the input.

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:10.290
So the input to the scan is a 1 for each 0 bit and a 0 for each 1 bit,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.533
and that will give us the scatter addresses for the 0 half of the split.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.928
So we're going to scatter this element to an output 0, this element to 1,

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:20.600
this element to 2, and this element to 3.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.808
Notice that the last element of the scan,

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:25.970
with a little bit of extra math because it ends with a 0 element here,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.670
tells us how many 0 bits there are total in the input.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.801
In this case there are four--1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:36.455
Then we can begin with that value to do a second scan

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:41.351
to compute the scatter addresses for the other half of the split, for the 1 bits.

00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:43.583
There are a number of interesting ways to make this faster,

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:49.266
and the most common one is to reduce the total number of passes by taking multiple bits per pass.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:54.396
Four bits per pass and a resulting 16-way split, instead of our 2-way split here,

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:56.231
appears to be fairly common.

00:00:56.231 --> 00:01:01.509
Overall, radix sort is a fairly brute force algorithm, but it's both simple and fast.

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:08.081
Recent GPUs can run radix sort on 32-bit keys at a rate of over a billion keys sorted per second.
