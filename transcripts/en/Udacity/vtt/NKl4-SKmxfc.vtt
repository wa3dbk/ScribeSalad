00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.410
So let's try this, let's make a global variable called sagas that will

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.150
store an array for us, and we'll use this array for storage of saga functions.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.780
Then all we would need in order to have permanent access to each of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.070
these saga functions is to push them into that global array.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.150
At that point, we could choose to access these functions,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.700
even outside the scope they were defined within.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.130
The invocation of those saga functions could actually happen

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.630
after the newSaga function that created them was done running.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.875
So let's try moving these lines of code down here in between the two calls to

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.420
newSaga just to see how it would work.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.780
Let's try running this code with our simulated interpreter again.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.950
So this first line of code will create an array and

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.610
put it in a global variable called sagas.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.450
And this will be where we store each of the saga functions eventually.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.410
Then the line that assigns a new value to the hero variable will run and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.915
create some random string, in this case Boy, to store into the hero variable.

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:57.870
NewSaga is yet

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.360
another assignment so a function object gets placed into the newSaga variable.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.830
And we're ready to do a lookup of newSaga, find this function object, and

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.970
invoke it because of those two parens.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.820
Invoking any function creates a new context, and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.410
that context is where all the lookups will start.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.640
So first we add another variable to that context, foil.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.320
Foil is randomly selected to be ran, and here's the interesting part.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.330
The sagas array is now stored in a global variable,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.570
which means calls to that push should have a lasting effect on it

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.740
that persists even after newSaga has finished running.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.630
What do you think is going to be added into this saga's array as a result of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.250
this line?
