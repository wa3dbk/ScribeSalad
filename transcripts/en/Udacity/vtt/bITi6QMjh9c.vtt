The drinking bird could use a more pleasant outdoor environment. Your job is to

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.830
add a grass texture to the ground plane beneath the bird. Just apply a simple

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.570
color texture. Since the plane is large, please repeat the texture 10 times in

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.450
each direction. See the exercises code for more details. When you're done the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.670
view should look like this. One hint, don't forget about setting the wrap mode.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.330
I didn't do this at first, and it was extremely confusing as to why the texture

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.210
seemed to disappear.
