00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.245
So we want a new, what we're looking for,
to equal the total amount of money that

00:00:04.257 --> 00:00:08.299
Grant can count on getting from his
friends after the second day of sales, so

00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:12.610
that needs to account for the money from
the people who bought on the first day and

00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:16.863
the money from the people who bought on
the second day. We already know from this

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.003
equation that we came up with earlier that
he'll make 36w+22n Dollars from the

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:25.247
initial batch of buyers. So, that means
the equation that we have down here still

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.427
needs to have these terms in it. A couple
of the equations don't, so I'm going to

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.817
cross them off our list. Neither of these
answers includes the money from the people

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.204
bought from Grant on the first day. The
other four answers that are left over All

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:43.326
have 36W and 22N as terms. So that's
great. However this first one only has 36W

00:00:43.338 --> 00:00:48.788
plus 22N. It doesn't have any information
having to do with people who bought on the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.056
second day. So that can't be right, since
we know that Grant will make some money

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:58.260
off of that second round of buyers. To
pick between these three remaining

00:00:58.272 --> 00:01:02.715
equations we need to go through similar
steps for people who buy wipers and people

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:07.125
who buy nozzles as we did in some of the
earlier quizzes to figure out the terms in

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:11.525
this equation for a old. We know that the
price per wiper is still w. And since 51

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:15.970
more people are going to buy wipers we're
going to need to add 51w in. In our

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:21.743
equation. This choice doesn't have 51 w.
It has 50 w. So it can't be right. Then

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:27.366
for the money he'll earn from these 25
extra people buying two nozzles each is

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:32.943
going to be = 25 * 2 n. Since n is the
price per nozzle and they each buy two. If

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:38.091
we simplify 25 * 2 n we actually get 50n.
So we also need to have 50n, in our

00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:43.277
answer. Both of these last 2 choices have
36w, and 22n in them, and they also have

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.530
51w and 50n, so that means they are both
correct. The only difference between them,

00:01:48.638 --> 00:01:53.549
is the order that the terms are arranged
in. This is just another case, of the

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:58.167
communative property of addition. Awesome
job! I know this was a really tough quiz

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.734
so great job for getting through it.
