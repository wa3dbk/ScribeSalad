00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.087
The center is at negative 1 comma negative 2 and the radius is 3, the square

00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:10.726
root of 9. Great work if you got these two right. Now, if you made a mistake,

00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:14.100
that's okay. Just keep in mind that the center is always the opposite sign of

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.540
what's in the parenthesis here and here. We have positive 1 here and positive 2

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.933
here. So the h must be negative 1 and the k must be negative 2.
