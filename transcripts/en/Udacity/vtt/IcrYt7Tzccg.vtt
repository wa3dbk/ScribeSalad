00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.386
You just saw one type of dependent samples t-test, where we test out and

00:00:03.386 --> 00:00:07.666
measure samples from two different populations. In the case of the last

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.150
example, the populations were the number of errors made typing the 20-word text

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.760
message within 30 seconds on each keyboard configuration. This is called the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.085
repeated measures design. And the null hypothesis, is that these two population

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:25.178
means will be the same. Before we finish this lesson, I'll tell you about two

00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:30.400
other types of dependent samples t-tests. One is a longitudinal design, where

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.535
we measure a variable at one point in time and then we measure the same

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:39.086
variable for the same sample at a later point in time. And we want to know if

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:43.748
there's a significant difference between the variable at time 1 and time 2. So

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:47.096
the null hypothesis will be exactly the same symbolically as for repeated

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:51.719
measures design. Only with this design we're putting a lot of time in between

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.030
measuring the variables. And then, a third type of dependent sample's design is

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.270
a pretest posttest, where we measure a variable, implement some kind of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.672
treatment, and then measure the same variable for the same sample after the

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:10.636
treatment to see if there was a significant effect due to the treatment. Again,

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:14.662
the null hypothesis is the same, that the variable won't significantly change

00:01:14.662 --> 00:01:19.614
before the treatment and after the treatment. You'll see examples of these two

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:25.008
types of designs in problem set 10. Great job. T-tests are pretty complicated,

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:30.062
so now dive deeper with Dr. Laraway. He's going to go into more detail on these

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:33.478
concepts and then go through a full one sample t-test so you can get a lot of

00:01:33.478 --> 00:01:37.650
practice and really understand how to use these.
