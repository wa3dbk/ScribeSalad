00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.059
For example of pre and post conditions think about an operation for

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.689
taking a square root. In English we might say something as far as

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.060
a precondition is concerned, the argument had better be a non-negative number.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.170
As far as a post condition is confirmed something like the square of

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.870
the computed results must equal the argument. That's a little bit backwards way

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.810
of thinking about things but in fact it is a true expression of equality okay,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.440
that must, must be the case if square root has the meaning we expect it to have.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.700
If we were to express these particular constraints in OCL, we might do

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.220
them in the context of the built-in class reel. And having,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.540
adding an operation called square root, that returns as a result, a real answer.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.170
The precondition is that the argument which is, in, in this case,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.950
is the number we're taking a square root of had better be better than or

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.490
equal to zero. And the post condition is that

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.900
the argument should be equal to the result when multiplied by itself.
