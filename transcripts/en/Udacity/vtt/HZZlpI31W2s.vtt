00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
This course is about exactly these challenging problems.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.290
Problems that are really, really tough for computers to solve.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.470
But it is also a course about what to do with those challenging problems.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.950
So how you can solve them using a computer despite them being very hard to solve.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.480
Now, the part of computer science that deals with challenging problems

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.970
is called theoretical computer science.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.600
The first part of theoretical computer science that we will be looking at is called complexity theory.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.410
And complexity theory is the science of how much, or more specifically, how much resources.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.480
So time, or memory, and also other resources a computer will need to solve a given problem.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.050
The other part of theoretical computer science that we'll be looking at is called computability.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.040
And computability asks the more fundamental question.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.820
Computability asks, can a computer solve a given problem at all,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.660
given as much time and as much memory as you want?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.680
Now, this course will be mostly looking at complexity theory,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.000
but we'll also do computability for 2 reasons:

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.170
First of all, it kind of belongs in the whole picture,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.640
to say what computers can do and cannot do.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
And the other reason is that many problems that fall into the area of computability

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.860
are actually very relevant, and it's important to understand computability

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.600
to know what is doable and what isn't.

00:01:20.600 --> 99:59:59.000
And it's also important to understand computability to know what's possible in general and what isn't.
