00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
All right, so to do the last little bit of this proof to show that 3-colorability is NP hard,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we're going to show that if we had the ability to solve 3-colorability problems in polynomial time,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
then we could solve three SAT problems in polynomial time as well,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and so what we need to be able to do to show that is if you walk up to me with any 3-CNF formula,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I can quickly turn it into a 3-colorability problem, which is going to be a graph

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
such that that graph is 3 colorable if and only if the original formula

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the 3-CNF formula that were given is satisfiable.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So CNF here just means conjunctive normal form.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's just that form that I showed you before where the formula is the n of a bunch of clauses

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and each clause is the or of three literals and each literal is either variable or its negation,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
not the variable, so you walk up to me with 3-CNF problem,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I turn that into a 3-colorability problem that can be colored if and only if the formula is satisfiable.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Sounds like an interesting challenge. So let's get to it. What we're going to be doing is building a graph.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We'll start off by creating some nodes with one node for every possible literal in the formula.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So that's the k different variables of let's say this, just to be concrete.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This formula that we come to has k variables and s clauses and we're going to add three more nodes.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We'll call them true, false, and slack. I'm going to connect up the nodes initially as follows.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Each literal will be connected to slack including true and false

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and we're going to connect true and false to each other.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What that means because there's a little triangle here and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we're trying see whether or not it's 3-colorable.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The only way that this thing could be 3 colorable is if these three are given three different colors.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So just for concreteness, let's say that the color that slack gets is red.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The color that true gets is blue, true blue and the color that false gets is black, black. False won.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
All right, so the graph that we have so far has the property that each of these literals is

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
going to have be colored either true or false, blue or black, if we're going to 3 color the whole graph.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So that's good, that kind of make it seem like they're actually getting truth assignments.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We have to be a little careful though because literal Vâ‚  and literal not Vâ‚  can't both be true

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and they can't both be false but that's an easy thing to fix in a graph colorability problem.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We just connect them with an edge.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So we add one edge for each variable connecting the pair of literals

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that can't both be true and both be false.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now what happens is the only way that we can 3 color this is if each variable is given a blue for

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
either the variable and black for its negation or black for the variable

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and blue for the negation and that's like a truth assignment.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
A true/false assignment to that variable..

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So any possible truth assignment, corresponds to a 3 coloring.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Any possible 3 coloring, corresponds to the truth assignment.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So far we're in really good shape as far as capturing the idea of the physics of a SAT problem.
