00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.360
In this case, I think it's best to make the speed of the van be the variable.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.655
We're going to let this equal x. Now, we could let the bus be the variable x,

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:11.835
and I know it's not that clear since we need to find the speed of each of the

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:17.684
vehicles. But we do know that the bus travels ten miles per hour slower than

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:23.354
the van. So, if we let x be the van, we can easily write an expression for the

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:26.000
rate of our bus.
