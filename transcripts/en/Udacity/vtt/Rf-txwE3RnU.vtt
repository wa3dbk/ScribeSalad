00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.110
Well if we add 32 on the left side of the equation, then we need to subtract 32

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.255
from the same side. This should make a total of 0 on the left hand side of the

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:16.548
equation. And we'd be left with 2x squared like here, minus 16x here, plus 33

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:22.920
here. This is why these two equations are exactly the same. The other way that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.780
we can think about it is that if we add 32 on the right hand side of the

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.023
equation, then we add 32 on the left hand side of the equation. We could just

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:37.850
subtract the 32 to get the y alone, and we wind up with this equation. Since we

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.134
want the equation to be in the form y equals, it's best to go ahead an subtract

00:00:42.134 --> 00:00:48.220
32, from the same side that we add 32. We can just skip the step of adding 32

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.620
on both sides, so long as we subtract the 32, since we added 32 here.
