00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now let's use the computer to learn what happens with different harvest rates.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If we would not be harvesting at all, we would expect to see something like an exponential growth

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
at the beginning, but after a while the amount of fish would approach the maximum carrying capacity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you were harvesting too strongly, you would expect the number of fish

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to quickly go down to zero and then of course stay zero--that's clearly over fishing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, implement this using the forward Euler method and make sure that you stop harvesting

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
when the amount of fish reaches zero.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
All constants that you need are already set up in the code.

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You only have to provide the implementation of the forward Euler method to fill the array called fish.
