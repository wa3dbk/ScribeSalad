00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.664
We typically report the results of one-way ANOVA like this. Our F-statistic as

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:10.400
a function of our two degrees of freedom, between and within, our p-value and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.309
eta squared. Note that when we're doing ANOVA by hand, we can't find the exact

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.778
p-value. This is the same as with the T test. We only know that our p-value is

00:00:21.778 --> 00:00:25.810
less than 0.05, our alpha level, because our f-statistic is greater than the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.922
f-critical value. If we're using software, it'll be the same thing, except we

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:37.154
can calculate the exact p-value. Notice that we've frequently used small

00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:42.186
samples in our examples and problem sets. However, we wouldn't normally use

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:47.218
such small samples, especially in real research. But if we use large samples,

00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:52.162
we can't do ANOVA by hand. That would just take too long. We would use software

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:56.010
instead. When we use software, we don't care as much about the intermediate

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.640
steps. Really, we just want to compare the p-value with alpha. We know that if

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.656
p is less than alpha, we'll reject the null. Since using software is so

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:09.562
essential to doing statistical tests, we're going to provide you with some

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:15.410
software output for you to see and analyze, so that you get familiar with it.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.162
This is real data that Doctor Laraway collected from his psychology students at

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:24.842
San Jose State University. There are 188 students total, 90 of which were

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:31.204
freshman, 44 sophomores, 23 juniors, and 31 seniors. And he asked them to

00:01:31.204 --> 00:01:36.476
self-report how many days every month they drink caffeine. You can already see

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:39.689
that the number of days that seniors drink caffeine is higher than any of the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.675
others. But it also has a pretty large standard deviation, as does that for

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:50.692
juniors. We want to know if at least one group of college students drinks more

00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:56.102
caffeine than the others. Doctor Larawayused the statistical program SPSS to

00:01:56.102 --> 00:02:02.102
answer this. Here's his ANOVA table output. According to this, which of the

00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:03.470
following would we do?
