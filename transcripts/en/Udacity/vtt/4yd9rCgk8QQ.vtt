00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.080
Power-ups are a classic game mechanic,
easily recognized by

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.117
anyone who has played a video
game in the last, actually ever.

00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:11.288
Well, the first power-up was probably
introduced back in 1980 with Pac-Man.

00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:14.866
And if there were power-ups
in video games before that,

00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:19.346
I neither confirm nor deny that I'm
old enough to have collected them.

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:23.059
But anyway, a power-up is just an object
that gives the player some ability or

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:26.870
other benefit, like super speed,
additional ammo, an extra life.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.750
You get the idea.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.220
Of course, it's up to you whether or
not they appear in your game.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.113
What they do, how and
when you let players collect them, and

00:00:34.113 --> 00:00:35.430
there are a lot of options.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.110
You can place them randomly or
at spots you preselect.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.522
You can spawn them when an enemy dies or
a puzzle is completed.

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:46.280
You can make it so a player collects
power-ups just by touching them.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.512
Or require some other, more involved
process, like smashing a chest, or

00:00:50.512 --> 00:00:51.660
digging out a wall.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.330
There's certainly nothing that says you
have to have power-ups in your game.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.711
But they really have
stood the test of time.

00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:00.386
I think most game players would
agree that they add something to

00:01:00.386 --> 00:01:01.150
the experience.
