00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.246
Here's what it might look like. That is, we use some kind of collection class,

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:08.740
a hash table or a set or an array to hold all the pairs of associated objects.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.720
Each of the columns is going to correspond to an attribute in an instance and

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.980
we have one instance for each of the links in the original association.
