In the last lesson we learned that linear factors of polynomials tell us about

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:09.907
x-intercepts of the graphs that go along with those polynomials. So if we have

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:14.032
an equation like y equals x minus 3 times x plus 1 It's going to have x

00:00:14.032 --> 00:00:18.655
intercepts of three, zero, and negative one zero. So this is a big part of our

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:23.168
motivation for talking about factoring so much. If we can factor a polynomial

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:27.392
then we already know all of the places where it hits the x axis. We learned

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:31.872
before the linear factors of a polynomial tell us about where the polynomial

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:36.057
hits the x axis. On the last quiz, we learned that x squared plus one is not

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:40.613
factorable, however, I'm going to expand our statement about x squared plus one

00:00:40.613 --> 00:00:44.761
and tell you that it is not only not factorable, but it actually has no real

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:49.221
linear factors. I know that we're not totally clear on what this means yet, and

00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:53.488
you'll learn in a few lessons. But let's just explore this briefly for now,

00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:57.915
touch on it a bit. Considering this, how many places do you think on the graph

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:00.769
of y equals x squared plus one touches the x axis?
