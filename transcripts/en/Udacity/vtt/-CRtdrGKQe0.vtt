00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.009
I will solve objective
three in this next video,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:07.273
by creating a webpage when the user
visits localhost:/8080/restaurants/new.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.900
This page will contain a form
that a user can fill out

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.370
to create a new restaurant.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.790
The form will then send a post
request to the server, and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.020
create a new restaurant
entry in the database.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.590
Once you've attempted this challenge,
proceed to the solution video.
