00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:02.624
As you are moving around between apps,

00:00:02.624 --> 00:00:05.456
you probably notice that 
from a user perspective,

00:00:05.456 --> 00:00:08.639
Android doesn't announce changes
in app state. It doesn't announce,

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.835
that it's low in memory or ask users
to close apps to free up resources.

00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:16.954
In fact, it does everything it can to make
the resource limitation to the device,

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:18.761
invisible to the user.

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:21.970
That means keeping 
the foreground app running smoothly,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.940
and switching between apps seamless,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.262
and that means killing apps 
in the background.

00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:31.493
And it does that 
if it needs their resources

00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:34.512
to make sure that the foreground apps
can continue to run.

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:38.546
So we know that as soon as your app
is visible, its lifetime is as perilous

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.437
as that of a Stark at the Red Wedding:

00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:43.889
likely to die without notice, 
but ready to return from the dead.

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:46.596
That tells us some very important things

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:49.219
about how our app should behave
to be good citizens

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.138
and provide a great user experience.

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:54.288
&gt;From a system perspective, 
onPause and onStop are signals

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.299
that our app may be killed eminently.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.260
So we need to clean up any resources
that need an orderly tear down

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.387
such as closing any 
open connections or sockets.
