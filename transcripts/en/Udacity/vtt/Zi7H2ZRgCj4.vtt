00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.700
We've already done a lot of the steps required to solve the 3-SAT problem in this course.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.930
We've seen how to represent 3-SAT, the input that is.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:18.720
We've also seen how to apply preprocessing rules so that it's a bit easier to solve after that,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.730
and these are mainly in problem sets 2 and 4.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.720
Now, what we're going to do is construct a search tree

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.780
to find if the given instance has a satisfying assignment.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.720
So, you're going to code up a function solve&lt;u&gt;3SAT&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.120
that should return none if the given instance of 3-SAT has no satisfying assignment,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.630
and otherwise it should return that satisfying assignment.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.970
Now, the search tree technique that we're going to use is as follows.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.710
When you take any clause that is not satisfied,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.860
and if all of the variables have already been set,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.940
then there is no possible solution anymore, so simply return none.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.510
Otherwise, we branch into at most 3 cases where in each case a different variable is set

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.890
so that the clause can hopefully become satisfied.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.090
The first variable is set so that the clause becomes satisfied

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.240
and we don't do anything with the other variables.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.650
The first variable is set so that the clause does not become satisfied,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.760
and the second one is set so that it becomes satisfied,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.650
and then we don't do anything with the third variable.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.240
Finally, the first and second variables are set so that the clause does not become satisfied,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.610
and the third one is set so that it does become satisfied.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.070
These are the 3 possible cases with 3 sets

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.330
since there are at most 3 variables in any clause.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.190
Now, you can write any additional functions required to solve this problem

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.960
or break this up into sub-parts, and I'd recommend doing that;

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.740
it should make this much simpler because it can get to be quite a bit of code here.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.930
So, have fun solving 3-SAT.

00:01:45.930 --> 99:59:59.000
I know we've already done a lot of the steps.
