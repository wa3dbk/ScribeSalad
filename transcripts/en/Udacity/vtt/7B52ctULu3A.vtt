00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.440
To see how that is really done, let's
just look at how unique started for

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:03.950
example.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.980
So you provide a User ID and
your password.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.900
We use the User ID to select
the entry in the password file for

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.000
this user that we're talking about.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.470
The salt is stored here.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.530
The hash value's stored here, isn't it?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.660
This is sort of the data
structure we keep.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.340
To log in,
you're going to supply your password, so

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.110
we start on this side later on.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.300
So this is what is set up initially for
create the user account or

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.420
set up the password.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.380
At that time, we determine the salt and
computer hash value and

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.180
things like that.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.930
So later on a user comes
types the password.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.320
Well, they're saying who they are.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.360
You give your user id, your log in name.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.490
Based on that, we're going to
find the hash value and the salt.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.064
So the salt and the password are going
to be put through this hash function.

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:52.256
And it's slow because if
somebody's doing brute force,

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:53.885
it pays to slow them down.

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:57.195
So we passed these two things
through the hash function.

00:00:57.195 --> 00:01:01.781
So this is typed by the user based on
the claim by the user, who they are.

00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:05.555
This is what we find in the file that
we have, where we store the salt value.

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:08.015
So the two are passed as input to this.

00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:10.828
The result is compared
with a stored hash value.

00:01:10.828 --> 00:01:15.580
If the two match then we allow
authentication is successful.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.869
If they don't match,
then authentication fails.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.072
So this is what happens when we have
makers of salt to deal with different

00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:26.435
users making the same password and
the result having the same hash value.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:27.730
And that would be a problem.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.776
When you add salt, the rainbow based,
rainbow table based attack,

00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:34.098
think about what would happen to that.
