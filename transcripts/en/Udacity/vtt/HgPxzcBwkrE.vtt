Hey again.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.440
So it turns out that JP might not have
been that crazy when he asked for

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.930
offline access.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.790
So I have been getting some complaints
from some of our users about erratic

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.480
behavior in shopping marts.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.190
In some stores, for whatever reason,
when they don't have internet access

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.250
a user will make changes at then
the next time they open up the app,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.200
those changes won't be recorded.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.750
Could you maybe look into fixing this?
