00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
With this assignment, we want you to write a function create_tour

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that takes as input a list of nodes and outputs a graph

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
as a list of tuples representing edges between nodes

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that have an Eulerian tour.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For example, if nodes was 1, 2, 3,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
one possible solution is a graph that has an edge between 1 and 3,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and edge between 1 and 2, and an edge between 2 and 3.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We've also provided some simple testing code,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which you can use to see if you're function is working properly.
