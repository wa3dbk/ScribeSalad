00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.779
So as a programming exercise, I want you to take this code

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:07.217
and tile both foo and bar using thread blocks that have 128 threads

00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:12.284
and tiling, a tile size of 128 elements. Okay?

00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:13.948
And as you'll see if you look at the code,

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:16.926
we've structured it so that it'll be safe for you to ignore the boundary effects

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:20.300
at the beginning and end of the arrays, the input and output arrays.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.899
We're only calling this on a portion of the code in the middle of the array.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.594
But of course you can't ignore the boundary effects

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:28.772
that happen at the boundaries between thread blocks.

00:00:28.772 --> 00:00:32.575
So I'm looking for the percentage of time of the non-tiled version of the code

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:34.778
that your tiled version takes.

00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:38.850
So for example, if your code ran exactly as fast as the non-tiled version,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.582
then it would be 100% of the time,

00:00:41.582 --> 00:00:46.578
and if your code ran twice as fast as the non-tiled version, then it would take 50% of the time.

00:00:46.578 --> 00:00:51.128
Give me the percentage of time for both foo and bar after you've done the tiling.
