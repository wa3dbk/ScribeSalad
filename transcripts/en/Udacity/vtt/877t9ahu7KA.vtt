00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.180
Here, x would equal 4 3rds. Nice thinking if you got this number. Now, if this

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.020
gave you some trouble, that's okay. We haven't had a lot of practice rewriting

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.535
numbers with different bases, so let's see how it works. I know that both 27

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:20.275
and 81 are the result of raising 3 to a certain power. For example, 3 cubed is

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:27.775
27 and 3 to the fourth is 81. Notice too that now I have the same base. I have

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:32.552
a 3 here, and a 3 here. But before I do anything, let's combine these two

00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:37.820
exponents. When we raise a power to a power, you multiply these two together.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.232
This is how we get 3 to the 3x equals 3 to the fourth power. Now, since these

00:00:43.232 --> 00:00:48.053
two bases match, we set these exponents equal to one another. So we'll have 3x

00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:52.832
set equal to 4 here, and then we'll divide both sides by 3 to get x equals 4

00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:59.385
3rds. And if you check this in a calculator or by hand, you'll definitely see

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:05.304
that 27 raised to the 4 3rds equals 81. We know this is true since the cube

00:01:05.304 --> 00:01:12.170
root of 27 equals 3. And 3 to the fourth power is 81. So yes, our answer checks

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.300
and we can be sure that it's correct.
