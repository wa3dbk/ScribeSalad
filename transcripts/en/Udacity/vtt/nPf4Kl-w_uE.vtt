00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.713
Let's take another look at the original ellipse we first encountered at the

00:00:02.713 --> 00:00:07.064
start of the lesson. We knew that this ellipse was centered at the origin 0, 0,

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:10.908
in that we moved two units left and right to get a point and three units up and

00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:17.215
down from the center to get two more points. But, not every ellipse is going to

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:22.220
be centered at the origin. Sometimes they can be elsewhere. Just like we could

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.038
shift circles, we could also shift ellipses. So, if I wanted to graph this one,

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:33.310
I would notice that the graph would shift up one whole unit. Remember, when we

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.620
replace y with y minus a number, the graph really shifts up that many units.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.120
And instead of just shifting up one unit, I could also shift it up two units.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.580
We could shift it up three units, four units or even five units. The key thing

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.630
to remember is that this sign is the opposite of the direction the ellipse

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.380
moves. So now let's say if we are looking at our original lips and we want to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.722
move it down instead of subtracting from y we'll add to y. So if we add 1 to y,

00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:10.239
we'll get a shift downward. Our entire orange ellipse moved down one unit. And

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:14.280
we get this new blue ellipse. And I could continue shifting it further down by

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.737
adding a larger number, like two, or three, or four and so on. So we know

00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:26.202
adding or subtracting the y makes a graph, or an ellipse move up or down. So to

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:31.858
move a graph left or right, we'll have to add or subtract to x. So again,

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:35.752
notice that I have my original graph, and this time I'm going to subtract 1

00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:42.244
from x. If I subtract one from x, I'll get this graph. Notice that all the

00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:46.820
points on our ellipse shifted one unit to the right. Here's just a few of the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.502
points that you can see that all shifted one unit to the right. And if we

00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:55.030
wanted to, we could shift two units to the right, three units to the right, or

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.388
even four. And again, notice that this is a subtraction sign. So if it's a

00:02:00.388 --> 00:02:06.997
negative here, we're really moving to the right. But if it's a positive here,

00:02:06.997 --> 00:02:11.875
we're really moving to the left. So this new equation would be our original

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:17.485
orange ellipse, just shifted one unit to the left. And notice that we have plus

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:22.962
1. A plus 1 really shifted it to the left. So plus 2 would shift it 2 units to

00:02:22.962 --> 00:02:26.210
the left. And plus 3 would shift it 3 units to the left.
