00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
Another way to perform traffic engineering is with

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.890
Multipath Routing, where an operator can establish multiple

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.446
paths in advance. This approach applies both to

00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:13.590
intra-domain routing, and inter-domain routing. The way this

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.309
is done in intra-domain routing is to set

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.620
link weights such that multiple paths of equal

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.370
cost exist between two nodes in the graph.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.980
This approach is called equal cost multi path.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.240
Thus traffic will be split across paths that

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.990
have equal costs through the network. A source

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.660
router might also be able to change the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.780
fraction of traffic that's sent along each one

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.300
of these paths. Sending for example 35% along

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.950
the top path and 65% along the bottom

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.780
path. It might even be able to do

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.160
this based on the level of congestion that's observed

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.790
along these paths. The way that the router would do this is by having

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.089
multiple forwarding table entries with different [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.468
stops for outgoing packets to the same destination.
