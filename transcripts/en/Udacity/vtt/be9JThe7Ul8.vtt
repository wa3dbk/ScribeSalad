00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.768
In another lesson later on we're going to be looking at architectural views.

00:00:03.768 --> 00:00:08.189
But to anticipate that I'll just mention that

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.190
architectural description is not just a diagram, it's a set of decisions. And

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.950
in fact the, in order to fully communicate that set of decisions,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.340
many diagrams and/or textual documents might be produced. We call

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.270
these architectural views. Because the set of decisions may be large, and

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.880
there may be many different aspects to it, okay? Over the course of time various

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.218
different kinds of diagrams and tables have been developed and found useful and

00:00:38.218 --> 00:00:43.100
so we want to be aware of what those are so if you are confronted by a situation

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.040
where you need to convey some aspects of the architecture, you have you're aware

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.030
of the various diagrams and, and textural processes you could apply.
