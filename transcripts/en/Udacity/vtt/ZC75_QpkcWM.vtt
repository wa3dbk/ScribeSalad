There are actually a ton of different right answers for what h of x could be.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.350
The actual equation I graphed over here is h of x equals three halves x cubed.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.918
Instead of this three halves though, you could have any coefficient. Maybe let's

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:20.616
call that coefficient A for now. That's between the values of 1 and 3. We want

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:25.689
h of x to be stretched taller than f of x but not quite as tall as g of x.
