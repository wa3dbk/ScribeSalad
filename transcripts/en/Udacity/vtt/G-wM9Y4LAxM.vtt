00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.368
Before we can write any code, we need to figure out what the expected values

00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:10.065
are. This green rectangle is what our rectangle grows to. This point should be

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:20.936
at 45 minus 20 and 90 minus 20. So our expected value of x, would be 25. And

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:25.956
your expected value of y would be 70. The width would be 60 plus 20 on one

00:00:25.956 --> 00:00:34.189
side, and 20 on the other side, so 100. And the height would be 90 plus 20 at

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:40.227
the top and 20 at the bottom, so 130. So in the test program, I would create my

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:45.636
new rectangle and I would print out my expected value for x. And remember, this

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:49.752
is just a comment. And expected value for y, expected value for width, and the

00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:54.496
expected value for height. I want to compare these to the actual values.

00:00:54.496 --> 00:01:02.975
box.getX, gets me the, actual value, of X for box. Box.getY gets the actual

00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:08.269
value for Y for the box. And I do the same thing for width and heighth. Now I

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:12.554
can run my test program. I had a couple of syntax errors, so I just fixed those

00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:20.066
up, and now I can actually run it. And I printed, 45, 25, 90, 70, 60, 100, 90,

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:31.046
and 130. Looks like the actual values don't match my expectations. What went

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:37.160
wrong? It looks like I created the rectangle and then printed out the actual

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.942
and expected values without actually calling grove. And now if I run it again,

00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:55.564
I get the actual is 70, expected is 70, 100, 100, 130, 130, and 25, 25. That's

00:01:55.564 --> 00:02:00.708
much better. Based on these test results, I'd say the grow method works about,

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:03.449
the way it says it will.
