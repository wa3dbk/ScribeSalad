00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.775
So, let's look at the speed versus power

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:06.028
versus weight versus cost quiz answer. We were

00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:07.884
asked, which one of these is the worst

00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:12.348
laptop processor? The crawlium, slowium, laptium, fastium, hotium, and

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:15.408
burnium, where performance is growing, the but the

00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:18.672
battery life is decreasing, the weight is growing, and

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:21.910
the cost is growing. Well, most of these

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.950
are actually not very good processors. Laptium seems reasonable.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.302
It gives you good performance. Five hour battery life is

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:32.216
not too bad, four ounces for the processor you can build

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:35.390
a laptop with that, and about $100 for the processor.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.100
The laptop will probably be about $1,000, so that's fine. Going

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.940
with the slowium, it's not too bad. It's going to be

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.880
half as fast. But you can still do a lot of

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.104
things with it. It gives you excellent battery life. Possibly even

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:51.062
a lighter laptop, and it's going to be cheap. So, these two

00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:55.570
are probably reasonable laptop processors. Fastium is a lot

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.630
faster. Very little battery life. You'll probably have to keep

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.970
it plugged in. It's relatively heavy, so this is

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.660
going to be a very heavy laptop. And it's going to be

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.910
more expensive, but it's still not an unreasonable laptop.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.046
So clearly, the designs in the middle are actually better

00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:13.544
laptop processors than the ones on the extremes. So, we

00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:16.360
really have to do, is decide whether the Crawlium or

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.800
the Burnium is the worst laptop processor. Here we have

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.400
something that is about one tenth of a performance of

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.110
a reasonable laptop processor. Extremely good battery life. Probably you

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.780
could make this as big as a cell phone, and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.738
very, very cheap. So, this is not such a bad

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:35.300
processor. There are still things you can do with it,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.510
and some people might want a lot of this, of

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.404
this kind. In contrast, here we have something that has

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:44.900
four times the performance of the Laptium. The

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.700
battery life of all of two minutes. 20 pounds

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.930
for the processor including the heat sink and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.386
so on. So, probably this is not really going to

00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:56.480
be portable. And it's going to be extremely, extremely

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.812
expensive. So, as you can see, the highest performance

00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:04.960
processor here is actually the worst laptop processor.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.030
So as you can see, between the crawlium and

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.240
the burnium, here we have something that is very slow but also very light and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.511
has a long battery life. Which is

00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:17.307
probably better than having something that is significantly

00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:20.008
faster with almost no battery life, spinal

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.731
injuries from carrying it around and extremely expensive,

00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:28.980
so when you drop it, you drop $15,000 worth of laptop. And you will drop it.
