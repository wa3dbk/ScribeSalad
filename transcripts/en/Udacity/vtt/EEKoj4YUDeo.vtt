00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.880
The IPsec header has an IPsec sequence
number designed to prevent replay.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.170
It is used only if Is used, or the
authentication option in ESP is used.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.400
A sliding window of size n,
which should be at least 32, is used.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.110
That is, although packets
may arrive out of order,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.180
the sequence numbers should be
within the window of size n.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.860
More specifically, when a packet
arrives, if its sequence number is

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.070
smaller than the smallest number
of the window, it is rejected.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.220
If the number is greater than
the largest sequence number

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.230
of the sliding window,
then the packet is accepted, and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.850
the window it advances
to discover this number.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.670
If the sequence number
falls in the window,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.200
it is checked to see if the sequence
number have been seen before.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.510
If yes, it is also rejected.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.520
If not, it is accepted and the number
is recorded as having been seen.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.920
That's how we reject duplicate packets.
