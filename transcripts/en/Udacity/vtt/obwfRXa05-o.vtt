00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.290
Well Kirk, I appreciate you taking
the time to be with us today.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.050
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.629
&gt;&gt; You're the Chief Technology Officer
at Wellcentive,

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:09.770
a local company here in Atlanta.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.760
And the company has
an interesting founding story.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.540
Could you briefly tell us about that?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.598
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:22.150
Two brother-in-laws were really
talking over Christmas drinks.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.041
One of the brother-in-laws was Dr.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:29.320
Paul Taylor, and
he was producing reports in Excel for

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.330
payers, trying to summarize his
own quality using claims data.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.430
And it was just way too cumbersome,
very difficult, and inaccurate,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.500
and the other brother in law was
working at Patient Care Technologies.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.780
Was a software designer and
they realized,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.730
hey this is a trend that
really needs to happen.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.290
Physicians need to be paid
on quality long term.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.100
And there's absolutely a market here.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.540
They stayed small for four or five
years, invested a lot in the product.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.040
Delivered real results to significant
customers in the Michigan area.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.700
I joined about three years ago, and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.990
I had a unique history that followed
along with their path, as well.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.650
I worked at MedQuist and M*Modal.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.720
There I saw 20 terabytes of rich
text files of pure narrative, and

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.140
we said,
we have to tap into that information.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.970
But natural language processing and the
different context that you might look at

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.090
that narrative text in, offered many,
many challenges that I felt would

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.640
take a long time to really to get to
the value that I wanted to get to.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.250
So, I then looked at a company called
Outcomes Health Informations Solutions,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.500
and what they did,
was they literally put nurses on site,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.670
picked up a paper medical record,
scanned it, uploaded it to another bank

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.780
of nurses that would read the paper,
and then essentially abstract

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.190
the information to answer a specific
question that a payer would have.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.560
And payers would pay $80 a chart for
that process to happen.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.840
It was a mess.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.240
An absolute nightmare of
a workflow that led to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.160
lower data quality and higher cost.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.160
The whole time I was there, I said,
can't we get this data out of the EHR?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.800
And lo and behold, three years ago,
I found this company, Wellcentive,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.740
that was working on exactly that.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.880
&gt;&gt; Well that's a great story.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.460
In lesson ten we'll talk a bit more
about feature selection out of natural

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.750
language records.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.890
And I guess these nurses were the first
generation of technology for doing that.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.925
&gt;&gt; Yep.
Absolutely.

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:43.655
&gt;&gt; So let's segue forward to today.

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:47.965
Today you're gathering data from
lots of doctor's practices and EMRs.

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:49.085
Can you give us those numbers?

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.825
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have about 1,000 practices,
8,000 physicians.

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:57.805
We have over 2,500 interfaces pumping
data into our data center every day.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.380
We process about 200 million
clinical data points every month.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.530
And one of my favorite stats is that
we have sent 178 million transactions

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.200
to payers that have resulted in
a value based reimbursement payment.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.660
And it's all based on clinical quality.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.940
Okay, that sounds like a lot of
stuff from a lot of sources.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.570
How do you do it?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.250
&gt;&gt; That's easier asked than answered,
but

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.760
it really comes down to being aggressive
with respect to seeking out the data.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.440
So that means that for our customers,
what we need to do is we need to go to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.180
them and say, you know what, I don't
care what format of the data you have.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.600
Your system exports data somehow,
some way, it's just a file format.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.690
People have been parsing files for
a long, long time.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.000
So we just roll up our sleeves,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.950
we have a flexible platform that allows
us to administer many different types of

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.960
format parsing,
many different types of protocols.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.700
And it creates a queue of processing and
enterprise servers bus of processing

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.870
that allows us to process and interpret
that data as we hit our application, and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.040
put that data into a structured
form in an application side.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.380
&gt;&gt; And I want to emphasize that you're
not just collecting quality metrics,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.420
which the students should know are
relatively standardized at this point.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.360
But you're collecting
clinical data from EMRs.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.630
And of course, by now,
the students have already seen that.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.740
They've seen some of the things you do.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.760
How do you normalize and

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.210
standardize that clinical data when
it comes from 200 different EMRs?

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.200
&gt;&gt; The key to that is being
what we say purpose driven.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.140
We don't try to boil the ocean and

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.630
standardize every data point
that we find in each document.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.370
We work with the provider organization
to say what are your clinical

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.940
quality goals?

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.310
And how are you going to
be paid based on this data?

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.400
And we specifically look at all the file
formats that they give us, and we pick

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.780
out the pieces of data that relate
to those clinical quality measures.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.470
And so that, first,
simplifies the problem and

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.610
allows us to really focus on data
quality within that specific domain.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.020
Then we essentially maintain
a dictionary of all code sets.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.700
And we have over 2.2 million
mappings that we have curated

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.850
over the past eight years that relate
the customers custom dictionaries

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.600
to all the national standard
dictionaries that exist out there.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.460
&gt;&gt; Well,
what about the patient in all of this?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.120
This is clinical data from the EMR.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.570
How do you manage the obvious
privacy and security concerns?

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.340
&gt;&gt; Well, it's very important.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.830
And I actually respect,
a lot, the high tech act.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.740
When we went into our first HIPAA risk
assessment, you get pretty nervous.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.170
But as you go through it you realize
that it's a very healthy process.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.660
They have a long checklist of
about 170 something regulations.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.170
That as we went through it, we just
made sure that we hit on each of those

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.120
and that we're diligent and respectful
internally to our organization.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.260
Our people deal with
clinical data all day long.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.580
They're helping our customers
measure clinical quality.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.570
And so quite a bit of education within
the company about how to handle that

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.840
data responsibly is required.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.450
&gt;&gt; So, a patient like the make believe
chronic, multi chronic disease patient,

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.100
Marla, that we've created for
this course.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.440
Whose going to lots of
different specialists,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.700
becomes a real challenge to
know where is her record?

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.550
Whose caring for her?

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.050
And how do you define quality
in a patient like that?

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
That's very, very tricky.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.800
So one of the biggest
problems that Marla can pose,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.760
is not going to the doctor at all.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.310
And how do you know if you're
missing clinical data,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.490
maybe you just don't
have that interface?

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.450
Maybe you don't have that relationship
with that doctor that she went to see?

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.500
So, I think what's happening right now
is provider organizations are a single

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.660
legal structure or

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.010
entity, they're starting to
solve this problem internally.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.710
And it goes to some other topics
like the roll out of direct and

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.170
the roll of HIEs, is if you're solving
this problem internally to that

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.360
provider organization, that legal
structure, how do the community

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.640
structures that are outside of
that organization participate?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.690
Well, you mentioned Direct,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.470
which is one of the technologies that I
mentioned frequently here on the course.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:36.180
What do you see as the role of Direct
in this complex mix of doctors,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.830
patients and
quality metrics that you've laid out?

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.120
&gt;&gt; Wellcentive is unique in that
we're both in analytics and

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.020
population health management,
clinical quality, system but

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.470
we're also meaningful you certified.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.210
We do that for a couple of reasons.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:57.240
One, because there's always a point
of aspect to clinical quality.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.360
But, two, we have to play nicely
with all of the standards

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.510
that are out there with all
the core point of care EHR.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.670
So that means, supporting direct and
supporting standards like CCDA.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.630
The problem with the industry right now

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.010
is that Direct is a very
flexible technology once set up.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.600
There's quite a bit of setup,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.320
quite a bit of administration
to getting it set up.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.890
And what we're seeing is that internally
to that provider organization that we

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.870
were talking about, it's much easier
just to bring the data in directly from

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:38.900
the EMRs and not worry so much about
the protocols and the directed

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:44.370
aspect of Direct, which means a provider
can direct a chart to another provider.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.780
We see Direct as really
being more the protocol for

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.140
bringing data from external
to that provider organization

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.650
from the HIE, and
those structures are really just getting

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.850
adopted by the communities and
by the provider organizations today.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.310
&gt;&gt; Well, one final question and
then I'll let you go.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.620
Put on your crystal ball glasses,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.440
and tell us where you think we're going
in the area of population health,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.350
quality measurement, and
even outcome based incentives.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.750
This is a fascinating space.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.740
I'm very honored to be part of solving
these problems in the industry.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.380
The most fundamental problem in the
industry today is again saying how do we

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.760
pay based on quality versus
paying based on a fee for

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.150
service action, a single action?

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.820
And because the patients a consumer and

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.970
they can go to many different places,
you end up having data

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.620
that contributes to the quality
spread across multiple systems.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.590
So you then have to bring that
data together to really assess

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.120
the total quality.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.730
In this comes a lot of deep
questions about who is responsible

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.250
for each of the quality actions,
but also,

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.890
which record do I look at across these
different EHRs or in the population

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:07.190
of health management system to determine
that quality action was taken.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.590
The FTC has created clinical
integration network

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:15.620
guidelines that essentially say
that a provider organization cannot

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.590
contract with payers unless
they are clinically integrated.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.310
And what that means is that they,
the organization has to behave as one

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.230
unit from a clinical
quality perspective.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.400
They have to be following the same
standards, processes and procedures.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.480
That's easier said than done.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.880
And so workflows and health systems need
to modify their internal structures and

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.450
their internal investments over time to
be able to even allow this work flow and

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:48.240
the physician work flow to understand
the entire spectrum of a longitudinal

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.440
patient record.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.170
So what's happening there
is that's getting refined.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.170
Once we achieve physician
engagement in that process, and

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.760
we have high data quality.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.060
I then expect patient engagement and

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.360
the empowerment of the consumer
in healthcare to really flourish.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.030
I think it's going to
stagnate until then.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:12.930
But after that I really see
patient engagement taking off and

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:18.050
putting the power of the care but also
the incentives into the patient's hand.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah I couldn't agree more.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.610
I think the whole role of the patient
in patient engagement just keeps

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.730
becoming more and
more prominent as time goes on.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.500
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.610
&gt;&gt; Well I want to thank you again.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.960
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; You've not only

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.740
given us an interesting technology story
which weaves in many of the themes of

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.790
the course.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.540
But a great entrepreneurial story.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.290
Two guys having a drink and

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.250
now we have a major company in
the population health space.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.800
So thank you very much.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.970
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
Thank you very much.
