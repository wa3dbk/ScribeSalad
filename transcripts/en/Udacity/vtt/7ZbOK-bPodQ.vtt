00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.416
All we need to do here is starting with this equation for the general volume of

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:09.112
a box, substitute in each of these expressions for the height, length and width.

00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:13.492
So we end up with v of x equals the quantity 7 minus 2x, times the quantity 5

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:18.120
minus 2x times x. Now of course you could multiply this out as well. And if you

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.994
go through the whole task of multiplying everything out, we end up with 4x cubed

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:29.347
minus 24x squared plus 35x. Either way though, is a totally fine form. In fact,

00:00:29.347 --> 00:00:31.890
I almost prefer this factored version.
