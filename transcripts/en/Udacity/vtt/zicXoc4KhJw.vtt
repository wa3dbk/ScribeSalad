00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.653
50.

00:00:01.653 --> 00:00:04.126
That's how many apps were available 
in Android Market

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:06.510
as Google Play was known 
when it first launched

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.460
alongside the first 
Android device in 2008.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.990
A few days later, Android Market opened
for all app developers to register

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.900
and start publishing their apps 
without any review

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.700
or validation requirements 
from Google, OEMs, or carriers.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.765
For us as developers, 
the ability to distribute apps

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.170
and the possibility of monetizing them 
through up front payments,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.200
in app billing, and advertising,
directly to the owners

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.230
over a billion android devices,
is one of the most exciting opportunities

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.850
made possible by the Android ecosystem. 
Growing up in the dark days

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.260
before smartphones and the Internet,
If I wanted a new game or app,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.760
I had to go to a physical store 
and pay for a cardboard box

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.140
filled with floppy disks or CDROMs. 
As developers, a big part

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.380
of our business plan back then
was how to get those boxes

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.660
of our software onto those shelves.
Or in the world of mobile,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.220
how to secure a carrier or OEM deal 
to get our apps preloaded

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.290
onto devices. 
Today I can install

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.992
over a million apps or games 
created by tens,

00:01:07.992 --> 00:01:11.840
if not hundreds of thousands 
of developers via Google Play,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.190
all with a click of a button. 
That's translated

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.840
into tens of billions of app installs,
an incredible opportunity

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.000
to distribute apps to Android users 
in hundreds of countries.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.410
Now in the early days of Android, 
being fast and launching first

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.010
was a pretty solid strategy for success,
but as those first 50 apps

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.550
quickly grew to hundreds, thousands, 
and now over a million apps,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.110
it takes a lot more than speed 
to stand out from the crowd.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.020
These days, the tables stakes 
are a base line of quality,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.990
and willingness to create 
great experiences for all your users.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.760
Of course, app quality can
be somewhat subjective,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.750
but over the years we've identified
the core criteria that users

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.730
identify with apps of high quality.
And to make your life easier,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.230
they're all available 
on the Android developer site

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.160
for you to review. 
This is the same checklist

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.500
that the merchandising team 
for Google Play used to ensure only apps

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.810
of quality are featured 
in their promotions

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.010
and editor's choice categories. 
And they include everything,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.023
from following 
the app design guidelines

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:16.026
to supporting 
different screen orientations,

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:19.350
tablet's, and other devices.
And, of course, ensuring that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.360
your app is stable and performant. 
So, with over a million apps

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.360
already available in Google Play 
it's no longer just a numbers game.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.010
We don't need just more apps or games, 
or even more developers.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.920
What we want is high quality apps 
from great developers, like you.
