00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.050
All right, so
that's hierarchical Lucas-Kanade.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.070
And as we described it,
it gives you a dense flow feel,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.120
it gives you a u,v in every location.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.990
But remember we said that we might
only want to do Lucas-Kanade

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.340
at areas where the eigenvalues
were well behaved,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.350
that is the places that
were kind of corner like.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.454
So, there's a version of Lucas-Kanade
called Sparse Lucas-Kanade

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:25.690
which is just that.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.700
It's a hierarchical version of,
that's applied only to what they call

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.310
good locations or
good features to track.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.390
This actually comes out of some
work by Shi and Tomassian,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.320
good features to track and
applying Lucas–Kanade to it.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.390
And by the way,
those of you who use openCV,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.100
the Lucas–Kanade used to be dense and
then they just changed it.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.440
It's now actually sparse so

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.470
now it only gives it to you
at a select set of points.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.170
And they sort of changed it without
telling you because the function still

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.910
compiles, it just,
your code just breaks a little.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.500
So so you should only be using the,
the sparse version.
