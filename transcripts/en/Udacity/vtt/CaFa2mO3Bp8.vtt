00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.340
We want to caution, however, that although genetic factors play an important

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.604
role in the development of schizophrenia, just having a genetic predisposition

00:00:06.604 --> 00:00:12.558
does not mean that somebody is going to develop the disorder. However, research

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:16.328
studies have shown that children who are exposed to abuse and neglect early in

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:21.613
life, are more likely to develop schizophrenia later in life. And that brings

00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:24.622
us to a discussion that we had in lesson three on epigenetics, that is, a

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:28.039
person can have a genetic predisposition and go throughout their lives without

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.673
developing the disorder. Or they can have that genetic predisposition, be

00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:39.008
exposed to an environmental event, and then develop the disorder. Now we've

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.592
talked before that drugs can serve as epigenetic agents, and we see here that

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:46.344
abuse and neglect can also serve as epigenetic agents which are responsible for

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:49.560
the onset of schizophrenia.
