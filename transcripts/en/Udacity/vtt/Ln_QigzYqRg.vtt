00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.950
So this instruction simply gets marked done.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.150
We then broadcast the value of three under the name of ROB6,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.300
but nobody's waiting for it. That's all that happens for writing this value.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.610
In cycle 14 we will also commit this instruction. The question for

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.550
you, which entry in the architectural register file changes, if any. Leave this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.350
blank if none of them change, otherwise write the R1, R2, et cetera, depending

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.880
on which one changes. And if it does change, that entry becomes what value?
