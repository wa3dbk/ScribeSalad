00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.060
To move the function to the right by one unit. We need to replace the x. In the

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.104
original function with x minus 1. So at that point, with just the translation

00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:14.548
to the right. We have y equals the quantity x minus 1 to the 4th. Now to move

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:19.689
down by one unit. We need to subtract 1. So this is our final equation. For

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.063
this graph over here. Y equals x minus 1 to the 4th minus 1.
