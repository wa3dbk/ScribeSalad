00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.469
Well, let's compare our answers. Here, we're checking whether the statement

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:10.228
equals the string No comment note the use of equals. When you compare two

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:15.390
strings, you should use equals. Here, we checked where the mayor said nothing

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.770
at all. Nothing at all is the empty string, the string that has no contents.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.375
And again, we use equals. Alternatively, you could use this test here, where we

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:29.960
check whether the length of the statement is 0. That's the same thing as

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.685
checking whether it equals the empty string. The third test is different. Here,

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:38.867
we don't invoke a method. We're checking whether the statement is the null

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:42.730
reference. Whether nothing has ever been assigned to the statement.
