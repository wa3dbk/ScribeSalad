00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
So remember the 2 by 2 matrix that we drew a while ago.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.210
We'll now have a closer look at this matrix as promised.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.290
So what we just found out by the way is that this part here

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.280
anything you can do on a non-deterministic RAM in polynomial time

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.060
can also be one on a deterministic RAM in exponential time.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.240
So any problem that is in this part down here would also be in this part up here.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.310
But since we are mainly interested in polynomial time,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.100
let's focus on the bottom part of this matrix for now.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.420
You'll come back to the full matrix in later units when we talked about

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.850
exponential time complexity classes and remember that each of these squares

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.260
contains all of the problems that can be solved in polynomial time.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.350
The left one on a deterministic RAM, and the right one on a non-deterministic RAM,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.080
and now, we'll give these names.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.990
So we'll call this complexity class here P, because those are all problems

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.340
that are solvable in polynomial time on a deterministic RAM.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.260
And we'll call this here NP, because those are all problems solvable in polynomial time

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.340
on a non-deterministic RAM.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.860
Of course, it wouldn't have been more consistent to call this one down here DP or something like that,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920
but this is the way we named it.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.920
And now, what we also know is that any problem that can be solved in polynomial time

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.330
on a deterministic RAM can also be solved in polynomial time on a non-deterministic RAM.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.160
We should probably rather redraw these black lines here like this because any problem

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.270
that is contained in P is automatically also contained in NP but of course not vice versa.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.190
Otherwise, we would know that there is a polynomial time algorithm

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.370
for vertex cover and the two other problems.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.640
So P contains all the problems that we know are easy.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.270
So, for example, finding the shortest path between two points in the graph

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.310
or looking up an entry in the database multiplying two numbers and thousands of problems more.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.200
So basically, any algorithm you'll have come across in an introductory algorithm scores

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.310
will fall into this category.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.180
And again, there are some theoretical nitty-gritty regarding optimization and decision problems here,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.740
but we can ignore that for the time being.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.950
So let's do a little quiz to summarize what you know by now.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.200
So given all you have learned, what can you say about P and NP?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.960
So I would like you to check which of these statements are true.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.340
The first statement is every problem in P is also contained in NP.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.060
The second statement is that every problem in NP is also contained in P.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.040
The third one is that P and NP are in fact equivalent.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.310
The fourth one is that it seems like NP should contain more problems than P or be larger than P,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.630
but we can't really say for sure.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.190
The fifth one is that vertex cover, independent set, and clique are contained in P.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.320
And the finally one is that those three problems are contained in NP.

00:03:00.320 --> 99:59:59.000
So please check every statement which given what we know by now you should consider to be true.
