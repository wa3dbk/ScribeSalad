00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.587
The next property of logarithms has to do with exponents, or powers. When we

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:09.867
have log base b of x to the a, we can really set that equal to a times log base

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:15.570
b of x. In other words, we just take this exponent of a and we bring it down in

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.885
front of our logarithm as a coefficient. In other words, if I had log of base

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:27.206
10 of a 100 to the 3rd power, we can rewrite this. We can bring this 3rd power

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:32.198
down in front of our logarithm, so we'll have 3 times the logarithm of base 10,

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:37.710
of 100. Now I usually put this in parentheses, so I understand that it's 3

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.018
times this quantity. And let's carry out the map on both sides of the equation

00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:46.352
to make sure that this makes sense. On the left hand side we'll have log of

00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:51.985
base 10 and then 100 to the 3rd power. Well 100 to the 3rd power is the same

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:58.508
thing as a million. That's 1 followed by 6 zeroes. On the left hand side we'll

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:04.958
have 3 times the log base ten of 100. Log base 10 of 100 is 2. We know this,

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:10.902
since 10 squared equals 100. We're looking for the exponent that we'd raise 10

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:17.316
to, in order to get this number. So, we know 3 times 2 equals 6. And now let's

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:22.080
check the left-hand side. We have log base 10 of a million. But we know a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.615
million is 1 followed by 6 zeros. So, that means we have to raise 10 to the 6th

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:33.600
power in order to get a million. So yes, 6 equals 6. This is just one example

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.022
of why this log property holds true. And finally, here's the last logarithm

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:42.470
property we'll examine. If we subtract two logarithms that have the same base,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.286
then we can just divide the two numbers. So the log with base b of x minus the

00:01:48.286 --> 00:01:57.292
log of base b of y equals the log of base b of x divided by y. For example, the

00:01:57.292 --> 00:02:02.779
log of base 3 of 81, minus the log of base 3 of 9 would equal the log of base 3

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:09.336
of 81 divided by 9. We simply just divide these 2 numbers inside of our

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:14.560
argument and take the log of it. And let's also be sure that this checks. We

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.546
know the log of base 3 of 81 equals 4 since 3 to the 4th equals 81. We also

00:02:20.546 --> 00:02:26.612
know the log of base 3 of 9 equals 2, since 3 squared equals 9. And, finally,

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:31.404
on the right-hand side, we'll have the log of base 3 of 81 divided by 9. We

00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:39.246
know 81 divided by 9 really equals 9, so we have log of base 3 of 9. Now we can

00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:44.729
just subtract here, so we get 2 equal to 2. We know log of base 3 of 9 is

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:50.950
really just 2, as before. Now, using those log properties, I want you to try

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.578
and write this expression with 1 logarithm. In other words, you should have the

00:02:56.578 --> 00:03:01.091
log with base b of 1 number here. Now it's okay if you're not entirely sure

00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:05.479
what to do, I just want to try your best. Think back to what it means when you

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:09.784
add logs together and when you subtract logs together. Do them one at a time

00:03:09.784 --> 00:03:14.975
and I think you might get the answer. And again it's totally okay if you don't

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:18.961
get there. You can always see the solution.
