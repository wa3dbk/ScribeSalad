00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.100
So this is actually a pretty tricky question. We've talked

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.350
a lot about vocabulary, but applying your knowledge can be

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.970
a little bit more difficult. But, let's start from the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.760
bottom and work our way up. So we know that

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.158
negative 100,000 x is a term. That means that negative

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:19.770
100,000 itself is not a term on its own. So

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.820
that means that it's not a variable term or a

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.296
constant term, since it's part of a term. You'll learn more

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:28.230
about parts of terms in the next lesson.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.700
We also know that since this is a number

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.014
and its value is not going to vary, negative

00:00:33.014 --> 00:00:37.130
100,000 is not a variable. And in the same

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.200
way, since its value is fixed, it's a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.380
constant. It's just a number. And since it's a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.090
number that's multiplied by a variable over here, it's

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.480
a coefficient. So, negative 100,000 in this context is

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.220
a constant and a coefficient. Cool. Great job working

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.230
on all of this vocab in your first lesson.
