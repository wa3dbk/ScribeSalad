00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
Now you can learn about the basics of analyzing algorithms, and we introduced three simplifications

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.330
that make our life going forward much easier.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.310
The first one was the RAM model so that we can analyze algorithms

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.260
without actually having to implement them.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.400
The second one was the concept of worst-case running time

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.450
so only having to consider the worst possible inputs and not the best ones, not the average ones,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.510
such as really the bad ones, and finally, we introduced big O notation or Landau notation

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.480
to be able to ignore all unnecessary details in the algorithm analysis.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.490
Let's go back to the example from before when we tried to count the number of times

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.370
that the sequence a b appears in the string of length n using this algorithm down here.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.490
And as you remember from the quiz, this was actually quite painful

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.410
because we had to figure out what is the wort-case input,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.400
and we noticed that this is actually not easy to figure out and even if you have this figured out.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.810
There is a lot of detailed counting that you need to do, and there are details you need to take care of

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.520
such as how often is this line here actually executed and so on.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.420
So now that we have big O notation available, our task is much easier

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.490
because we can just make two observations and will be able to state the running time.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.360
So the first observation you can make is that the algorithm will actually go through the string

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.790
one by one by one, and since it always just looks at a single character and the next character,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.550
the algorithm will look at each character and again put string at most twice.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.450
And the second thing to notice is that each time the algorithm does consider a character

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.530
so it starts out to zero, one, two, three and so on, it will perform a constant number of operations.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.300
So if it finds an a, it will do either one or two additional operations,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.360
and if it does not find an a, it will do zero additional operations.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.430
So for each character in the input string, a constant number of steps is performed

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.510
and this is exactly advantage here because with big O notation, we can ignore constant.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.460
So overall, this means that if you have an input of length n, the algorithm will perform

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.660
a number of steps that some constant times n plus some constant for all the rest of the operations,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.410
but using big O notation, we already know that this is O of n.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.400
So we do not need to care anymore about the detailed number of times this here is executed.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.550
We do not need to care about the detail such as how often this line here is executed.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.380
We can just say that the running time of this algorithm is O of n,

00:02:37.380 --> 99:59:59.000
which would also be referred to as a liner algorithm.
