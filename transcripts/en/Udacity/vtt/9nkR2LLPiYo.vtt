00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.896
Welcome to CS101. I'm Dave Evans, I will be your guide on this journey.

00:00:03.896 --> 00:00:06.745
This course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing

00:00:06.745 --> 00:00:09.579
and teach you to read and write your own computer programs.

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.763
We are going to do that in the context of building a web search engine.

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:16.361
I'm guessing everyone here has at least used a search engine before.

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:20.714
Like Google, DuckDuckGo or even my personal favorite - DaveDaveFind.

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:23.631
You type in what you are looking for, and voila -

00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:28.379
in literally a blink of an eye, about a tenth of a second, back come the results.

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:32.695
This might not be enough to make you wise, but it is pretty amazing.

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:36.196
A goal of this class is to turn some of the magic of the search engine

00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:38.196
into something a bit more understandable.

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:41.196
Our biggest goal tho is to learn about computer science.

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:43.345
Computer science is about how to solve problems,

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:44.997
like building a search engine,

00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:46.896
by breaking them into smaller pieces

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:51.945
and then precisely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that you can use to solve each piece.

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:54.863
And those steps can be executed by a computer.

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:57.162
For our search engine the three main pieces are:

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:59.229
finding data by crawling web pages,

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.445
building an index to be able to respond quickly to search queries,

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:06.512
and ranking pages so that we get the best result for a given query.

00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:08.562
In this course we will not get into everything that you need

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:10.762
to build a search engine as powerful as Google,

00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:14.996
but we will cover the main ideas and learn a lot about computer science along the way.

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:17.779
The first three units will focus on building the web crawler.

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:19.529
We will talk more about that soon.

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:22.846
Units 4 and 5 will cover how to respond to queries quickly.

00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:25.213
And unit 6 will get into how to rank results

00:01:25.213 --> 00:01:29.046
and cover the method Google uses to rank pages, that made it so successful.

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:31.492
But first, let's talk about how to build a web crawler

00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:35.000
that we are going to use to get data for our search engine.
