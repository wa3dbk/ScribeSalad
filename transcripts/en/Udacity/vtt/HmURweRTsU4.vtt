00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.620
So we begin executing this instruction. It's a subtraction of 36 minus 3.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.230
That's, our result is going to be 33. And it takes only 1 cycle to do adds and

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.450
subtracts. So this result will be broadcast in cycle 26.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.620
So now, the next thing that will happen is either this or

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.470
this will broadcast. Cycle 26 is the next cycle. So let's see what happens then.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.800
In cycle 26, the subtract broadcast a value of 33. Under the name of ROB5.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.380
So we mark it as done. 33 gets put here and

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.450
33 under the name ROB5 gets broadcast. And this instruction here is waiting for.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.720
That value. So we get 33 here, are no longer waiting for

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.880
it. Oh, yes, and because this instruction has been dispatched during cycle 24.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.030
In cycle 25 and after was this reservation station has really been free.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.670
So this instruction, although it got now 33, still is not ready to dispatch,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.710
because it's still waiting for ROB1, so it cannot go. Okay? So

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.840
in cycle 27,. Nothing happens. 28, nothing happens. In fact,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.830
the first time when something does happen from now is going to be cycle 42 when

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.010
the result of ROB1 is brokers. So ledger's going to fast forward there. So

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.620
let's say we are now in cycle 42, this divide finally brokers the value of nine,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.400
under the name ROB1. What happens is. When that happens, is we put the 9 here,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.840
we mark it as done and the 9 with ROB1 tag is broadcast on the Bus.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.620
And all the instructions that are waiting for that is going to,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.650
are going to capture that value. The only that really needs anything is this and

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.130
it captures the value of 9 and is no longer waiting for anything. So

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.070
in cycle 43, finally this ROB6 instruction, is going to begin execution.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.742
So with that let's move to Cycle 43.

00:01:55.742 --> 00:02:00.614
In cycle 43, we begin execution of this instruction. It's an add 33 and 9 so

00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:05.930
we end up with a 42 value here. This reservation station is now free.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.850
This is an add, so it's going to finish in cycle 44. There is another thing that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.470
happens in cycle 43, which is, all this time, we have been waiting to commit

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.320
this instruction, because none of the other ones can commit until it commits.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.910
Finally, we have been in cycle 42 to write the results, so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.530
in cycle 43 we can actually commit this instruction, it's been marked as done.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.870
So pretty much the commit logic is kind of staring at this entry and waiting to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.780
see a cycle where, this entry has a check mark next to it. So what happens is

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.100
finally we commit this in cycle 43. Now that this instruction commits in 43,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.460
what's going to happen is several things. First, the ROB entry for

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.080
this instruction will be freed, but before we free the ROB entry, we need to

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.490
update the register files, so what's going to happen is we take this 9,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.640
and we're going to write it to register R2. So register R2 is now going to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.510
be written as 9. Next, we're going to look at the RAT entry for R2,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.860
and see whether it's pointing to our ROB entry. Yes it is. So

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.710
from now on, ROB1 will be free after this cycle. What we have to do,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.010
is make this R2 entry point back to the register file. You know,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.780
so the value of 9, that since recently has been, basically pointing to,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.050
you know, like. R2 is here. Now, it's no longer going to be here,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.190
so we need to make it point to R2 is here. I just kind of, deleted this, but

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.720
this really means you can find it in the register file.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.640
So now really, we are ready to delete this stuff here.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.920
And now finally. The divide has fully committed. Okay? So now,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.160
if we had an exception or something, basically the divide looks like it's done.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.930
All of the other instructions really are done, except for the last one.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.840
But they're not considered done as far as the program order is concerned.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.780
Basically the commit didn't get there yet. So now let's move the cycle 44 and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.540
see what happens.
