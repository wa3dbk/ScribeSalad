00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The correct answer is it will stay as it is.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
One way of seeing this is the following--the central compartment loses

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
temperature to the left and gains temperature from the right if you will.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The amount of gain and loses proportional to the difference in temperature,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but to the left and to the right, the difference in temperature is the same,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so we lose as much as we gain.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The temperature of the central compartment has to stay constant.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Of course, the same is true for the compartment to the left.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We'll just look at one further compartment down the road

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and see that this compartment to the left gains as much as its going to lose.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Another way of seeing this behavior is to look at the heat equation.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The partial derivative of the temperature with respect to time

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
equals thermal diffusivity times the second derivative of temperature.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, with respect to x, this is a line of constant slope, which means we have to form the derivative

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of this derivative with respect to x, but when the first derivative is constant,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
the derivative of this derivative is zero--this line has a slope of zero, so the right hand side

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
of the heat equation equals zero, which leads us to the statement that there is no change in time.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In reality, of course, we can never have this type of linear gradient going on and on.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The temperature must not shrink below 0 K, but of course in practice, there's some upper limit as well.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So eventually, we will see some changes to that curve

00:01:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because energy accumulates downstairs and is depleted upstairs.
