00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.490
Here is two more examples of class rectangles describing

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.110
classes in a in a system.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.840
On the left is the rectangle class.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.860
It has two instance variables describing points.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.876
These might be, for example, the upper left-hand corner or

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:22.274
lower right-hand corner.

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:27.358
The particular instance variables attributes have names p1 and p2.

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:32.019
And they have types point which presumably you've also declared in

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.170
your UML model.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.990
In the operation section, there are three groups of operations,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.790
each group is separated by a stereotype.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.290
You can see the stereotypes because they

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.630
appear within the double angle brackets.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.240
For example, at the top, there's a stereotype for

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.340
constructor, in the middle there's one for

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.820
query operations, and at the bottom there's one for update operations.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.069
Within the, those three groups,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.910
there's obviously going to be a constructor operation.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.550
There's query operations for giving the area, and the aspect ratio

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.760
of the rectangle, and they're going to return real numbers.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.360
Real is a primitive type within UML.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.410
And at the bottom we have update operations for moving and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.400
scaling the rectangle.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.960
On the right is the reservation class.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.290
You notice things are a little different here.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.330
We don't have any attributes.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.480
We begin initially with operations, and

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.820
then we have two additional horizontal units.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.180
One for responsibilities and one for exceptions.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.430
Note specifically that the words operations, responsibilities and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.370
exceptions here are not part of UML.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.540
They're just here to show you what the boxes are being used for.
