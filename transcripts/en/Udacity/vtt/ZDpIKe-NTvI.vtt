00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.120
This was another trick question because looking at this code alone,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.650
it would be hard to answer the question of how our callback will get

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.350
called since we can't see the function indication here.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.010
In order to answer this question, we actually need to look at

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.660
either the source code or the documentation for setTimeout.
