00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.740
Comparison among labels,
just look at a quick example.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.720
L1 is TS and itss compartment has
these three categories, A, B and C.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.119
L2 is secret with A, B and L3 is secret
also with B, C, D as their categories.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.431
So does L1 dominate L2?

00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:22.420
TS is dominate S and
A, B, C contains A, B.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.690
So, we said that each,
for L1 to dominate L2,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.750
the sensitivity level has to be greater,
which is the case,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.120
and its compartment has to contain the
compartment of L2, which is the case.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.820
So this is, yes.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.700
Does L2 is less than L1?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.970
Yes, the same reasoning we did.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.690
It's less because this is less than
TS and this is containing that.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.220
How about L1 and L3?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.300
As we know, TS is higher than S.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.970
So when you look at the first part,
just the sensitivity level,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.690
that's the total orders, so
this is greater than this.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.045
But B, C, D is not contained in A,
B, C, okay?

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:03.342
So there's this element D
that's not contained here and

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:07.264
because this is not contained here
then L1 is not greater than L3.

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:11.232
Similarly, L3 is not greater than L1,
and the two are not equal because

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:15.172
the compartments are different and
the sensitude level is different.

00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:18.430
So, when neither one dominates
the other one and they are not equal,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.060
then they can not be compared, which is
the third case that we're talking about.
