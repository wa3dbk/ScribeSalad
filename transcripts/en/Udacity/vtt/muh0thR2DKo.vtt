00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.000
What I want to stress is that,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.480
like a painter goes through many iterations of his or her final masterpiece,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.260
going back to re-sketch, re-draw, change canvases, layer paint, etc.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.350
The data visualization process is not simply just the frosting on a data

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.210
analysis cake after it's been baked, but a fundamental and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.990
integral part of the process as a whole.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.600
And while you may read this graphic from left to right,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.470
each stage is often iterative and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.570
you will find yourself traversing this process in a somewhat nonlinear fashion.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.800
One step, may better inform what you have done in a previous step.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.340
For example, maybe only once you visualize your data that you realize that there

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.850
are way too many points to make sense of and you need to go back and filter and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.870
mine your data.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.590
To transform it into a new form that might be much more easy to

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.000
understand from a visual perspective.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.420
Also, you can imagine some insight that you might discover in an earlier stage,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.860
that you might want to incorporate in your final visualization.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.700
Or some new data that you find online that you think will add more context, and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.190
bolster the narrative you've created.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.900
And while data visualization in and of itself is a very expansive discipline,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.310
ranging from interactive art installations that data artists produce,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.430
to business analytical dashboards and charts.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.980
One of the running themes throughout this course will be,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.770
how to best leverage the principles that we learned about visualization theory

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.540
combined with technologies like D3 to communicate our data and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.580
insights in the most effective manner.
