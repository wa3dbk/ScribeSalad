When evaluating expressions, it's important that we use parentheses. I didn't

00:00:03.582 --> 00:00:06.480
use parentheses on that last quiz, because I only had two variables, and one

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.394
operation between them. But we should always use parentheses when replacing

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:14.782
variables. Here's why. Here's an expression of triangles and circles. One thing

00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:17.918
that we want to be careful about, is what's the operation between symbols and

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:22.551
numbers? Well, we assume that there's multiplication between variables, or

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:26.008
symbols, and numbers. We don't often show it in algebra, but we want to make

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.436
sure that we always include that there. We'll see other examples of this later

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:32.607
throughout the course. I'm going to assign a value of the triangles to be

00:00:32.607 --> 00:00:36.312
negative 1. And I'm going to assign the values of the circles to be 3. We

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:40.920
want to use parenthesis when we replace variables because of negative sign.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.014
Here's what it would look like. I would have 3 times negative 1, because the

00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:48.408
triangle is negative 1. Then times 3, because a circle is 3 plus 4 times

00:00:48.408 --> 00:00:53.890
negative 1 again for the triangle. And it's squared. And then times 3, for the

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.259
circle. And on the end, I would have minus negative 1. To the third. Here, this

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.938
circle is really an exponent. So I have 3 times negative 1 times 3, which is

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:08.621
negative 9. I know negative 1 squared is negative 1 times negative 1. Negative

00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:15.216
1 times negative 1 is just positive 1. So I have negative 9, then plus, and

00:01:15.216 --> 00:01:19.735
then I have 4 times 1 times 3, which is 12. Now, on this end part here, I have

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:23.952
to do negative 1 cubed first. I know powers come first. I've rewritten the

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:27.315
statement over here, so now negative 1 cubed is really negative 1 times

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:31.927
negative 1 times negative 1. I know three negative 1s make up negative 1, the

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:36.476
first two would be positive 1, then I'd make it negative. So I have negative 9

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:41.840
plus 12, subtracting a negative is really adding a positive. Negative nine plus

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.762
12 is three, plus one, is four. When I plug in the value of negative one for my

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:48.476
triangles, and when I plug in the value of three for the circles, I get an

00:01:48.476 --> 00:01:50.450
answer of four.
