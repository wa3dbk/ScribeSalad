Let's use scientific notation one last time. Here was the number of cells that

00:00:04.742 --> 00:00:06.006
we had, 16,777,216.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:10.506
16,000,000 was the number of cells we decided upon. We knew the 1 and 6 were

00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:15.211
most important. So, let's take this number and write it in scientific notation.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.128
