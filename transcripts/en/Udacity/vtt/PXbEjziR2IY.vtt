00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.990
Let's wrap up this lesson.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.190
We've talked about three key ways
to compute the value of a company.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.010
Intrinsic value,
which is based on future dividends.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.870
In other words, companies pay a certain
amount to their investors every year,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.130
based on how many shares they own.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.200
And this is the value of all future
dividends going into the future.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.620
Book value, which is the value of the
company if we split it up into pieces

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.210
and sold those individual pieces.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.890
And finally market
capitalization which is

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.840
simply the value that the market
is placing on the company.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.630
So, many stock trading strategies
look for deviations between say,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.040
intrinsic value and market cap if
intrinsic value drops significantly and

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.840
the stock price say is high, it may
be worthwhile to short that stock.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.620
Or if say dividends are going up and
the market capitalization is low it

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.589
might be an opportunity
to buy the stock.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.570
And similarly book value
provides a sort of lowest

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.740
price, when stock price begins
to approach book value, you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.860
can pretty much assume that the price
is not going to go below book value.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.220
Or not much below it,
because if it does,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.490
a predatory buyer would buy the whole
company, and break it up for parts.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.210
Anyhow, that's company valuation.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.435
And I look forward to seeing
you at the next lesson.

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:34.764
Bye bye.
