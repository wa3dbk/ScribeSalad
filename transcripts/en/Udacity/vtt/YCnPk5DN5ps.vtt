00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.280
Coping files in Gradle is simple.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.480
We start by simply declaring a new task,
and

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.540
specifying the type of the task as Copy.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.770
Of course this task won't
actually do anything,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.565
because we haven't told it what file
we'd like copied, and to where.

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:17.045
Simplest example is to copy
the contents of one folder to another.

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:19.965
We use the copy tasks from
method to add sources, and

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.475
the into method to
specify the destination.

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.875
This copy task will copy
the contents of the images directory

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.430
into the build directory.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.930
We can specify files to include or
exclude, our filters can use wild cards,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.080
allowing us to do things like, include
all files that match a certain pattern,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.440
or have a particular file extension.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.790
This combination of source,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.450
destination, inclusions and
exclusions is called a copy spec.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.180
Let's configure our task to
only include jpeg images,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.010
by calling the include method,
and passing a file pattern.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.280
We can also configure a single copy
task to copy from multiple sources.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.930
Copy specs can be hierarchical, which
is particularly useful when you want to

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.800
exclude certain files from
a particular sub-folder, or

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.630
a specific Include them in another.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.800
Let's configure a copy task which
copies all JPEGs into one folder, and

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.680
all GIFs into another.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.970
We define two child copy specs.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.320
One to include only JPEG files, and
the other to include only GIFs.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.010
We also specify the folder we
want to copy these files into.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.020
These folders will be created as
subfolders, under the root copy

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.630
destination, the result being that
JPEGs will be copied to build/jpeg, and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.530
all GIFT files will be
copied to build/gif.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.640
Gradle provides task types for
creating archives like ZIP or TAR files.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.770
Archive tasks are nearly identical to
copy tasks, except instead of specifying

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.020
a destination directory,
we specify an archive name.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.010
Let's zip up all files
in out images directory.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.870
We use the Zip task base name,
and destinationDir properties

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.950
to tell Gradle what to name the archive,
and where to create it.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.530
Note the the destinationDir
property takes a Java file object.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.370
Luckily, the Gradle project interface
provides a convenience method for

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.550
creating files.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.440
We can do similar things with
archive tasks and trial copy specs.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.780
We can create an archive
which puts JPEGs and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.070
GIFs into their own
directories inside the archive.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.500
The only difference from
our copy task example,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.449
is that we specify the archive name and
the destination.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.090
Sometimes we want to delete
files during our builds,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.200
usually to clean up
previous build outputs.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.370
We can use the delete task to delete
files or folders in our project.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.400
Here we have a task that
deletes the build folder.
