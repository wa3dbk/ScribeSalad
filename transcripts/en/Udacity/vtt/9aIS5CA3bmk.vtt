Now that the friends are in an array list. To remove a friend, I just needs to

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.953
know its index, and then I can call friends.remove, and that one will be

00:00:07.953 --> 00:00:15.823
erased, and the indexes will be fixed. In BlueJ, that would look like this. I

00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:19.215
would find the index of the nonFriend, using the find method, and then remove

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:23.930
the friend, at nonFriendIndex. But I need to be a little bit careful,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.664
nonFriendIndex could be minus one. I can't remove the person if they're not

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:32.054
there to begin with. So if the nonFriendIndex is not minus one, then I remove

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:35.100
the friend. Otherwise, I don't do anything.
