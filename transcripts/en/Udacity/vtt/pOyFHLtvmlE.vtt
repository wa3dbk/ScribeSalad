00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.317
In this session,
we're going to talk about arrays.

00:00:02.317 --> 00:00:04.763
In Swift,
arrays are known as a collection type.

00:00:04.763 --> 00:00:08.550
And like they sound, a collection type
allows us to store multiple values or

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.140
a collection of values.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.300
Specifically, arrays are ordered
collections where the multiple values,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.600
also called instances,
have the same type.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.230
Let's get started.
