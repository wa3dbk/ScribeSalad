00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.507
The correct choice is this third one. For any number n, the square root of n is

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.939
equivalent to some number that when multiplied by itself, gives us n. I know

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:13.599
that this is a lot of words, so let's just break that down. Squaring a number or

00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:18.081
taking it to the second power, we know means, multiplying it by itself. So, if

00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:23.767
we have 3 squared, that's just two threes multiplied together. But I know that

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.386
if I take the square root of 3 squared, then I can get just the 3 back. So,

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:33.620
taking a square root can undo this repeated multiplication. The square root of

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:38.682
any number then like n, for example, tells us what we need to multiply by itself

00:00:38.694 --> 00:00:39.201
to get n.
