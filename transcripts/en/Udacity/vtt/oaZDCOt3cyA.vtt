00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.064
So if we're just concerned a part of scenario two having to do with, you know,

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:05.296
the check being made and

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:09.570
we're talking about maybe the user pulling back a pot after things have started.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.755
We have the first step being the start,

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:15.080
being sent from the user interface to the hot water source.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.432
And then the user pulls off the pot and the containment vessel senses this and

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:22.152
sends a message to the hot water source saying,

00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:24.404
hold it don't pour out any more water.

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:27.204
And then later, the user puts the pot back on and

00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:31.773
the contain, the containment vessel says, okay, we can now proceed.

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:35.989
And we can indicate that in a collaboration diagram labeling the steps one, two,

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:36.990
three in this case.
