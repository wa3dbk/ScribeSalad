00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.690
Paid social marketing is another way to
get your product in front of valuable

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.680
customers.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.830
Now you're probably already using social
media to engage with the community for

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.380
free, but when you want to drive
customer acquisition directly,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.930
you can consider buying paid
marketing on social media.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.580
LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
Snapchat, StumbleUpon, Pinterest

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.148
are all among some of the biggest names
in paid social marketing right now.

00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:27.250
Now there are few things you
should think about when paying for

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.970
social media marketing.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.600
First, you need to understand
how the different ads are sold

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.920
because each network
does it differently.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.460
For example, LinkedIn and Facebook
will have you pay by impression.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.840
On the other hand, Twitter is going to
have you pay based on engagements.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.600
Second, optimize the design
of your ad for smartphones.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.480
Social media is overwhelmingly
consumed on mobile devices.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.200
Over half of Facebook users visit
the site on a mobile device, and

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.750
Twitter users spend 80% of their
time on the mobile devices.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.670
So you want to keep that in
mind with your messaging.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.320
Your ad should be short and
to the point.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.820
Your ads should also link directly
to the mobile landing page or

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.160
directly to the app you
want them to download.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.700
And the settings should be aligned
to different mobile platforms you’re

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.440
aiming for.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.000
And third, have some fun with it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.057
Explore with the different
platforms they let you do.

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:14.763
For example,
Twitter will let you pay for

00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:16.337
tweets that are targeted by ZIP code.

00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:20.700
On the other hand, Snapchat let's
you sponsor selfies like this one.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.338
So let's hear from the social
media marketing expert.

00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:26.180
&gt;&gt; My name is Chris Morell and
I worked in social media marketing and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.730
content marketing for
the last ten years or so for

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.520
brands including Fitbit, Clif Bar, Sony
PlayStation, and now here at Udacity.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.490
When you're thinking about
starting with social media,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.640
there's some really important
things to consider.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.170
I think first and foremost,
know your audience.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.820
I can't stress that enough.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.060
Go and do research on your
audiences on each social platform.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.130
Dig into analytics.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.490
Dig into Twitter analytics,
Facebook analytics,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.790
anything you can to get a really
good sense of your audience.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.525
Make sure you're constantly listening
to what your audience is saying.

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:57.925
This will give you a really great
perception of your audience and

00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:00.925
exactly who you're trying to
market to with paid social.

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:04.075
The target audiences for
each social channel are going to vary.

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:06.775
And I think the more that your app or
product develops and

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:10.180
the more time you spend in each channel,
you're going to realize that each

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.950
audience has its different,
unique characteristics.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.230
For example, Twitter might be really
great for customer support and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.560
Instagram and Pinterest might be great
for sharing organic photo assets,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.600
brand images and just really great,
engaging content.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.410
It's important to really
know your demographics.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.370
Do some research, use free tools, use
anything at your disposal to discover

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.970
age, gender and any important
demographic info that you think is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.990
going to help create a better and
more successful ad campaign.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.930
When you start setting up campaigns
you're also going to notice that the big

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.850
platforms Facebook, Twitter and
LinkedIn, they're really competitive.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.490
Something to consider if you
want to stay ahead of the curve

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.310
is to advertise on emerging channels.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.050
So think Instagram and
Pinterest, think Snapchat.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.530
These aren't going to be as competitive
as channels like Twitter, Facebook,

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.680
LinkedIn and
you might get better returns.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.020
Success on channels like Instagram and
Pinterest might be as simple as creating

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.450
experiences and
ads that feel real to the user.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.600
They feel like organic posts from
our brand, and not an advertisement.
