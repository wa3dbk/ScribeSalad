&gt;&gt; Interesting answer, David, note that there are several factors in

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.260
David's answers. In the two situations that he thought were most similar to

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.430
a woman climbing up a ladder, in the similarity in the relationship, climbing up

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.350
as well as similarity between objects, woman and ladder. In contrast, one that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.070
he did not think was really similar to a woman climbing up a ladder, woman

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.610
painting a ladder. Although there is some similarity between the objects woman,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.910
and ladder, the relationship is very different here it is climbing up a ladder,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.590
here it is painting a ladder which are two very different activities.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.370
Between one and two we notice, that both of them have the same relationship,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.830
climbing up, but an object is different, In one case it is the step ladder and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.950
in another case it is a set of stairs. So one can have similarities in

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.410
relationships, one can have similarities in objects, of course some of you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.980
may have different rankings with the similarities of the one they would give.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.010
Because, your background knowledge might be different or your priorities might

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.350
be different, but the point here is the similarity can be measured around

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.210
several dimensions. Around the dimension of relationships, around

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.760
the dimension of objects, around the dimensions of features of objects, and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.538
around the dimensions of values of features of objects that are participating in

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:12.100
relationships, we'll talk more about this in just a few minutes.
