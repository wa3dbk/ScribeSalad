00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.840
In this lesson, we have discussed VLIW processors, and their itanium cousins.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.650
We have learned the pros and cons of these processors, and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.970
also some of the reasons for the itaniums high expectations and eventual demise.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.980
This lesson concludes the first part of my high-performance computer

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.510
architecture course, where we have learned how the modern processor core works.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.380
In the next part of the course, we will learn how to get good performance even

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.670
though the main memory is really slow, and way too small to fit the programs we

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.250
want to run. After that, the final part of the course is about putting multiple

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.220
processor cores together to get even more performance and energy efficiency.
