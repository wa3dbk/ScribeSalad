00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.782
We'd say the view of the bird is pretty distorted. Really the problem is that

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:06.789
you're not sitting close enough to the screen. It's sort of like being

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:10.690
overweight. I could instead say I'm not dense enough. If I was denser, then I'd

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.798
look thinner. Think of what the field of view represents. When you look at your

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:18.849
monitor or tablet or mobile device, you're a given distance away from it. The

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.600
screen itself is a certain height. This forms a real world field of view angle.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.615
A window on your screen is your window into a virtual world. Say this window in

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:31.680
the real world has a 20 degree field of view for your real world eye position.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.893
If your virtual world also has the same field of view, you won't perceive any

00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:38.868
distortion. Objects toward the edge of the screen might look distorted if you

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:42.666
were to back away from the screen. But at your current eye position, the field

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:46.714
of view is perfect. The image is warped a bit in projection. But your eye is

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:50.774
seeing the screen at a tilt that compensates for it. The formula for height for

00:00:50.774 --> 00:00:53.946
a given field of view and distance from the screen is height equals 2 times

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:57.222
tangent of the field of view divided by 2, don't forget to use radians, times

00:00:57.222 --> 00:01:02.240
the distance. As the field of view increases, the tangent value increases, and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.505
so the height of the monitor increases. Increases. What tends to happen in

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:09.430
video games is that the designer cranks up the virtual world's field of view so

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.561
that the players can see more of what's happening around them. This can

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.313
certainly lead to a more playable game, but this is also where the distortion

00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:19.108
comes from, from the fact that the virtual field of view doesn't match the real

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:23.927
world field of view. If you moved your point of view so that you were at the

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:27.161
apex of the virtual world's frustom right here, the virtual world would appear

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:31.176
undistorted. Of course it might actually all be blurry at this distance, or you

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:33.730
might get a massive headache, but that's the theory.
