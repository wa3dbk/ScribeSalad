00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.270
As you remember, Objective-C is pretty
blase about its handling of nil values.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.940
Like Desmir mentioned, by default any
object can be nil in Objective-C.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.250
&gt;From Swift's perspective, the danger of
nil values lurks around every corner.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.050
If your Swift code is
consuming Objective-C code,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.980
you need to be constantly checking for
nil values.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.240
Unexpected nil values that are handled
incorrectly can crash your app.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.090
To see how an unexpected null value
might get passed to your Swift code,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.290
let's take a look at how Objective-C
gets translated into Swift by default.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.847
Let's say we have an Objective-C
class that represents a user.

00:00:36.847 --> 00:00:41.544
Our user class has properties
representing a user's name, email, and

00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:43.010
avatar.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.260
And down here we have an initializer
that takes two strings as parameters but

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.660
doesn't take an avatar.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.230
Not every user has an avatar.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.420
If we click on this icon
in the top left corner,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.020
down at the bottom of the menu we see
this option for Generated interface.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.460
Clicking that option gives us the
interface that's generated for Swift.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.310
So, okay,
we've got some Swift code now and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.120
we see name, avatar, and
email along with the init method.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.330
But we also see a lot
of exclamation points.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.660
By default, Swift treats every
variable coming from Objective-C

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.370
as an implicitly unwrapped optional.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.200
As we know, implicitly unwrapped
optionals are dangerous.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.910
We don't want to be accidentally
unwrapping null values.
