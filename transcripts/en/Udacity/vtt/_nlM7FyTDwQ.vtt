We haven't talked about graphs at all, so let's think about them for a minute.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.173
How do you think graphs of logarithmeic functions of different bases relate to

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:12.980
one another? Well, here's just an example, but this line right here shows the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.840
graph of Y equals log base 10 of X. And this one shows Y equals log base 2 of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.560
X. Since we've been talking about change of base so much. How about we try to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.640
convert log base two of X to an expression with log base 10? How would you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.689
rewrite this with this change of base?
