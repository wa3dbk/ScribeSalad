00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.330
Now you know how to compute daily
portfolio values and, from there,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.750
important portfolio statistics.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.720
The main ones we're going to focus on
are cumulative return, average daily

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.570
return, standard deviation of daily
return, or risk, and Sharpe ratio.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.350
These are the key factors most people
focus on when evaluating the performance

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.930
of a portfolio.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.300
The assignment associated
with this lesson is for

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.850
you to build a function that can
calculate these values automatically.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.479
You've got what you need to build this,
so have at it.
