00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.990
Now that we've introduced these factors
and to find them, we're now able to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.890
describe the fundamental law as
expressed by Richard Grinold.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.430
And it's simple, it's just this.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.730
He was able to show mathematically
that information ratio

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.580
is equal to information coefficient
times the square root of breadth.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.140
I'm just going to present it without
proof here and encourage you to go look

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.440
at Grinold's book if you're interested,
for more detail.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.530
So, performance of the manager, or

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.270
the fund, is due to the skill
at making predictions.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.410
Times the square root of breadth.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.650
So that means, for instance, that yes,
you may be very skilled but you've got

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.930
to have opportunities to invest in
order to operationalize your skill.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.500
Now if you want to improve your
performance you can either

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.770
focus on improving your skill or
focus on improving your breadth.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.290
Sometimes it turns out,
that it's a lot easier to increase

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.860
breadth by finding additional stocks you
might look at or additional markets.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.900
You might have some commodity
trading strategy that works great.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.040
You can increase your breadth by
looking at additional commodities.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.510
However, the strength of this increase,
in other words, as you increase breadth,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.890
the overall performance only increases
as the square root of that breadth.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.170
So it tapers off after
some amount of time.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.200
It turns out, though, that it's very,
very hard to improve your skill, so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.040
that is why,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.610
for instance, folks often focus on
the breadth component of this equation.
