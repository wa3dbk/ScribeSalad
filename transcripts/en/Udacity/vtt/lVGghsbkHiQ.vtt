We can write two ratios and set up a proportion. We can set them equal to each

00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:09.143
other. I know that for 3 packs of gum, I have to pay 87 cents. For 10 packs of

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:13.305
gum, I don't know the cost. I'm going to use a variable to represent that

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:17.649
number, I'm going to use t. We have one equation and one unknown. So, let's

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:21.736
solve for this variable. We multiply both sides of the equation by the

00:00:21.748 --> 00:00:26.415
denominators. 87 hundredths times t. The 87 hundredth is reduce to 1, because

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:31.527
they are a factor in the numerator and the denominator, and the t is reduce to

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.661
1. t divided by t, makes 1. So, I'm left with 3 times t on the left, or 3t, And

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:40.583
8 and 7 tenths on the right, the result of 10 times 87 hundredths. Remember, we

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:45.709
just move the decimal one place to the right. I know t represents an amount of

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:50.117
money, so I know 8 and 7 tenths is really 8 dollars and 70 cents. I going to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.986
divide that amount by 3, so 1t is equal to $2.90, this was the cost of our ten

00:00:55.998 --> 00:01:00.645
pack of gum. If you've gotten at least one of these right, nice work. We're

00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:05.474
going to solve similar problems involving expressions and equations in the next

00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:07.512
sections. Keep up the great work.
