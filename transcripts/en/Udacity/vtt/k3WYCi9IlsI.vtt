00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.460
The first term I want to define, is failure.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.080
A failure is an observable incorrect behavior of the software.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.910
It is conceptually related to the behavior of the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.910
program, rather than its code. The second term I want

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.600
to introduce is fault, which is also called bug.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.540
And the fault or bug, is an incorrect piece of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.780
code. In other words, a fault is related to

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.900
the code. And is a necessary, but not sufficient condition

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.160
for the occurrence of a failure. The final

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.880
term I want to introduce is, error. Where an

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.630
error is the cause of a fault. It is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.990
usually a human error, which can be conceptual. A

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.620
typo or something along those lines. And know that

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.422
this terminology, failure, fault and error, is the official

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:46.945
[UNKNOWN] terminology. So you cannot go wrong if you

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:51.282
use it. Now, let me illustrate the difference between

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:57.153
failure, fault and error. Using a small example. What I'm showing here is

00:00:57.153 --> 00:01:00.876
a small function that, as you can see from its name, takes an

00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:04.920
integer parameter i. And is supposed to double the value of i, and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.420
return it. As we can clearly see, this is not what the function does.
