00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.470
If we have a Monte Carlo algorithm that produces the best possible solution with probability 1/2

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.039
and we run it a couple of times, then what happens.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:14.320
If we run it the first time, we can be 50% sure that we already have the best possible answer.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.080
Then we run it again so the probability in  the second run is again 1/2

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.640
that we do not get the best possible answer and in the third run, it's again 1/2 and so on.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.990
Now this is the probability of getting a suboptimal solution and of course, if we want to be

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.810
99.9% sure that we get the best possible solution, the probability of getting a suboptimal solution

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:47.070
should be smaller than 0.1% and then the problem becomes (1/2)^n and n is the number of times

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.780
that we run this algorithm here should be smaller than 0.001, which is the same as 0.1%

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.500
and then you can just solve for n and get the answer and we have to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.250
run this algorithm just 10 times which is pretty neat.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.810
Now of course for an NP complete problem, it's very unlikely that we get a probability like this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.740
because as you can see we could very, very, very quickly in polynomial time

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.680
get a solution that is almost guarantee to be optimal.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.270
So what you will find for most Monte Carlo algorithms for challenging problems

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.740
is that the probability here first of all becomes sometimes even exponentially small

00:01:27.740 --> 99:59:59.000
and second that it also depends on the input size but we'll soon see how that works out concretely.
