00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.210
To conclude this lesson, I want to discuss the

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.170
concept of negative design patterns, that is, patterns that should

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.600
be avoided. Interestingly, negative patterns were also mentioned in

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.950
Christopher Alexander's book, so in the first formulation of patterns.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.219
So negative design pattern are basically guidelines on how

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.689
not to do things. In consoles with patterns, the guidelines

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.920
on how to do things. So basically, what the negative

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.170
design patterns do is, they enable recurring design defects to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.070
be avoided. And as we will see in this class extensively,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.080
in mini-course four, negative patterns are

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.380
also called anti-patterns or bad smells,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.540
or bad code smells. So in mini-course four we will see several

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.480
examples of bad smells and what we can do to eliminate them.
