00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.791
This is just another case we need to
substitute in new values for these two

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:08.117
quantities, money from all original orders
and money from canceled orders into this

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.416
expression using these other two
equations. As we learned about

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:15.593
substitution very early on in the course,
if we have a system of equations that we

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:19.745
know is allowed to work together and one
quantity in one of the equations is equal

00:00:19.757 --> 00:00:24.365
to another quantity in another one of the
equations. We can replace that quantity

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:29.040
with the other way to express it. So in
the case of these equations that means we

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:33.655
can replace money from all our original
orders right here with this expression,

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:36.915
87w+72n.
Since this equation tells us that, that is

00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:41.632
equal to the money from all the original
orders. We can do the same thing with the

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:45.516
money from the canceled orders or the
amount of money that Grant would have

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:49.318
gotten if these orders hadn't been
canceled. So we'll replace money from

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.081
canceled orders with 3w+12n.
So this is what the equation looks like if

00:00:53.093 --> 00:00:57.168
we just replace that one word money from
canceled orders with the mathematical

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.323
expression we know that it's equal to. But
we need to do one thing to change this

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:04.516
equation. We need to add parenthesis
around 3w+12n.

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:08.443
Now the reason we need to do that is
because we know what we want to subtract

00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:12.844
the entire amount of money that Grant
would have earned from the orders that are

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:17.187
now cancelled. So to show that this is one
quantity, one sum of money, the money he

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:21.405
would have earned from the wipers and the
money he would have earned from the

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:23.532
nozzles, we put parenthesis around it.
