00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.830
So now that we have completed our update function which takes a year,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.650
filters our data, updates our data bind, removes and

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.410
circles that the previous updated data bind would cause to be irrelevant,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.510
access through the exit selection, add any new circles that need to be on

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.600
the page based on what happened in the updated data bind by

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.430
simply taking the enter selection and appending circles.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.340
And then effectively filtering the countries we show by changing the styling,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.780
such that only the countries that had a team in the World Cup are shown.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.660
So just to recap where we are, we completed the first task that we needed to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.200
get done before we could animate our map by writing an update function

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.650
that takes a single year and manipulates the elements on our map.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.780
To properly represent the given year and the attendance in that year.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.960
Remember, the second part of animating our map,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.220
was to simply cycle over all the years of the World Cup.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.260
There are many ways to perform the type of animation that we want to do in d3,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.620
but for simplicity's sake, I'm going to use one of the most explicit,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.170
even though there's more efficient and robust ways to do this.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.620
I've linked to a few examples in the instructor notes with some

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.200
resources an tutorials that cover other ways to create animations in D3
