00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.361
This expression equals the log of base 10 of x squared minus 16. Here's one

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:11.862
logarithm and one expression. Now that's great reasoning if you figured this

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:18.230
one out. You really just want to multiply the x plus four times the x minus 4.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.416
Since we have two logarithms added together with the same base, we just

00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:26.906
multiply these two arguments together. So we'll have the log of base 10 of this

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:31.919
entire product. This is a difference of square pattern. A plus B times A minus

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.094
B, so we'll know when we multiple we'll get A squared minus B squared. For x

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:43.617
squared minus 16. We also want to be very careful. This might be confusing,

00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:47.771
because we're not sure if we're taking the log of base 10 of x squared, or the

00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:53.665
log of base 10 of this entire quantity. That's why it's best to use parentheses

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:57.906
when you want to indicate that. Here I would think I am taking the log of base

00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:02.970
10 of x squared finding this number and then subtracting 16. But really I

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.596
want to take the log of base 10 of this entire number. Whatever x squared minus

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:11.794
16 turns out to be. That's just a word of caution when reporting your final

00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:15.520
answers. Be sure you know what you're taking the log of.
