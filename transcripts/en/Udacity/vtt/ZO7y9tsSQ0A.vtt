00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.510
Since the general pattern continues to hold after conditioning on

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.340
each of the buckets of year joined, we might increase our

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.450
confidence that this observation isn't just an artifact of the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.570
time users have had to accumulate friends. Let's look at this

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.170
relationship in another way. We could also look at tenure

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.450
and friend count as a rate instead. For example, we could

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.880
see how many friends does a user have for each

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.190
day since they've started using the service. Let's see if you

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.160
can create a summary of this rate, that shows how many friends a user

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.680
has for each day since the user started using Facebook. Subset the data so

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.530
you only consider users with at least one day of tenure. Once you have

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.330
that summary answer these two questions. What's

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.900
the median rate? And, what's the maximum rate?
