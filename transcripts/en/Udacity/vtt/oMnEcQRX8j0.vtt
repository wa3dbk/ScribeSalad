00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:03.923
So part of the motivation is going to be ease of programming.

00:00:03.923 --> 00:00:09.648
So how is it specifically easier for someone to write a program that has these irregular,

00:00:09.648 --> 00:00:15.817
complex control structures, data structures, compared to not having dynamic parallelism?

00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:22.192
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In the past, before the dynamic stuff on Keppler,

00:00:22.192 --> 00:00:30.367
which is a new GPU, in the past whenever you needed to make a new batch of work,

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:35.269
you had to return to the CPU, which was the master controller, to go and launch that work for you.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:41.011
So if ever in my program I reached a point where I needed that matrix inversion or that FFT to be done,

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:48.400
I had to halt my program, return to the CPU, have the CPU then launch this work for me that would complete,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.554
return back to the CPU, and the CPU would then have to restart me.

00:00:51.554 --> 00:00:57.567
In fact, if I could have to split my program in 2 around this moment where I needed this extra parallel work to be done,

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:02.471
and suddenly, instead of having 1 smooth program, I have 2 fragments of program,

00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:04.768
I have state that I have to save across the two,

00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:08.571
and then I have my CPU having to get involved to manage and marshal this work.

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:13.154
Suddenly, with the dynamic parallelism, I can just do this all compactly on the fly.

00:01:13.154 --> 00:01:16.783
If you like, the system does all that for you. It will save off your old program.

00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:21.985
It will run the new FFT for you. It will return the result to you, and it will continue where you left off.

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:26.324
So, from the programmer's perspective, I'm no longer programming in 2 places at once.

00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:30.567
I'm no longer having the GPU and the CPU both tightly bound over my execution,

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:38.502
and I no longer have to manage the portions of my program around where I need to launch this new work.

00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:43.740
I can just in-line it effectively, and it makes for a much simpler and more straightforward program.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.916
&gt;&gt;That's fantastic. And what about the performance implications?

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:51.816
&gt;&gt;There's always a performance overhead bouncing backwards and forwards between the CPU and GPU.

00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:56.151
You've got the latencies of the PCI bus, which was the communication link.

00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:59.856
You've got the overheads of shutting down your first portion of your program,

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:03.526
starting up the next portion back, and resuming right where you left.

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:08.270
So those overheads get amortized. You save, potentially, data transfer across the buses.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.037
And in a way, something I feel is actually more important than this is that with the GPU,

00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:18.441
you're always trying to get as much work on that GPU as possible.

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:24.109
You can much more easily overlap the new work that you're doing with

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.089
other stuff that's still going on in the GPU.

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:32.455
I don't have to shut down completely and fire up an FFT. I can, in-line, do all of these things while

00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:34.791
something else useful is going on at the same time.

00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:39.127
And so, this ability to asynchronously do this work from different threads all at the same time.

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:41.827
Remember you've got thousands of threads on the GPU,

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:47.657
they can all be doing this, I mean modular resources, they can all be doing this at the same time,

00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:51.912
and so you can get a much easier overlap between the different pieces of work you're doing,

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:54.216
and it's definitely much easier to keep the GPU busy,

00:02:54.216 --> 00:02:58.000
and that gives you a lot of potential for more performance.
