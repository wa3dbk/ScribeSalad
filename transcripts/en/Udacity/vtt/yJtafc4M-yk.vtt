00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.489
If we add these two times together we know they should sum to the total amount

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:08.582
of time it takes our boat to travel 12 miles. The boat can make the trip in 1

00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:13.943
hour and 4 minutes. But here's our problem, this is in hours and minutes and

00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:20.508
these units are in only hours so we can't quite set up an equation just yet. We

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:25.668
need to convert this to only units of hours. So if we want to convert this to

00:00:25.668 --> 00:00:28.640
hours, what improper fraction could we write?
