00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.160
Now let us consider another situation. Suppose that our pitcher actually

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.210
was able to walk the batter. So, now, there are runners on the first, second,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.730
ands third bases. Not just on the second and third bases, but one on the first,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.410
also. So the picture succeeded in accomplishing it's goal in the last shot.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.990
So the current situation then is discard, but this side of percept and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.840
this goal. The confidence of the working memory have just changed. Of course,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.580
the production rules capturing the pursuit of knowledge have not yet

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.300
changed. So these are exactly the same productions that we had previously.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.670
Only the contents of the working memory has changed.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.560
We now have a runner at the first as well as the second and

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.690
the third. And this exercise is very intrusting because it will lead us

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.060
to a different set of conclusions. Given the set of precepts in this goal and

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.030
the set of production rules, what operator do you think the picture will select?
