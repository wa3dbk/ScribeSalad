00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.372
The furthest left region on the number line starts at negative infinity and goes

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:09.979
up until 4. So in that region, all values of x are less than 4. The next

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:14.967
important value we have is x equals 4. Then, we have the values of x that lie

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:19.867
between 4 and 9. Next, we have x equal to 9. And lastly, the values of x that

00:00:19.867 --> 00:00:21.150
are greater than 9.
