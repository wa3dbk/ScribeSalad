00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.863
So, why did we start off with shapes? And why are these different categories of

00:00:03.863 --> 00:00:07.757
2 dimensions and 3 dimensions? Well, we first looked at this overarching, or

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:11.798
broad category called shapes. We think of shapes as being made up of curves and

00:00:11.798 --> 00:00:15.879
straight lines connected at points or vertices. Then we looked at how we could

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.126
find differences between those shapes, two dimensional, and three dimensional.

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:24.545
We were wondering, are the shapes flat or not? And, from that single question we

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:29.042
were able to make these two categories about our shapes. Well, this is also true

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:33.607
about functions. We use functions to describe particular relationships in math.

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:38.450
For this unit, we're going to focus on polynomials. Expressions with constants,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.341
with linear terms, quadratic terms, or cubic terms are all considered to be part

00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:48.056
of polynomials. Constants are numbers like 3, negative 4,or 5 halves. Linear

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:52.390
terms contain a single variable with an exponent of 1. We don't have to write

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.805
the 1 as the exponent, because we assume that's the case. A linear term might

00:00:56.805 --> 00:01:01.278
have constant terms on it or not, but it's the variable with the exponent of 1

00:01:01.278 --> 00:01:05.839
that makes it linear. Quadratic polynomials contain an x squared. And, cubic

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:10.053
polynomials, they contain a cube, or a third power. For this unit, we won't

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:14.439
focus on the graphs of polynomials. We're going to focus on working with them.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.205
So adding subtracting multiplying and dividing them. You might be wondering what

00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:23.332
some of these other functions are. They include square roots and exponentials,

00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:26.069
but don't worry about these. We'll get to them later.
