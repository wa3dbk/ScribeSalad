00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For N equals 1 it is 0.75 with 3/4 chance that particles will find themselves in B, D, or C,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and there's only a 1/4 chance that a particle is in A.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For N equals 4, it's 0.316, which is the same as 0.75^4.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For each particle we have a 75% chance to be outside A,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and 0.75^4 are the chances of 4 particles are outside A.

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
As we move on, we get 0.75^10 with a 0.0563.
