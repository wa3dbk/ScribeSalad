00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.842
In this homework assignment, we asked you

00:00:01.842 --> 00:00:06.093
to do a few optimizations. The very basic

00:00:06.093 --> 00:00:07.888
optimizations you can do are very, very

00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:13.390
simple optimizations on binary operations, on

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:16.966
basic arithmetic, and the ones we specifically

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:21.326
asked you to do are these right here as well as

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:24.684
replacing expressions with constants when

00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:28.373
applicable. So we gave you this one right here

00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:32.136
and then, to add in the others, we just do this

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.299
great big ‘else… if…’ statement. So the first

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:37.155
one, we check that the operation is times, we

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:40.481
check that A is a number and it’s a number

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.749
equal to one. And if it is, well, one times

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.062
anything is that second thing, is B. So we just

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:50.058
returned B. We don’t have to wait and run this

00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:52.617
through once we’re interpreting. That would

00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:54.532
take more effort than we need to. Now we do

00:00:54.532 --> 00:00:56.416
the same thing with the next one if B is one

00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:59.752
and A is something else. We can just return A.

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:03.149
Now we can do the same thing with addition

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.366
and 0. We just check if the operation is equal

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:08.156
to plus and that A is a number and it’s a

00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:10.730
number equal to 0, then we return B. If B is a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.153
number equal to zero, then we return A. And

00:01:14.153 --> 00:01:17.646
finally, the last one that we asked you to

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:22.617
implement is a number minus itself is 0. So

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:25.590
that’s fairly straightforward too. Check if the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.894
operation’s equal to minus and then if A

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:30.827
equals B – and remember, you can do that

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:33.536
because you can check if Python tuples are

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:37.367
equal to each other, not just numbers – then

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:41.444
we return a tuple of number and 0 to indicate

00:01:41.444 --> 00:01:44.288
the number 0 in our abstract syntax tree. Now

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:47.224
the constant folding is a little bit more work,

00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:50.764
but really not too much. First, we check that

00:01:50.764 --> 00:01:54.518
the first element of the tuples A and B are

00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:58.590
number. Then if the operation is addition, if

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.055
the operation equals plus, then we return

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:06.107
number and second element of A and B added

00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:09.598
together. So that way, we don’t have to run

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:12.688
that operation later on when we are actually

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:15.062
running the program. And we can do the same

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:17.840
thing if we check if the operation is minus,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.619
then we run – then we return tuple of number

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:24.097
and the second element of A and B subtracted

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:27.162
and similarly for multiplication. We can just

00:02:27.162 --> 00:02:28.703
do the same thing for the second elements of

00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:32.486
A and B, multiply together. And then once we

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.769
have hoped that the operations have been

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.515
optimized in some way, we wrap it back up in

00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:43.525
a binary operation and a tuple of BinOp, AOP

00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:46.451
and B, and return that. And if none of this

00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:50.175
worked, if we didn’t even get a BinOp to

00:02:50.175 --> 00:02:53.234
begin with, then we just return the expression

00:02:53.234 --> 00:02:55.473
because those are all the optimizations that we

00:02:55.473 --> 00:02:58.918
have done. So let’s try that with a few of these

00:02:58.918 --> 00:03:01.452
test cases and these are the test cases that we

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:05.322
provided you with. So we have zero, one and

00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:09.470
two, numbers equal to 0.0, 1.0 and 2.0, and a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.202
few variables that are ancient kings and

00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:14.627
queens of Persia and Macedonia – Xerxes,

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:18.080
Darius, Antiochus and Musa – and then we’re

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:21.500
going to define a plus operation, just so we

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.758
don’t have to keep writing this tuple out, and a

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:25.952
minus operation and a times operation

00:03:25.952 --> 00:03:27.801
similarly, just to save some key strokes. And

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:31.107
then we’re going to check whether an

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:34.044
expression that we’ve said, which is times 2

00:03:34.044 --> 00:03:36.510
and 0 is equal to 0. That is their optimization

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.739
actually ran. We’re going to do the same thing

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.285
with a minus operation and a slightly more

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.840
complicated operation. Expression three is

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.964
minus plus zero plus one plus two zero two.

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:50.607
That was a quite a big mouthful, so let’s go

00:03:50.607 --> 00:03:53.438
through it just a bit more in-depth. Plus two

00:03:53.438 --> 00:03:56.568
and zero, so two plus zero and then we wrap it

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:59.380
in this call to plus, so two plus zero plus one

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:02.495
and we wrap it again in a plus zero, and then

00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:05.131
we wrap all of this up and subtract two from

00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:08.092
whatever this is. So this really should just be

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:12.243
three minus two. Once you get past all of the

00:04:12.243 --> 00:04:14.557
massive amounts of parentheses. So we print

00:04:14.557 --> 00:04:16.942
out and make sure that that is indeed equal to

00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:18.813
one. We do the same thing for these

00:04:18.813 --> 00:04:22.225
expressions as well. So when we run this, we

00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:25.278
see that we pass all of our test cases. And this

00:04:25.278 --> 00:04:28.025
– our test cases involved a bunch of hand-

00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:33.168
checking, where we just made all these up and

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:35.486
hand-checked that this is what they’re suppose

00:04:35.486 --> 00:04:37.105
to be and then verified that the optimization

00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:39.201
actually does what we think it’s going to do.

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:40.698
This isn’t necessarily how you would

00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:43.733
normally do it, but it’s good enough to serve

00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:46.000
our purposes right now.
