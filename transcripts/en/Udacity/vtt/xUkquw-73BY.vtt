00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.989
Well, now I'm being tricky because 240 is in here and that's not going to be an

00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:10.414
integer standard deviation away from the mean. It's like 1.5 standard deviations

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:15.693
from the mean approximately. So then, how are we suppose to calculate the area

00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:21.420
under this curve between negative infinity and this non-integer number standard

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.597
deviation Deviations from the mean. Well, we can guess that it'll be between

00:00:27.597 --> 00:00:34.041
approximately 84 percent and 97.5 percent. 'Because we know that this is 68

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:41.032
percent between here and here. 13.5 percent here, and 2.5 % here, so there'll be

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:47.869
approximately 84 % of values between negative infinity and 226. Another way to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:54.232
look at it is since it's symmetrical, you know that 50% is less than the mean,

00:00:54.232 --> 00:01:00.602
and you know that 34 % is between the mean and one standard deviation. So 84 %

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:07.371
have less than 226 Facebook friends. If we add this section which is 13.5 % then

00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:14.082
we know that 97.5 % Are between negative infinity and 262. So, let's' call the

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:20.896
proportion p. We know that p has to be greater than 0.84, and less than 0.975.

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:27.368
But we're going to use a tool that will help us figure out, for any value, what

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:29.665
proportion will this be.
