00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.520
So far, we've only proven that
one language is unrecognizable.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.860
One technique for
finding more is a mapping reduction,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.950
where we turn an instance of one
problem into an instance of another.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.320
Formally, we say that a language A is
mapping reducible to a language B,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.700
if there's a computable function F.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.150
Where for every string w, w is in A,
if and only if, f(w) is in B.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.120
We write this relation between languages
using the less than or equal to sign.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.310
With a little m on the side to indicate
that we're referring to mapping

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.550
reducibility.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.200
It helps to keep in your
mind a picture like this.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.260
Here we have the language A,
a subset of sigma star.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.540
And here we have the language B,
also a subset of sigma star.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.280
In order for the computable
function f to be a reduction,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.770
it has to map each string
in A to some string in B.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.463
And each string not in
A to some string not in B.

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:05.524
The mapping doesn't have
to be one-to-one or onto,

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.660
it just has to have this key property.
