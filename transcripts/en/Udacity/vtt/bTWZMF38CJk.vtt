00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
Now that we know that each time this loop here runs, it puts at least 1 vertex from the minimum

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.800
vertex cover into its solution, what can we say about the running time of this algorithm here?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.480
As in the previous unit, we can express the running time actually in 2 ways.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.970
We can either use n, the size of the input, or we can use k,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.210
which is the size of a minimum vertex cover for the input graph.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.600
So when you run "Take 2" on a given input of size n,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.600
and where the size of a minimum vertex cover is k,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.550
how often is that loop here executed?

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.410
Does the loop run up to n times? So up to the number of vertices times.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.270
Does the loop run at most k times? Or does the loop run at least k times?

00:00:50.270 --> 99:59:59.000
Please select the correct answer here.
