00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.491
It may not surprise you that as humans we use short cuts to help us make

00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:08.736
decisions. Heuristics are mental short cuts that we use to help us make complex

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:12.040
decisions and judgments, and they often result in quick and efficient

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.890
decisions. Now, we'll talk about two main types of heuristics. The first is

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.527
representativeness heuristic. And here, we make estimates on the probability of

00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:27.829
an event based on how typical or representative it is of anther event. And the

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.264
second, is the availability heuristic. And we use this strategy, we rely on the

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:38.210
ease with which estimates some to mind, or how aware we're of those estimates.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.610
But let's go to Lauren for a question on the availability heuristic.
