00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.640
The other two kinds of constraints are pre and post conditions.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.050
These are used for expressing precisely what it means to use an operation

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.510
that belongs to some class. The key words here are P-R-E for pre, and post for

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.087
post. In a given, constraint, you can have one of these or both of these.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:26.440
Or you could have two constraints, one with pre and one with post in it.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.540
Preconditions says the circumstances under which it's allowed that a particular

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.100
operation to take place. Post conditions says what is the results of executing

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.070
this particular operation. Typically that means, what's the relationship of

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.620
the return value to the input parameters? However in an object-oriented language

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.890
it might also mean what are the effects on any attributes of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.260
the classes that take place because of the operation has been invoked.
