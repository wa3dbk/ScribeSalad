00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.120
Now let's illustrate Diffie-Hellman key
exchange algorithm using an example.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.640
The prime number q is 353, and

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.890
the alpha,
which is the primitive root of q, is 3.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.660
User A selects a random number,
which is a secret to herself, and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.550
this value is 97.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.030
So as you compute you, which is 3
raised to the power of 97 mod 353,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.510
and the result is 40.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.689
User B selects a random number,
which is a secret to himself and

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.160
this value is 233.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.900
And you compute YB, which is 3 raised

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.880
to the power of 233 Mod 353,
and the result is 248.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.470
And they exchange these values,
that is user A sends 40 to user B.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.450
And user B sends 248 to user A.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.877
Then user A computes the following,
Y8 rates to the power of X8.

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:06.240
In this case, will be 248 Raise
to the power of 97 mod 353.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.778
And the result is 160.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:15.690
Likewise, User B] computes you
raised to the power of XB, mod q.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.830
In this case, it is 40 raised
to the power 233 mod 353.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.540
And the result is 160.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.130
So as you can see, by exchanging you and
YB, both users A and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.200
B compute the same secret value,
which is 160.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.700
And this would become the shared
secret key between users A and B.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.060
We assume that an attacker would be
able to obtain these publicly exchanged

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.750
values which encode in public keys, and

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.630
they also know the publicly
known numbers Q and alpha.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.730
In this case, because the integers
involved are very small.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.550
It is feasible that the attacker
will be able to figure out

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.150
the secret value Xa and
Xb, which is 97 and 333.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.350
However if very large number is
involved, such as when the prime number

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.630
Q is at least 200 bits long,
then a task of finding Xa,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.400
the secret value,
from 1a the public value is not feasible
