00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.620
So here, I have redrawn our number line, and for each region, I've picked out a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.102
value to test to see whether it satisfies our inequality. First, let's test x

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:13.497
equals negative 11. Now, you might think that we need to actually plug negative

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:17.637
11 in and find out all the numbers here, but all we really care about is the

00:00:17.637 --> 00:00:21.878
sign of this entire expression. We just want to know whether or not it's

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:26.263
positive. So, what I'm going to do is just think about whether or not each of

00:00:26.263 --> 00:00:30.327
the factors here, we have 3 of them, is positive or negative. And then, of

00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:34.221
course, I also need to take into account the negative sign that's on the

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:38.566
outside. So, I'll write that one first. We have a negative sign on the outside.

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:43.408
If I plug in negative 11 here, negative 11 plus 10 is a negative number, so we

00:00:43.408 --> 00:00:48.186
have negative and negative in the numerator. And then in the denominator, we

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:52.696
have a negative number for this factor and a negative number for this factor.

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:57.298
Four negatives multiplied or divided together, gives us a positive number. So,

00:00:57.298 --> 00:01:01.543
this region works. Now, let's do the same thing for negative 5. And going

00:01:01.543 --> 00:01:05.743
through the same sorts of steps for the next 3, it turns out that only this

00:01:05.743 --> 00:01:10.013
region, the first one you found in the area between negative 2 and 2, yield

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:14.690
positive solutions. Let's check the 3 critical values this way also. Notice that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.567
when we plug in negative 10, we end up with 0 for the numerator. That means,

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:23.116
that this entire fraction can never be greater than 0. So, negative 10 is not

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:27.597
part of our solution set. Negative 2 and positive 2 each make the expression on

00:01:27.597 --> 00:01:31.737
the left-hand side contain a division by 0, so these cannot be part of our

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:35.997
solution set either. Great. So, we have these two intervals to take into

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:40.597
account. We have the interval negative infinity to negative 10, united with the

00:01:40.597 --> 00:01:44.626
interval negative 2 to 2. Awesome. That's our solution. Great job with some

00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:48.627
really tough work on quadratic inequalities and rational inequalities. I know

00:01:48.627 --> 00:01:52.226
there are a lot of steps in all these problems, but I helped you develop a

00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:55.764
little bit of independence in figuring out how to solve these kinds of

00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:59.765
inequalities. They're pretty cool, too. I'm going to do one more quick thing and

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:02.740
show you graphically what this inequality might look like.
