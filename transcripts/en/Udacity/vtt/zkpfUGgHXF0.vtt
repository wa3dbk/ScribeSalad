00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.230
Now let's take a look at macro viruses.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.960
First, what is a macro?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.580
A macro is actually a program
embedded in a document,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.830
such as a Microsoft Word Document.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.970
It typically contains instructions for

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.440
some useful functions, such as opening
a file or starting a new application.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.200
And because a macro is
an executable program,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.210
it can be infected by viruses just
like any other executable programs.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.480
What's unique about macro viruses is
that users typically don't suspect that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.840
a document will contain a virus.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.880
Here's how a macro virus
can typically spread.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.000
First, the attacker creates
a macro that contains a virus and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030
then attach it to a Word Document.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.350
And then this document
can be sent around, for

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.740
example, through e-mail attachment.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.460
And then, when an unsuspecting user
clicks on the e-mail attachment and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.970
opens the document, the document
is opened on the user's computer.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.420
When the document is opened,
the macro executes and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.370
as a result, the macro virus also runs.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.510
The virus then copies itself
to the global macro file.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.730
When the document opens, the macro
executes and the macro virus also runs.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.380
When the macro virus runs,
it can perform a number of malicious

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.000
activities, such as sending
the same Word Document

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.910
to a number of users in the user's
address book as an attachment.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.470
And the spreading itself.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.220
What's more interesting is that
the macro virus can copy itself to

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.160
the global macro file.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.430
As a result whenever the user
opens a new document or

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.170
creates a new document, the global macro
will be copied into the document, and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.050
that's another way that
the macro virus can spread.
