The next thing is, who are my customers? Who are they and why would they buy?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And as you'll hear a number of times, your customers do not exist to buy, you exist for them.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And what you're going to do by getting out of the building is figuring out

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
all their geographic, social characteristics, demographics such that you actually could

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
draw and put up a picture on your wall of who the archetype is  or who the persona

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is of your customer, but it turns out that in most start ups you might have more than

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
one or two or three types of customer archetypes than personas,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but you need to understand them in detail, and there is no possible way you could have anything

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but a hypothesis on day one of who they are.
