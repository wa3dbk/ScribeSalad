Let's get a little more familiar with the Grand mean, and what that really

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:08.548
means. Let's say we have two or more samples, and we find the mean of each

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:14.105
sample. Will the mean of sample means in the case of four samples, the sum of

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:21.131
the sample means divided by 4, be the same as the mean of all values? In each

00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:25.100
sample. Always, sometimes, or never.
