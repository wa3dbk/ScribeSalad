00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Since we'll be working on problems with graphs in this course,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.840
we need to find a way to efficiently represent them in a program.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.580
There are a lot of different ways doing this and they're really based on certain tradeoffs

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.040
such as memory requirements, speed of certain operations, modifying the graph,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.110
determining the neighbors of a vertex, etc.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.530
And what you want to do and how you want to represent them

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.290
really depends on the specific problem you're talking about.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.720
But let's take a look at a fairly simple way of representing a graph

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.720
and that's called an adjacency matrix.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.390
An adjacency matrix specifies which vertices are connected to which other vertices.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.420
So let's go ahead and explain by building this adjacency matrix for this graph.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:56.300
So let's look at A. Well, A isn't connected to A and we're going to represent that by writing down 0.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.780
A, however, is connected to B and we're going to specify that by putting a 1 in this location.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.950
Similarly, A is connected to C and A is not connected to D, at least not directly.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.100
And that's really what an adjacency matrix cares about.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.970
All right. So an adjacency matrix is really pretty simple.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.780
You just put a 0 everywhere where one of the vertices, the row vertex,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.400
is not connected to the column vertex and vice versa since there's no direction here.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.400
And you put a 1 everywhere where the row vertex is connected to the column vertex.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.280
And so you see that the matrix is symmetric. That is, it's mirrored right about the diagonal here.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.080
So A is connected to B, which means that well B is also connected to A.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.090
It's not necessarily the case if you have a direction on each of these arrows

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.520
but we're not going to worry about that right now.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.480
Now what I'd like you to do is give me the best possibly O notation running time

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.560
for each operation below.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.500
We're going to assume a graph with n vertices represented as an adjacency matrix.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.400
We're also going to assume that the time it takes to access any particular element

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.220
is constant and that the memory needed to represent the list of elements is order n.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.360
So give me the big O notation of the time it takes to represent all of these.
