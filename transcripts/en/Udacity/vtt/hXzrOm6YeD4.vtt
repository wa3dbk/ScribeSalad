Starting with this first equations up
here, we see that we have 3x+4 equals

00:00:04.712 --> 00:00:10.075
smiley face. 3x has a 3 in it, but this is
multiplied by x. A term like this, even

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:15.725
though there is a number in it, is called
a variable term. Because its whole value

00:00:15.837 --> 00:00:20.565
is going to change or vary depending on
what number we plug in for x. This is

00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:25.406
definitely a variable term, 4 is just a
number so no check there and finally, we

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:29.971
have a smiley space. That means, it must
be a variable. And we can go through the

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:34.875
other three equations in the same way
turn-by-turn to figure out what should be

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:38.670
checked. And know that there are some
things down here that we haven't talked

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:42.520
explicitly about yet, and that might have
thrown you off. Like, we have a fraction

00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:46.095
right here and we have a couple of
expononents, but we'll get to those things

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:49.320
pretty soon. And understanding the
difference between variable and

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:53.345
nonvariable terms is really important for
understanding everything that we're going

00:00:53.357 --> 00:00:56.770
to do in Algebra. That means we're off to
a great start in developing our

00:00:56.782 --> 00:00:57.295
foundation.
