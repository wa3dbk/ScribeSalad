00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.436
When we put all these pieces together, what we get is actually a function. We

00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:08.670
can tell, since it passes the vertical line test. This kind of function is

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.927
called a Piecewise function because, well, it's defined in different pieces.

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:16.227
Since different functions are defined in different parts of the domain, there

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:19.427
have to be at least two different equations defined in different parts of the

00:00:19.427 --> 00:00:24.446
domain for a function to be considered a Piecewise function. What I'd like to

00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:27.935
know, is what part of the domain each of these functions occupies? I'm going to

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:30.725
switch over to Piecewise function notation right now so that you can get an

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:34.522
idea of what that looks like. So this is what typical Piecewise function

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:38.186
notation looks like. You can see that instead of separate equations for each

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:41.450
part of the line over here, we've effectively merged them into one using this

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.300
brace, this curly thing right here. This shows that all of these different

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.724
function pieces are part of a single function f of x. Now the other important

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:55.384
feature of Piecewise function notation, is this section over here to the right.

00:00:55.384 --> 00:01:00.150
This is where we show the domain that each part of the function occupies.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.186
Often, you'll see a comma used between the equations for the different parts of

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:07.294
the functions and their domain. But sometimes you'll see the word for written

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:11.450
in here instead like this. To save space, I'm going to use commas right now.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.180
But either way is acceptable. Now, looking at the graph, and thinking back to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.025
what you learned about Grant's tax brackets before. Please fill in the

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:22.175
different numbers that belong in these boxes to show what the domain of each

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:26.326
piece of the function is. Now I've been nice, and I've already filled in the

00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:29.749
inequality signs for you, so all we need here are the numbers.
