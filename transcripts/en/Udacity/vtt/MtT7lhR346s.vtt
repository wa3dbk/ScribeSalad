00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.550
Okay, in this lesson, we will explore how lookup tables in routers are designed

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.410
and how longest prefix match works. We'll

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.440
explore exact match versus longest prefix match

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.010
and when each is used. We'll explore IP address lookup in more depth. And

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.230
finally, we'll explore how longest prefix match

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.220
is implemented in the form of tries.
