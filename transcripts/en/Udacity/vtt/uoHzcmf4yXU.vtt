00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.500
Now hopefully you have a little more context into the process

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.340
of projecting three dimensions into two for the purpose of creating a map.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.230
And now we can begin drawing our world map in d3.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.580
So to recap, we have a GeoJSON file, world_countries.json, that

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.250
we load in with our typical D3 JSON data loading file.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.460
Calling our function draw once all the data's loaded.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.040
And in our draw function, we've already set up the Mercator projection.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.990
Now, we need to draw the SVG path to actually visualize the map.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.600
Think of the projection in this case analogous to the scales we

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
used for our chart.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.920
With scales, we converted a data value.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.170
Either an integer or a float into a pixel value.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.950
The mercator projection, while internally,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.140
is much more complicated than something like a linear or logarithmic scale,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.030
performed the exact same function, given a coordinate of longitude and latitude.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.270
It spits back an x and y pixel.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.370
And to actually create the SVG object.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.270
That will represent the polygon of our map.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.810
We used D3's geo.path.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.810
Now even though the projection converts from longitudes and latitudes.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.550
Into the pixel domain, we still need to construct the SVG objects, to correctly

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.174
render those pixels, and that's exactly what the D3.geo.path does.

00:01:40.174 --> 00:01:45.200
And to let it know we're using the Mercator projection,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.690
we can simply call the .projection method on the path,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.390
passing in the projection we would like to use.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.360
So let's put all these pieces together to actually draw the map with our data.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.740
This bit of code I added should look very familiar to you by now, and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700
is similar to the code we used to draw our chart.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.794
First, we select all of the paths in this case,

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:14.920
in our SVG since those are what were going to be adding.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.430
And bind our GeoJSON data to this empty selection, it's empty

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.580
again since it's the first time we're drawing the map on our page, and notice

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.201
here that I'm not just using geo_data, but I'm using the .features already.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.476
Remember geo_data actually at two top level keys.

00:02:35.476 --> 00:02:42.010
And the .features key corresponded to the array of country coordinates.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.070
And now with our bound data.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.260
And again remember that this is an array of placeholder elements.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.000
We then make the enter selection to select all the paths of countries.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.620
That are not currently not on the page,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.080
which is all of them since this is the first time we're drawing the map.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.050
And for each of this, we want to append the path to our

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.780
SVG that has its d property set to this path object we created above.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.940
SVG path elements are quite flexible and can represent most any shape, and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.800
you simply pass the S series of vertices or points in the d attribute that can

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.160
be thought of as the data of the path, to specify the SVG path to actually draw.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.570
Notice here that we simply pass.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.630
The d3 path object without any arguments or

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.870
without using any callback successor function.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.530
How does it know which country to draw then?
