The graph of f inverse is the reflection in the line y equals x of the graph of

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:09.960
f. If we draw the line y equals x on our graph over here, we can see that it

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.220
cuts the picture in half. This half is identical to this one, just a mirror

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.574
image. This part of the original function also matches perfectly with this part

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:24.924
of its inverse. The statement that we have over here that f inverse is the

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:28.582
reflection in the line y equals x of f is actually true of any function of

00:00:28.582 --> 00:00:34.814
inverse, not just these two lines. This is a result of the fact that inverses

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:39.927
are the same equations just with x and y switched. It always amazes me to see

00:00:39.927 --> 00:00:44.508
how relationships between graphs reflect relationships between equations.
