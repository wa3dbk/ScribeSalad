00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.929
Now we have our t statistic. Positive and negative 2.58 are both acceptable

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.914
t-statistics, since we're doing a two-tailed test. If we were doing a

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:14.290
one-tailed test, then we would only be concerned with one direction. Now we

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.868
need to compare this to the t-critical value. Use the t-table to find the

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:24.860
critical values for a two-tailed test at alpha equals 0.05. Remember that the

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.270
degrees of freedom is the sum of the sample sizes minus 2.
