00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Just some tactics in figuring out pains, how to rank each pain that your products

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and/or services kill, according to the intensity for the customer, and what you are looking for

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is trying to understand--"Is this a lifesaving pain" or "Yeah, you know I'd live with this for years--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we could live with it for another couple of years."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
How important is it in the list of pains that customers have in the area that you're serving.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the other thing you want to think about is not only how intense is the pain

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but how often does it occur.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If it occurs just once a year, people might live with it, but if it's occurring daily or hourly,

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you are maybe solving something pretty important.
