00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Aanswer to our quiz--we can find this out by running delta debugging.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here we are again in our editor, and now we simply invoke ddmin on the HTML input

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to find out which part of the input actually causes the program to fail.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You press on run and here we go.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It takes 10 tests until delta debugging has simplified the input just to two characters

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and this is a quote and a less than sign.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
These two characters already sufficed to trigger the failure.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This simplified input dramatically reduces the number of steps it takes us

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to go through the remove HTML model fashion.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We have a quote--if a quote becomes set, this is the error.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Since quote is set, tag does not become true and the quote gets added to the result,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which causes the assertion to fail.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Just two characters, fewer steps, smallest state--all of these are advantages of a simplified input.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And just for the record, the correct answer is double quote and less than sign.
