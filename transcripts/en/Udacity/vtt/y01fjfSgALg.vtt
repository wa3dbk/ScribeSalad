00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're going to start by picking a random d that has to be relatively prime to φ(n).

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can pick random numbers and test that this property holds and pick again if it doesn't.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Since d is relatively prime to the totient of n,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that means it has a multiplicative inverse in that group.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So we can find some value e such that d is equal to 1 mod φ(n).

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There exists some value e such that de is congruent to 1 mod φ(n).

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now the question is given d and the totient of n

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is it hard to compute e?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The choices are, yes, it'd better be hard. Otherwise RSA would be insecure.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
No, it's easy. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to do this.

00:00:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Or three--no, it's easy. We can just divide the φ(n) by d.
