00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.065
Here the only solution is x equals positive 5. Nice solving if you found this

00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:09.950
number. First we'll take our quadratic equation, and we'll subtract 15 from

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.998
both sides in order to set it equal to 0. So we'll have x squared minus 2x

00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:23.130
minus 15 equals 0. Now we've factored this quadratic to give us the two factors

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.580
x minus 5 times x plus 3. Next, we said each factor equal to 0 and then we

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:36.058
solve for the values of x. So x can be positive 5 or x can be negative 3. When

00:00:36.058 --> 00:00:39.066
considering these values for solutions, we want to think back to the original

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:43.822
equation. If we plug in a negative 3, in for x, then this argument would be

00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:49.984
negative, an this one would be as well. Remember, we can't take the logarithm

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:56.346
of a negative number. So that means this solution is out. This is why the only

00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:59.363
answer is x equals positive 5.
