00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now what happens in the network is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
at each time step a new block is created

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that validates all the transactions in that block.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
At the point where this block is created,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this has to be the longest block chain.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's the way that Bob can validate

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that this was a valid spend.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Someone could try to create an alternate block chain.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So if Bob wants to spend the coin twice,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
what Bob would need to do is create a chain

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that's longer than the longest chain.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
When a transaction's validated by the network,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
all the signatures in the coin are checked.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is using the transfer chain,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but to prevent double spending

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
there's also a check of this chain of blocks.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And the check is: the longest chain is the one that's viewed as correct.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So each peer in the network might see a different view of this chain of blocks.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If they see different views, the one that has the longest chain

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is the one that will be viewed as the most correct view of all the transactions.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So every participant in the network

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is effectively keeping track of all transactions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And the version of all transactions that people trust the most

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
is the one with the longest chain,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and if an adversary wants to create a longer chain

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
with a different view of transactions--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
so if Bob wants to double spend this coin and, say,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
give the same coin to both Cathy and Doug,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
what Bob would need to do is create a longer chain

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that convinces Doug that this is the correct view of the network

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and this view is incorrect.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So that requires finding these hash values.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If the power of the network exceeds the power of the adversary,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
well then it's likely the network will have

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
a longer chain than the adversary can produce.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Keep in mind, the motivation for producing this attack

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is just to be able to double spend one coin.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There's still the chain of public key signatures

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that validates the transfers of each coin.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So the resources that you would need to spend to produce a longer chain

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to convince someone that you didn't spend that coin

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in the other chain, which is now the one that would've included the previous spend

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
is to find these hash values quicker than the network can.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Then centers are set up in such a way

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to make it unlikely that someone will want to do that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
since if you do find that next hash value in the chain,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you can create a new block, which is worth 50 bit coins

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If you create a longer chain

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
trying to catch up to the chain that the network has,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that's going to require a lot more computing resources,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and would only allow you to respend

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
the bit coins that you already owned.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So this doesn't provide anonymity in the traditional sense.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It avoids the need for a central authority,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
but each transaction is known to everyone in the network.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The way to provide some anonymity is,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
instead of using your actual names in the transactions,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
you can have different identities for each transaction.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So this is gonna be some new identity.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It will still need to have a certificate

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that validates the public key for that,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but it doesn't need to be tied to Alice's identity

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in any way that's visible to anyone else.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So that's the way to provide some anonymity,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
even though all the transactions in the network are public

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
to everyone who participates.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So this actually works.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
There's at least a reasonable number of people

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that trust this currency

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and are providing computation

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to create these blocks,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which is incentivized by creating the value of new bit coins.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
There's about 9 million bit coins currently available.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And the marketplace fluctuates, and it depends on cost of computation

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
as well as the trust in the bit coin network.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
There have been some incidents where the price fluctuated wildly

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
because there was some concern about the security of the bit coin transaction site

00:03:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but the current market is fairly stable around $5 for a bit coin.
