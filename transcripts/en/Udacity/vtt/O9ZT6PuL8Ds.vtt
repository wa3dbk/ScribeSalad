00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.990
We've got sign up and login working.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.630
So I think the next task is
to implement logging out.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.620
I'd also like to implement what
happens when the user gets kicked off.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.270
So when can a user be kicked off?

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.870
Well, usually when a user logs in they
don't stay logged in for ever and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.810
ever and ever.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.960
And you can actually control how long
Firebase will allow you to have a logged

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.850
in user via the dashboards session
length property right here.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.320
Just get to it by clicking
on the login and off tab.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.440
Selecting a value here
affects all forms of login.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.880
I'm going to go ahead and
set this to one month.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.120
Now being kicked off
is an automatic thing,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.320
whereas logging out is something
that you choose to do.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.060
But both of these two actions
should have the same effect.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.580
And that is to clear the user data
out of shared preferences and

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.310
to take you back to the login activity.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.570
Both of these actions will also
trigger an AuthStateListener.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.470
So we can take the code
that does this and

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.170
put it inside of the AuthStateListener
and then we'll be set in both scenarios.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.780
Now being kicked out because of
session time-out is something that

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.380
Firebase handles for you, but you're
going to need to hook up the login

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.240
button to have the correct behavior.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.190
To log out a user you simply need
to get a Firebase reference and

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.680
call unauth on it.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.870
That'll log out whatever user
is logged in on the client.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320
I've already written the log
out menu option for you.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.560
You just need to make it visible.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.020
And I'll send over more details
about that in the spec.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.460
Hopefully that's enough
to get you started.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.020
And good luck.
