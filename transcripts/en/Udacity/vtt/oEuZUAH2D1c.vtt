00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.469
Easy peasy lemon squeezy. First thing we do is actually called

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.620
gPhysicsEngine.create, inside the setup function for the game engine class. And

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.334
at the bottom of the update loop, we call gPhysicsEngine.update. We can create

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:15.470
the engine, update the engine, all the entities in flight can create objects.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.010
We're good to go.
