00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's come up with some

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
concrete equations for derivatives.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For instance, if this equation describes

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the dependence of my position on time,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the position should be (t + 1)³.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Actually, we are ignoring physical

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
units of measurement right now.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What would the rate of change be?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's magnify a portion of that curve.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's saying this is some time t,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and this is, a little later, t + h.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Throughout this course, h will denote

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a small increment of time.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Then the x value here

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is (t + 1)³,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the x value here

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is (t + h + 1)³.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And the question now is

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
what the rate of change is.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What you're interested in is the ratio

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of the gain in x to the timestep that we're making.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This side obviously has a length of h,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and this side has a length of

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
(t + h + 1)³ - (t + 1)³.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So let's write down the ratio--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
[(t + h + 1)³ - (t + 1)³]/h.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now comes the question,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
if h is really small,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
what would this expression become?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Would it become t + something that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
can be neglected for every tiny h?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Would it become (t + 1)² + something that we can neglect,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
3t² + something that can be neglected

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
or 3(t + 1)² + something we can neglect?
