00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.200
Now that we've covered
activity content transitions,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.870
let's move on to shared
element transitions.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.930
Let's start off by taking
a look at why they're useful.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.990
Now when changing the state of your UI,
motion can help you to explain

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.530
that change as well as focus your
attention on the content that matters.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.170
So, in this example, the album cover
remains throughout the transition

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.180
between an artist's screen and album
screen, smoothly moving into place.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.230
The transition is organized around
the object that you selected, and

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.060
it unfolds from your touch.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.190
It helps to keep you oriented.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.270
We call this a shared element
transition as the album cover

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.740
is shared across the two states.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.200
Even if your UI doesn't
include rich imagery for

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.110
you to transition between states,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.390
you can use these same principles to
convey navigational relationships.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.940
In this example, clicking on an item
in the list causes it to lift up,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.720
forming its own surface,
and then expand into place.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.580
This reinforces the parent
to child relationship.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.250
That you're drilling down into an item.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.489
The motion guides the user
between the two states.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.720
We can also take advantage of
this advanced paper material

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.090
which can transform its size and
shape and position.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.890
This helps us to move between
states within a screen,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.300
not just across screen boundaries.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.030
So in this example,
clicking on an event in your calendar.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.990
The material lifts up into
its own separate surface and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.720
then transforms into
the Event Details page.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.790
These examples all help to provide
continuity between different states

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.770
in your UI to create a more
understandable experience.
