00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Fortunately, the answer is the third one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What you need to do to prove an upper bound are on the hardest of a problem is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
if you can find an algorithm for example that solves the problem--provably solves the problem

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and provably into the fourth time, then--well, we don't know if a faster algorithm exists

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but we know it's at least solvable in end to the fourth.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So the big O or Î˜ that we get from that is exactly the upper bound.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
These sorts of things are really helpful to do--well, actually so this first one is really helpful to do,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
running on a bunch of inputs, look at the shape of the graph.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I can give you a lot of insight that might help you decide what you want to prove about the algorithm,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but this itself doesn't really prove anything.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Running something on all possible inputs is impossible, unless it's a problem where the inputs

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
are constrained, so there's only a few possible inputs.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Generally, the running time scales with the size of the input and it can scale arbitrarily large.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And yeah, actually studying algorithms and how to analyze it is exactly what we're doing in this class
