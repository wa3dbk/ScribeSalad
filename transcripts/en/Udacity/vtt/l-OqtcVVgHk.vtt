00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.303
So, one of things when I was learning how to program was casting. And that was

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:05.383
something that [LAUGH]

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:08.893
I feel like I learned casting a little bit later than everyone else because its

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:12.349
just that it was very foreign for me to really understand like how everything

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.518
was set up initially. And so when I learned about like you know oh I have

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:21.403
variables. I got that. Okay? So, there's variables. But then you know, you've

00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:24.069
got ints you've got doubles, and that, that was one of those things I didn't

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:28.657
understand the importance of it. And for a while I kind of dismissed it as like

00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:33.253
I don't want to ask for help, like it's okay. Like I'm just going to, I'm just

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:36.340
going to go right through this, and then I'd have problems where I'd be running

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.171
my code. And then like all of a sudden I got a crazy long number back and I'm

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.528
like what did I do wrong? The person next to me just got six. How did I had,

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:48.094
how did I mess up here? And the email was one of the thing that's like, I think

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:51.154
my pride was a little bit got in the way, I probably should have just like,

00:00:51.154 --> 00:00:56.358
hey, why isn't my number working? By the time I understood, like the difference

00:00:56.358 --> 00:00:59.571
it's like a whole number versus like you know, number of the decimal like the

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:04.906
know like oh, I get it, like. Now, it's just, like, instinctive. Like, whenever

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:08.598
I'm, you know, writing something, like, I know which number like, what kind of

00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:12.866
custom I have with it. And it's those little things that, like, they kind of

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.855
stand in the way, at first, where it's, it's silly looking back but, I mean

00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:20.691
once you get the, like major concepts down. It's like, you wouldn't even think

00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:25.222
twice about it. It's like, I've got a hand and well, I've got an int. [LAUGH]
