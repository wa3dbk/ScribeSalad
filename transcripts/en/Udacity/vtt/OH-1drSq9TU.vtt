00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So here's the goal of secure computation. Let's suppose Alice and Bob meet at a conference.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
They don't yet know each other despite the fact that they've been talking to each other

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
through units 1 through 6, but let's pretend they're not quite so friendly yet,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and they both have their smart phones.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
On their smart phone, they have an address book.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What they want to do is figure out, do they know any of the same people?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is a pretty common occurrence at conferences.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Often, the way people do this is the slow, "Were you ever at this place?"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Do you know someone here?" "Do you know anyone there?"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They want to do it more efficiently, so what they'd like to do is have a protocol

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that allows them to compare their address books and find all the people they know in common.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In this case, it would match Dennis since they both know the same Dennis and then they would

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
see the matches but not reveal anything else about their address book to the other person.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They want to do this by executing some protocol

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
where at the end of the protocol both parties would know the matching entries

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but not learn anything else about the other person's address book.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
More generally, we have two parties - A and B. They have some private information.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They want to perform some secure computation,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and at the end of that they learn the result of some function on both of their inputs,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but they don't learn anything about the other party's input.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now it's time for a question.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's sort of a trick question, but if you were paying attention at the beginning of this unit,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
you'll be able to answer it correctly.

00:01:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can we achieve this property using cryptography?
