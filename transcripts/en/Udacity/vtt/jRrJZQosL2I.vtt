00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.572
Instead of having P-squared threads to compute P-squared force interactions

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:08.546
and then summing them up between threads, we'll only use P threads total.

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:12.846
Each of these P threads will then be responsible for P interactions.

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.386
Another way to think about it is that 1 thread, this horizontal thread here,

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:22.995
is responsible for applying the force of all P source objects to 1 destination object.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:25.128
So the code for this is really simple, and we're showing it here.

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:29.475
Our kernel code simply loops N over P times over this particular routine.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:33.663
It accumulates P by P interactions onto P threads in each iteration.

00:00:33.663 --> 00:00:35.673
So what's happening in this code?

00:00:35.673 --> 00:00:40.616
Well the input to the kernel is my parameters, those associated with my destination object.

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:44.143
Those would be say, your position and your mass or your charge

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:47.384
and the accumulated force that has acted on my object so far.

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:51.608
And the output will be the accumulated force after I add in P more interactions,

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:54.788
1 for each of the source objects with which I'm interacting.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:59.195
So we assume that we store parameters for the P source objects in shared memory,

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:00.895
sourceParams here,

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.199
and then we just loop P times over those P objects.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.980
We compute the interaction, and this might be computation of gravitational force, it might be electrostatic force,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.675
and the params will differ depending on what kind of force it is.

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:17.194
And then we'll compute the interaction and add resulting force into the force accumulator variable and return it.
