00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.650
You are doing awesome work.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.780
To recap, let's talk a little
bit about what you've done.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.410
So the first thing that you did is you
defined a rule structure at that mirrors

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.950
our actual database.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.420
Then, using that rule structure,
you created validations for

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.050
both properties and entire objects.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.440
Next we figured out what kind of read
and write rules that you need for

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.060
each root node.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.560
And that's all been laid out for
you in a spec.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
So now we're ready to actually implement
those rules, of course using those handy

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.820
UID mapping and
owner mapping rules that you just made.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.740
But before I throw you in the wild
of writing read and write rules,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.140
I wanted to give you a couple of tips
and tricks about troubleshooting.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.650
Because you might be wondering,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.500
how do you actually test
a rule when it's not working?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.640
So my first tip is a oldie but
a goodie, and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.120
it's basically to turn
on the debug mode.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.340
This gives you access to
all sorts of good data.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.360
In the case of a read,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.120
it will show you the exact location
you're trying to read from.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.370
And in the case of write, it'll show
you the exact data that you're sending

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.500
to the app, that might or
might not be getting denied.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.300
In addition though, Firebase actually
provides you with a simulator to test

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.760
out reading and writing data.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.610
And the simulator's pretty
cool because it allows you to

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.470
very clearly see what's
happening with your permissions.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay.
So, in the Firebase dashboard,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.020
you can go ahead and go over to this
Simulator tab and, for our app,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.910
because login is so important, you're
going to want to select a Custom Auth.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.790
The provider doesn't,
matter but the UID does.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.260
This will make it so that when
you're using your read/write rules,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.450
in this case the provider
isn't important, but

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.030
you should put in a UID of
a pre-existing user in your app.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.445
In my case, I'm going to go ahead and
put in UID.

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:37.972
And I just copied and
pasted this over from my data here,

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:42.050
where if you look at the UID mappings,
you can grab her UID.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.890
Okay, so I put in UID, and
I can press Authenticate.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.730
And this will basically make it so
I am impersonating.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.190
And then, here, I can simulate
different read or write rules.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.140
Write rules allow you to also specify
some data that you tring to write.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.980
So, for example, if you wanted to
test that rule that you just created,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.370
you could find a shopping list that
is shared on, another list that she's

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.320
the owner of, and finally a list
that she has nothing to do with, and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.880
make sure that they all
give the correct responses.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.600
So, for example, I'm going to get
a shopping list that is shared on.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.430
So over here I'm looking at lists.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.796
Okay, here's one that she shared on,
and it has the name K7J0.

00:02:23.796 --> 00:02:27.094
So I'll go over here to shopping
list items, go to list K7J0,

00:02:27.094 --> 00:02:30.410
and then I'll go ahead and
open that link in the other tab.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.120
I'll copy this location, and
then over here in the simulator

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.940
I can put that location
that I just copied here.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.400
So basically, I'm now doing a simulated
read for shopping list items for

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.610
that list that she was shared on.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.670
Okay, and
I'm already authenticated as her.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.474
So, I could come down here,
and I'm authenticated as.

00:02:48.474 --> 00:02:50.760
I'm trying to read at this
list that she's shared on.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.650
I can press simulate read, and
it says here that the read is allowed.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.110
It even goes through each of
the rules of these different steps.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.750
So you get a lot of output information
and it will tell you, actually, if there

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.840
are multiple rules along the path, which
one it passes and which one it fails.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.997
So it's very useful.

00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:11.264
And so, similarly, I can take
a list that she's not a part of,

00:03:11.264 --> 00:03:13.720
which she's not a part of this list.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.310
And I can simulate a read.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.800
And it would show that
the read was denied, and

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.210
point out which of
these rules was false.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.640
Finally, Bolt could be
a pretty helpful tool for

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.980
writing rules,
including read and write rules.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.150
As I mentioned, checking whether
a user is shared on the list, or

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.620
the owner of a list,
is a fairly common rule.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.655
You've also probably seen that
it's a little bit long to write.

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:34.540
Bolt allows you to write functions, and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.950
then use those functions
in different places.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.730
And this is, essentially,
gives you a pretty easy way to make

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.450
fairly similar rules in a bunch of
different parts of the rule stock.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.630
So here's a quick example of a function
in Bolt, and I'm not going to go over

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.300
the semantics of all the [INAUDIBLE] to
some of the bolt documentation for that.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.540
But, basically, it's doing the look
up in that UID mappings table

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.400
to get you the encoded email.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.390
And here's another function, which when
passed in a ListID parameter, it goes

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.890
into the owner mappings node and gets
you back the owner email for that list.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.180
And here's yet another function which
combines these two other functions

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.760
to get your encoded email and
compare it to the email of a list.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.660
So, you might write up a bunch
of functions in Bolt, and

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.620
then in your paths part of your Bolt
file, you can write something like this.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.000
And what this rule is
basically doing is saying,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.830
for a list name in
a specific shopping list,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.340
the owner of that shopping list is the
only one who can change the list name.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.420
And while he had to write
all these functions,

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.670
you can now use this owner function
in as many places as you want.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.450
So there might be ten places in the app
that you want to check for ownership.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.270
All you have to do now is write
this isOwner function call.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.830
A full explanation of writing
functions in Bolt is accessible in

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.390
the instructor notes, but

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.240
hopefully this is enough to prove to you
that using Bolt might be a good idea.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.570
So now that you know the different
options for troubleshooting and

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.700
debugging your rules, do you think that
you could write the rest of the read,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.030
write, and validate rules that I'm
giving you in the spec right now?
