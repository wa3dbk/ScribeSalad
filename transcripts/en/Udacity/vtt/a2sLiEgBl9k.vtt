00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, here's 1 version of this function.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
First, what we do is we take the month string from the user, if it's there,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
if it's a nonempty string.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I capitalize it because the list I include before of all of the months

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
has the days capitalized,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and if that capitalized month is in that list, return that value.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So let's try a couple versions of this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Valid_month('january'), and we run this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We see it prints January.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's try 'july'. I run this, and it prints July.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Everything is formatted nicely, and all is well.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Okay, now let's try answering some junk in here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Okay, we run this, and it returns nothing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What happens if I answer in nothing?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We get nothing. Okay, so this seems to be working.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now what if we wanted to make this a little bit more user friendly,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
so the user doesn't have to type in a complete month and spell it correctly.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Here's the change I would probably make.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
At the top of this file, we have a list of months.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What I'm going to do is, I'm going to build a dictionary--a mapping of just the first 3 letters

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
of the month name to the month name itself,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so we're only going to match on the first 3 letters of what the user enters.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Okay, so I've added this dictionary, and for m in months,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which is our list from above of the month names,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we're going to make a mapping of the first 3 letters of that month--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that's what this m[:3] is--lowercase using the lower() function to the month name itself.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If I were to print that out, it looks like this down here--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
'mar' to March, 'feb' to February, 'aug' to August--you get the point.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now this isn't in any particular order because in Python, dictionaries aren't ordered.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now let's update the main function here to use this new dictionary.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Okay, so now I've made the changes. We still say, if month.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now I'm making a new variable called short_month,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which just equals the first 3 letters of whatever the user typed in, lowercased--

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so first 3 letters, lowercase.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Then I use the GET function on a Python dictionary to see if those first 3 letters

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the user typed in is in that mapping, and if it is, we return the value from that mapping.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That's what the GET function does.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It says, if our key is in the mapping, return the value. Otherwise, return none.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We're going to return either that value or none.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Let's try this out together.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So print valid_months.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Okay, so I run this function on 'january', like we did before, and it prints out January

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
with a capital J. That's the behavior we had before.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Let's try something a little bit different. What if I type in just 'feb'?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
If I run this, we get February with a capital F, so now our date field in our form

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
will be able to accept a wider variety of things.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If you're like me, and you can never spell February correctly--I'll misspell this,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I hit run, we still get February nicely.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is nice, so I can type in any sorts of junk,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and if the first 3 letters match a month, we can assume the user was probably

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
on the right track. Okay? See--December.
