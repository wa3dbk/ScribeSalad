00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.390
Attackers can also use denial
of service attacks to disrupt

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.020
the network intrusion detection process.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.260
Similar to denial of service attacks on
a network server such as a web server,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.930
an attacker can send a lot of
traffic to the IDS to process.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.620
The result is resource exhaustions,
for example, in CPU memory and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.070
network bandwidth.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.800
In other words, the network IDS may
not be able to analyze traffic and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.840
such traffic may contain actual attacks.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.323
That is, the attacker can first
denial service the IDS and

00:00:34.323 --> 00:00:37.020
then launch the real attack.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.550
Another attack approach is to abuse the
reactive nature of intrusion detection.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.330
The intrusion detection
process is reactive because

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.840
when the IDS outputs an alert, the
security admin must analyze the alert.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.800
Therefore, the attacker
can send a lot of traffic

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.640
that would trigger the alerts, for

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.090
example, by crafting packets that on
purpose contain signatures of attacks.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.860
The goal is to overwhelm the response
system and the security admins.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.910
And then the attacker can send
the real attack traffic that even if

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.060
it triggers an alert, the alert
will not be acting upon in time.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.040
That is because the security admins are
so busy analyzing alerts of fake attack,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.870
the real attack is not
analyzed until it's too late.
