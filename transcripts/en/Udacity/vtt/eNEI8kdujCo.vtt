00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.340
Let's revisit the CSV baseball data that we downloaded earlier.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.450
CSV is a very popular way to store data, likely because

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.930
it's easy to read and comprehend for both humans and

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.470
computers. It also probably doesn't hurt that Microsoft Excel can export

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.330
data as a CSV. As you can see, every element

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.080
of each row is separated by a comma. If we wanted

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.070
to load this data into Pandas, we can do this

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.050
in one line. It's super easy. We simply import pandas, and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.110
then write baseball_data equals pandas.read_csv Master.csv. This will

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.800
load the comma separated data into what Pandas calls

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.930
a data frame, where we can retrieve each

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.300
column like this, print baseball_data name first. We can

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.270
also create new columns on the data frame

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.668
by manipulating the columns in a vectorized way. For

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:48.460
example, if I wanted a new column that

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.756
was the sum of each player's height and weight,

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:54.284
called baseball_data height plus weight, I could write baseball_data

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:58.310
height plus weight equals baseball_data height, plus baseball_data weight.
