This question is on Public Key Cryptography.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Suppose Alice has a public and private key pair

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and that Bob has a public and private key pair

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where we have the subscript  A for Alice and B for Bob.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Alice wants to send a message to Bob

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in a way that protects us from eavesdroppers

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and proves to Bob that the message was generated by Alice and intended for Bob.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And so the question is what message should Alice send.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
