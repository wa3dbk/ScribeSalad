00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.990
These numbers look pretty mysterious. Let's talk more about colors and what

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.590
these numbers mean. We left a few predefined colors out, here are the colors,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.370
and here are their RGB values, though they're mixed up. Can you match each set

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.400
of RGB values to its color? You can figure this out whether you remember what

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.920
magenta means or not. As a reminder to help you in your experimentation, this

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.000
is how you would write code to color a box magenta. And this is how you would

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
write code to color a box with color a.
