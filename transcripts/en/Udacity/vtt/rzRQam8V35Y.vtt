00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.719
So what have we learned from this exercise? First off, we could,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.340
we could use traditional Object Oriented Analysis. But this doesn't necessarily

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.930
always lead to the best solution. We can think instead about using use cases to

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.190
determine roles. And then use Dependency Inversion to reduce the coupling and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.980
promote reuse. And the final lesson that you can get from this is,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.780
don't try to design any programs before you've had your morning coffee.
