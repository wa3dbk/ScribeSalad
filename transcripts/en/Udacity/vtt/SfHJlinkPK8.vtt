00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.010
Given opens and closings dilations,
erosions, this hit or

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.390
miss transform that I was talking
about that pulls out the shape.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.200
You can then do further things, okay?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.010
Here's a list of them.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.210
Boundary, region, extracting connected
components, convex hull, thinning,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.090
skeletons, pruning.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.740
I'm just going to talk about two,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.270
and I'm really just going to
talk about one in detail.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.210
Not even detail, one slide's worth.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.730
And then thinning,
I'll just mention, okay?

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.290
So sometimes,
you like to extract the boundary.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.390
Well actually, that's very easy to do.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.220
What I can do is, I can take an object.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.760
If A plus B is the dilation, and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.790
A minus B is the erosion, I can get the
boundary by just taking the object and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.770
subtracting out
the eroded version of it.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.730
Here, they talk about B
being a 3 by 3 square,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.162
it could be whatever size square.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:50.670
I'm going to take the binary pixels, and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.810
I'm going to remove any of the ones that
survive the erosion process, all right?

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.770
So you want to do that, and voila.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.750
This is what you get.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.873
And you realize,
what's happening here of course,

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:02.770
is here's our original binary image.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.625
And when I erode the, you know, the
contour moves in by a certain amount.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:11.244
And if it's three by three by at
least one and a half, two pixels, so

00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:15.500
what that'll do is, if I subtract what's
inside the red from the whole thing,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.900
I end up with just this boundary.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.420
So, it's just a trivial operation right?

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.760
I, I take the image, erode it, and then
subtract those pixels, and by subtract,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.470
I mean remove those
pixels from the original.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.640
And that's how you do boundaries.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.020
There's another operation
called thinning.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.500
You'll, you'll notice
this operator here.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920
This is this hit or miss operator.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.428
What matters is,
you take your original picture and

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.000
you've got these different
structuring elements.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.672
And essentially, you keep eating away
a at your picture using that structure,

00:01:43.672 --> 00:01:47.926
that structuring elements, and
you would go from this filled in picture

00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:52.340
like this, you would end up with,
with something that's just like this.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.542
Or it's a one Ppxel wide thin band,
all right?

00:01:56.542 --> 00:02:00.390
When you keep doing the thinning, and
that can be used for finding skeletons.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.830
There used to be a lot of thought
about using skeletons for

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.340
a variety of shape representations
when we're doing models, and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.690
people still use it and
that's why I mention it.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.060
But I'm not going to talk,
anymore about it.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.360
It's just thinning and thickening.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.360
And in fact, the thickening
is just the inverse of that.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.880
So here you have this original thing,
and then you're

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.540
growing it out till you get out towards
the, the boundary of some sort.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.680
Again, I'm not going to worry
too much about the details.
