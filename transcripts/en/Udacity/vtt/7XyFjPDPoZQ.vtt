00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.740
Let's make some improvements to our scatter plot. This

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.080
time we're going to start by switching from the qplot

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.590
syntax to the more formal and verbose ggplot syntax.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.530
I mention this in Lesson 3. The ggplot syntax will

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.149
let us specify more complicated plots. So just as

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.690
a reminder, this is the qplot syntax in order

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.970
to create the scatter plot. Ggplot is another plotting

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.180
function similar to qplot, and it has slightly different syntax.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.560
Here's the equivalent code to produce this scatter plot. The main

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.740
difference between qplot and ggplot is that we have to say

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.610
what type of geom or chart type that we want. In

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.335
this case, we want a scatter plot. So we're going to use the

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:40.760
geom_point. You can see the full list of chart types in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.550
the ggplot reference, which is linked in the instructor notes. The second

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.160
big difference between the two plotting functions is that ggplot uses

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.760
this aes wrapper. We have to wrap our x and y variables

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.030
inside this aesthetic wrapper. Don't worry about this too much.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.449
We'll cover this in more depth later. Now, I want to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.573
get some ranges on my age, so I'm going to run

00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:02.169
the summary command on age to figure out the lower and

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:05.909
upper limits. The minimum age of a user is 13,

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.588
and the maximum is 113. Now, let's click the x-axis

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:13.753
at age 90 and at age 13. This seems reasonable

00:01:13.753 --> 00:01:16.585
since users who are younger than 13 are not permitted to

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:19.882
use Facebook. And we're really not that confident whether people who

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:22.562
report being older than age 90 are telling the truth. To

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:25.724
do this, we're going to use the xlim layer. Now I'm

00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:29.216
not going to pass xlim into ggplot. Instead, I'm going to use it

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:32.300
as an additional layer outside of it. Notice that we use

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.740
the plus operator to add a new layer to our figure.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.050
And this is going to change the appearance of our x-axis. I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.810
really recommend that you add one layer at a time when building

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.110
up plots. This allows you to debug and find any broken code. And there we

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.260
go. There's a nicer plot with our users ranging from 13 to 90 years old.
