00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.520
Now we know what is the information in one random

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.300
variable. Now assume that I told you to predict if you're

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.310
going to hear thunder or not. Well, that's very difficult. But

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.490
what if I tell you if it is raining or not.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.030
Your guess regarding the thunder is going to be significantly better.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.570
So there is some information in this variable that tells you

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.660
something about this variable. We can measure that in two different

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.550
ways. The first one is called as joint entropy. Joint entropy

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.440
is the randomness contained in two variables together as given

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.210
by H of X comma Y. And, as you can

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.660
predict, it is given by this particular formula, which is

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.980
the joint probability distribution between X and Y. And, as you

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.780
predicted, it is given by this particular formula where P

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.540
of X comma Y is the joint probability of X and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.970
Y. The other measure is called as conditional entropy. Conditional

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.380
entropy is a measure of the randomness of one variable given

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.018
the other variable. And it is generated by H

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:57.770
of Y given X. Now, to understand these two concepts,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.460
you have to imagine what happens when X and Y

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.660
are independent. If X and Y are independent, then the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.790
conditional probability of Y given X is just the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.800
conditional probability of Y. It's quite obvious, right. If two

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.020
variables are independent of each other, Y variable doesn't get

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.790
any information from X at all. The joint entropy between

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.560
X and Y, if X and Y are independent, is the sum of information

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.050
of both X and Y. That is why the entropies have been added here.
