00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.634
Surprisingly there is only one way to triangulate this figure. Because of the

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:10.842
deep concavity, we can't add edges here or here, as these edges are outside of

00:00:10.842 --> 00:00:16.844
the figure. Instead the only place to add edges is here and here, giving the

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:22.276
only possible triangulation. The good news is, that no matter how complex the

00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:27.012
form, any polygon can be triangulated into triangles, so it can be displayed

00:00:27.012 --> 00:00:27.844
using a GPU.
