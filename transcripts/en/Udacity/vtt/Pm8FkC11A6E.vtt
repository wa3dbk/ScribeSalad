While I don't know would have been the correct answer for me a few years ago, a

00:00:03.114 --> 00:00:07.764
more useful answer, and the correct one, is a yellow-green color. Chartreuse is

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:10.818
named after a liqueur in France. I have a theory that women know this color

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:14.556
more often than men, since it's a fabric color used in dresses. Me, I thought

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:17.654
it was a red-orange color. Crayola thought it was a yellow color for a while

00:00:17.654 --> 00:00:18.840
and revised it later.
