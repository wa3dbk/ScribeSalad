00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.950
But before I elaborate on any of these answers in our grid, let's remember what

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:09.480
the general formula for slope is. We can find two points along any of these

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:14.290
lines, and then compare them using this formula to find the slope. The first

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:19.105
line, v, is a really interesting case. If we pick any two points along it, let's

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:23.892
say negative 7,3 and negative 3,3. You'll notice that they have the same

00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:28.262
y-coordinate, they have the same vertical position. That means that our

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:32.548
numerator of our slope formula is going to be zero, since we'll just have 3

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.641
minus 3. Zero divided by any number except zero is just zero. So, the slope of v

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:42.212
is just zero. w is another really interesting case. It's this vertical line

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:47.110
right here. Although, the points along w have a wide variety of y values, they

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:51.937
all have exactly the same x value. x equals negative 5 for any point we could

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.332
place along this line. So, let's just pick 2 again. Maybe this point, negative

00:00:57.344 --> 00:01:02.715
5,6, and this point negative 5, negative 1. Then, we have negative 1 minus 6

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:07.940
over negative 5 plus 5. But, this quantity on the bottom is going to give us

00:01:07.952 --> 00:01:12.710
zero and we know that we can't divide by zero. That is just not allowed, at

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:18.150
least not for right now. So, what we say is that the slope is undefined. Line x

00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:23.305
is pointing up to the right, so its slope is positive. And if we step over one

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:28.485
to the right, we have to step up more than one to rejoin our line. So, its slope

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:33.693
is not a fraction. It's greater than one. The line y also has a positive slope.

00:01:33.808 --> 00:01:38.921
But, if we pick a point and move over one to the right, we have to move less

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:44.187
than one unit up to rejoin the graph. So, this slope is a fraction. Line z

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:49.403
points down to the right, so as we saw before, its slope is negative.
