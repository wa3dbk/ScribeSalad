00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.750
So now that we have multiple solutions,
I guess it's time to come up to

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.400
a decision, and
to come up with one solution, right?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.160
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.280
So, the decide stage is important

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.930
in helping filter down
the ideas that were collected.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.640
The previous stage,
which is about diverging,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.850
has made it so that everyone has created
a lot of sketches, and they're starting

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.820
to develop some passion and
attachment to the things that they have.

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:31.260
During the deside stage, we ask the team
to put their ideas on the board so

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.390
everyone can see them.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.070
At that point,
we ask people to remain silent.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.970
We call this process Zen Voting.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.380
Just like in a zen spirit,
you want to be quiet and

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.680
consider things in a reflective manner.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.590
During this process, we ask people
to review what the sketches

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.490
are before anyone gets to bias
them with their opinions.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.760
So, as they review the sketches
that other people have created,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.060
they start thinking, what do they
like about the other solution?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.920
And you're always curious.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.823
I made this.

00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:04.653
What did the others make?

00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:06.390
It's fun to see that.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.590
After everybody has voted, it is time
to actually discuss things in person.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.610
So, something that's not natural to
teams happened that's really valuable.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.520
People had individual,
personal time to be creative.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.250
Then they have personal time to view
results, and they have time to consider

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.120
and cast their vote before anyone else
could say, I think this is important.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.180
And so they are biased.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.810
So now that they have gone through that,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.710
they're ready to look at
things as a community.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.750
As a community,
the team reviews what are the ideas,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.570
what are the most popular ones and
then quickly they get to see

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.440
more clearly some things rise to the top
and maybe others are less important.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.420
So there minds are changed based
on what the community has decided.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.150
Research shows that this
community-based voting

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.940
can be more powerful than
the decisions of a single expert.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.900
For example,
if you have a horse race and

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.919
exports betting on the horses, and
if you have a crowdsourcing solution,

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:15.510
and you're testing how a crowd
making predictions on who will win.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.640
It is likely that the crowd
might often be the experts

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.820
over what you usually think, is that
the expert will be more powerful.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.290
Crowdsourcing a decision makes
the team decide faster and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.730
it helps the team often gather
the wisdom of everyone who is involved.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.160
&gt;&gt; So what could go wrong in this stage?

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.630
&gt;&gt; What could go wrong in this stage?

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.010
Decisions are a crucial
aspect of what teams do.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.410
In fact, the life of a team is made of
all of the decisions that they make.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.950
So we cannot pretend this is
an easy process for teams.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.170
Things can go wrong if one person
is trying to overpower and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.550
put opinions over others.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.810
This happens all the time.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.290
This is why we have
a leader of a sprint.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.850
The leader of the sprint is
watching the entire group.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.650
They want to make sure that the
introverts and the extroverts are heard,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.450
the designers and the engineers,
the CEO and the intern.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.400
Everyone could have a great
decision at this point.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.730
&gt;&gt; So at this stage we look at the
solutions, we vote, and we make a call.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.230
&gt;&gt; That's right.
