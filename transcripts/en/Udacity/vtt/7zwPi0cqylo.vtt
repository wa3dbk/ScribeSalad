00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome back.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.830
Now you've learned the fundamental
process of prototyping.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.980
We're going to take this lesson to
talk about where to go from here.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.400
We'll talk about how to continue
to iterate on your prototype

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.560
using the same tools, or new ones.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.815
We'll also talk about how
to bring in designers and

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:19.205
engineers either as a sole
entrepreneur or as part of a company.

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:22.645
And finally we'll talk about how to
present your prototype and talk about it

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:25.205
to potential shareholders either
within your company or outside it.
