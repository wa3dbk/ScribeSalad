00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.220
In the previous lesson, we discussed agile

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.689
software development. Its principles and practices. And two

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.060
specific agile processes. XP and Scrub. In

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.230
this lesson, we will introduce a practice that

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.020
is of fundamental importance in the context

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.120
of agile software development. Software refactoring. Software refactoring

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.030
is the process of taking a program and

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.040
transforming it to make it better. That is,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.240
to make it easier to understand, make it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.880
more maintainable, and in general to improve its

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.300
design. Specifically, we will discuss what the refactoring

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.680
is and why it is important? When to perform

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.980
refactoring, and when not to perform refactoring? And

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.520
how to perform refactoring in a fully automated way,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.293
using tools. We will also introduce the concept

00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:50.040
of bad smells, where a bad smell, in software,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.323
is the indication that there might be something wrong with

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:56.890
the code that might call for the application of refactoring.
