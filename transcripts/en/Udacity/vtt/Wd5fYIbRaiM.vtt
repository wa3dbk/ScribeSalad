00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.770
These numbers are great but I think it would help if we looked a little bit

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.316
more closely at how we just calculated each of these answers. Let's just focus

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:12.885
in on this first here for a second. For the first year, what we found was

00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:18.555
$10,000, the amount we started out with, plus 0.03, the interest rate times

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:26.895
that original amount of money, $10,000. Now, to help us understand in a

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:31.055
different way what's going on here, I'd like you to factor out the 10,000 from

00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:37.416
this expression and then write something in these parentheses right here. Now,

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:42.375
you don't need to sum anything inside the parentheses. You can just leave 2

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.539
terms in there.
