00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.950
So now, let's look at what loop unrolling gives us. The first benefit it gives

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.320
us, is that it reduces the overall number of instructions we have to execute.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.120
We started out with this code. And the overall number of instructions that we

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.670
execute in a thousand iterations that we had of this loop.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.290
And the number of instructions that we had to execute in this loop was five

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.280
instructions in each iteration, times 1,000 iterations of the loop. For

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.170
a total of 5,000 instructions to do this loop. Now we unroll this loop once and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.430
got this. Now the number of instructions is eight times.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.140
In each iteration of this loop we are doing the work of two iterations. And

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.620
we are moving the pointer by two places. So

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.870
we only have 500 iterations as opposed to 1,000 here.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.370
Which gives us only 4,000 instructions to do the loop, instead of 5,000. So

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.940
we have dramatically reduced the number of instructions it takes to do the loop.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.610
And we did it by eliminating what's called the looping overhead. Basically this

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.290
is the work of the iteration and this is the looping overhead to go to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.420
the next iteration. When we do two iterations at time we do twice the work, but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.300
the overhead only applies to one of the new iterations. So

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.950
we get half the overhead per original iteration.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.370
Remember the iron law where the execution time. Is the number of

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.310
instructions times the CPI times the cycle time of the processor.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.860
The cycle time will not change. We still have the same processor. The CPI may or

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.670
may not change but definitely we have reduced the number of instructions. So

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.870
we can see that loop unrolling just by eliminating the looping

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.670
overhead can reduce the execution time, but let's look what happens to the CPI.
