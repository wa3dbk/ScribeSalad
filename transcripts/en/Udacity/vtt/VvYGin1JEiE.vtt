00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.032
We know the lowest common denominator is helpful whenever we want to solve this

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:08.282
type of equation. So in order to solve this equation we're actually going to use

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:12.656
the LCD. We're going to multiply every term in the equation by the lowest common

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:17.722
denominator to simplify the equation. So let's start by figuring out the LCD.

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.353
What is it for this equation?
