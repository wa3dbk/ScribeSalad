You know you want 1/3 of 1/2 to be 1/6, so
somehow I need to get 1. Well, 1 * 1 is 1,

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:07.574
so I know I need to multiply the
numerators, so if you chose

00:00:07.586 --> 00:00:11.993
multiplication, great. And then for the
denominator, I need 6. Well, I know 3 * 2

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:16.042
is 6, so it must be multiplication as
well. Whenever we take a fraction of a

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:19.714
fraction, we multiply the numerators and
multiply the denominators
