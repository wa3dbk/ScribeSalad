00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And here is my answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There are a number of ways to do this, but a simple one is to take the old mean,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
multiply it by the number of observations, which gets us the sum,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
add to it the new value, which gets us the new sum,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and then divide it by the new number of observations,

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which is just one more than the old one.
