00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.570
Let's go back to the documentation for
the OnClickListener.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.680
As we're starting to realize, Android
is very specific about the details

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.110
around how to listen for an input event.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.110
The method can't be named anything else.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.130
It needs to be precisely on click and
have exactly

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.640
one input which is the view being
clicked on and have no return value.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.870
So you can think of this outline
here of the OnClickListener

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.100
regarding the class and the methods
as a contract that you as a developer

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.330
need to follow in order to be
notified of the click events.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.360
In more formal Java terms,
this is the definition of an interface.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.740
At the top of this documentation page,
in small font, it says interface.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.680
In the future, its highly
likely that you may come across

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.950
another component in Android
that is also an interface.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.780
So at this point,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.290
you may be wondering, wait a minute, how
was an interface different from a class?

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.490
The document pages look pretty similar.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.500
Well, in the last course,
we learned about classes like text view,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.830
which contains state and methods
that are fully implemented, meaning,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.420
there are instructions in each method.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.540
Now we're being introduced
interfaces which contain no state,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.110
but it does contain method signatures.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.390
Remember that a method signature
signifies the return value, method name,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.560
and input parameters.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.410
It ends with a semicolon and
there are no curly braces,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.500
with the code in the middle for
implementation of the method.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.900
This means it's an abstract method.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.060
An abstract method's implementation
is intentionally left blank so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.160
that a developer like you who
wants to use the interface

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.790
can provide their own
specific instructions for it.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880
So it's like saying,
fill in the blank for

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.140
what you want to happen when
this view is clicked on.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.010
There can be multiple abstract methods
in an interface, but this example of

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.720
the onClickListener interface only has
one abstract method, the onClick method.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.520
In the future,
we'll also encounter abstract classes.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.520
This is a partially implemented
class and it contains state and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.790
some methods are fully implemented while
other methods are left abstract for

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.770
someone else to define the behavior.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.730
So you can think of this as
a continuum where an interface is not

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.000
implemented at all, and abstract
class is partially implemented, and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.220
a concrete class is fully implemented.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.380
So how come an on click listener
is not a concrete class?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.347
And why isn't a text view an interface?

00:02:13.347 --> 00:02:16.520
And the same with the view
group being an abstract class.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.990
The Android team made these
respective decisions,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.730
based on what would make it easier for
developers, like you, to build an app.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.310
Every developer will need to
display text on the screen.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.800
So they created a concrete text
view class that accomplishes that.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.980
We can simply call methods to
change the text in the view.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.070
So in this abstract class case, we want
to standardize some behavior about

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.980
view groups being a container
of multiple child views.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.130
However, the details of
how to lay out the views

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.610
on the screen is left undefined for
the subclass to determine.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.490
In this case, when your layout and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.790
relative layout are subclasses
of the ViewGroup class,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.030
they each define their own rules for how
views should be laid out on the screen.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.820
On the other hand, the Android team
knows that many developers will probably

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.760
want to customize the click behavior.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.320
It wouldn't make sense to
provide default behavior for

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.780
what happens when a button is clicked.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.103
But the Android team did want to
standardize what the method call would

00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:10.710
be and the cost type would
be in on click listener.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.010
Then they leave the logic
inside the method for

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.690
the developer to write themselves.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.690
So to summarize,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.470
if you come across a concrete class
in Android you can use it right away.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.490
If you come across an abstract class,
you need to subclass this and

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.290
then provide your own code for
the abstract methods.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.260
If you come across an interface,
you need to provide for

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.480
all the abstract methods.
