00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.714
For the CPU code we'll actually just look at three lines of C source code

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:08.479
without worrying about details like allocating memory or initializing the array.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.349
Here's our code. The first line is setting up the loop.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.852
We're going to loop from i = 0 until i = 63,

00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:18.420
incrementing i each time we walk through the loop.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.830
What are we going to do on each iteration of the loop?

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.834
We're going to fetch the input value at array location i,

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:29.069
multiply it times itself and store it into the output array.

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.336
There's two interesting things to note about this code.

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:34.903
One, we have only one thread of execution,

00:00:34.903 --> 00:00:38.106
and that thread explicitly loops over all of its input.

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:42.484
We define thread here as one independent path of execution through the code.

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:45.270
This definition is also going to apply to our GPU code.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.418
Two, note this code has no explicit parallelism. This is serial code.

00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:54.754
There's only one thread and it loops 64 times, doing one computation per iteration.
