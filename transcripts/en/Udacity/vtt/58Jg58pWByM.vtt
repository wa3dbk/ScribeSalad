00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.360
Now, to define max-min fairness, let's first assume

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.270
that we have some allocation of rates across

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.130
flows x i. Now, we say that this

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.380
allocation is max-min fair if increasing any rate

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.460
x i implies that some other x j that is smaller than x i must be

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.700
decreased. To accommodate for the increase in x

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.620
i. So in other words, the allocation is max-min

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.030
fair if we can't make, any one of these flow rates better off, without making

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.160
some flow rate worse off, that's already worse than the flow rate xi.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.470
So the upshot results in small demands getting exactly what they asked for, and

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.670
the larger demands splitting the remaining capacity

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.730
among themselves equally. More formally, we perform this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.580
procedure as follows. We allocate resources to users

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.830
in order of increasing demand. No user receives

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.470
more than what they requested. And users that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.400
still have unsatisfied demands, split the remaining resources.
