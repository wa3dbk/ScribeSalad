00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.986
Let's draw a diagrams that we can better visualize what's going on. Here's mu

00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:09.684
which is 7.47 and we want to know if the new population parameter will be

00:00:09.684 --> 00:00:15.740
significantly different. We decided significantly different if it falls in the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.805
critical region. Remember that the z score here for an alpha level of .05 is

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:28.614
1.96. and negative 1.96. Where does the real population mean fall in the

00:00:28.614 --> 00:00:33.408
distribution of sample means? Remember, that the standard deviation, of this

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:37.830
distribution, is the population standard deviation divided by the square root

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:48.954
of n. So the z-score of 7.8 is 7.8 minus 7.47. Divided by 2.41, divided by the

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:55.788
square root of 30. This is about 0.75. Since 0.75 is less than this z critical

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:59.948
value, but greater than this z critical value, the true population mean does

00:00:59.948 --> 00:01:05.642
not fall within the critical region. But we don't know this, we base our

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:10.734
decision off of our sample. If we find the z score of our sample, We do the

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:15.396
same thing that we did here, but instead eight point three minus seven point

00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:22.635
four seven divided by two point four one over root 30. And this is about one

00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:27.243
point eight night. Therefore, our sample statistic also falls outside the

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:31.212
critical region Based on the results of this sample, we would fail to reject

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:37.468
the null, and in this case we made the right decision. Because this population

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:41.956
parameter also falls outside the critical region, close enough to the current

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:47.246
population mean. Since we retained the null when the null was true, then this

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:50.213
quadrant represents what happened.
