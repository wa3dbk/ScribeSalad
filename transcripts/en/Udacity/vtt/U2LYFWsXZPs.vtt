00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.320
So in the, the previous two examples we were talking about the value of

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.420
an attribute and those are usually pretty straightforward. Let's now talk about

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.415
operations. OCL provides a way to specify operations using pre and

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:17.710
post-condition constraints. These are different keywords in the language.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.460
In this case, we're going to look at requirement three, which describes some

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.670
query operations. Now by query operation, I mean an operation that is asking

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.260
about the value of an attribute, but not changing anything. So, in this case,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.010
it should be straightforward to have an operation that returns that value.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.180
So, the requirement itself says, in addition, at any particular point in time,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.760
the library may need to know or to calculate. The items a patron has

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.520
checked out, when they are due and any outstanding overdue fines. So,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.010
let's concentrate on a part about the items a patron has currently checked out.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.250
So, previously when we did our analysis, we associated this text with

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.080
an operation class patron called items currently checked out.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.460
What we need to do now is to say something about that particular operation.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.490
We need to make it stated more precisely then just saying that it exists. And

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.260
in fact, we have to say that the value computed by this operation corresponds to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.572
just those items that are checked out for that patron. Recall that we have a,

00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:29.130
an association between patron and loanable item.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.730
And that association is going to record what items are checked out.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.490
And now we're talking about the operation in patrons, so

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.380
essentially that operation is querying the association, and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.480
we want to make sure that what the operation returns is in fact,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.910
what's appropriately expressed in the association.
