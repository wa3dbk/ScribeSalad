00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.310
Now, let's discuss
Stateful Inspection Firewall.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.140
This is different from
Packet Filtering Firewall.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.592
In a Stateful Inspection Firewall,
a packet is analyzed and

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:13.230
a decision is made based on
the context of other related packets.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.130
Typically, this means the connection
this packet belongs to.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.140
Therefor we need to record and
maintain information about connections.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.920
And then decisions are made on each
packet based on the current state of

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.020
the connection and the context of
the packet within this connection.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.140
More specifically as the packet
arrives at the firewall,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.620
the firewall updates the information
about a connection accordingly and then

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.620
decides whether the packet is allowed
in the context of the connection.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.580
For example, for

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.030
inbound packet, there is part of
an established email connection.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.360
The firewall can check that the inbound
packet is a response to a previously

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.720
outbound packet.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.150
In addition, the firewall can resemble
multiple packets of the connection and

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.300
inspect the connection data such
as the exact FTP commands or

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.450
which file the FTP is transmitting.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.340
Or the firewall can actually look
into the page contents received from

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.010
a web server.
