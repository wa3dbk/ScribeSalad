00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.690
Of course, with less memory, you're going to run out

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.120
of memory more frequently. And you'll have to make sure

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.840
that your code is bulletproof in low memory conditions. But,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.090
this also means that the garbage collector is going to

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.180
run more frequently. And, running the garbage collector will actually,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.690
often, also cause a spike in battery usage. So, all

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.450
of these are true. However, the battery drain, caused by

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.740
the garbage collector, is less of a concern than stuttering and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.550
other rendering problems that the garbage

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.050
collector can cause. When the garbage collector

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.850
needs to clean up, it pauses all

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.610
JavaScript execution and rendering on your thread.
