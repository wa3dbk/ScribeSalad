Grant consults his books from the first four days of manufacturing. Everyday,

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:09.386
the total number of sest of wiper blades that have been produced up until that

00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:14.009
point is logged. So after one day, 23 wiper blade sets have been made. After two

00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:18.475
days, there are 46 total. Three days, 69. And so on and so forth. When Grant

00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:23.035
looked at this, he noticed a pattern. Let's help Grant continue the table. How

00:00:23.047 --> 00:00:26.985
many sets of wiper blades will have been produced by the end of day 5?
