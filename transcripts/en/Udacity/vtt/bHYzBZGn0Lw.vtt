00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.550
For an exponential function of the form f of x equals a to the x,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.440
we know that a must be greater than 0, and a cannot equal 1.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
Now, since logarithmic functions are the inverses of exponential functions,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.290
the same must be true for the base of a log. That means that this choice,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.350
all positive real numbers except 1, is correct. The positive real

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.500
numbers are the numbers greater than 0, and if you don't include 1,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.040
that means that they can't equal 1. Remember that if we let a equal 1 and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.380
see what happens we end up with a function f of x equals 1 to the x.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.470
This is just equal to 1, which means it's just a horizontal line.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.130
This doesn't pass the horizontal line test. So that means that

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.330
this exponential function doesn't have an inverse. In other words,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.940
if we let a equal 1, then there's no logarithmic function that can come out of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.085
this exponential function. The same is true if you decide to let a equal 0.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.350
So bottom line, they're both logs and exponents, the base of it,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.015
which I've written as a, must be positive and it can't equal 1.
