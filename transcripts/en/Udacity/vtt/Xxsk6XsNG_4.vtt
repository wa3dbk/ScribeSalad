00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.666
Now that you've practiced with ANOVA with the same sample sizes, and you've

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.378
seen the F test output using software, we're going to do one more example with

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:14.021
different sample sizes. In a study to reduce tumor sizes in breast cancer,

00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:20.310
researchers analyzed the effects of a placebo pill, and three types of drugs.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.410
After each treatment was administered, the researchers observed the reduction

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.499
of tumor diameter in centimeters. For 20 people who had tumors, first calculate

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.820
the mean of each group.
