00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.540
So let's look at the relatively
simple implementation of a barrier

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.510
in a program.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.920
So this is our barrier implementation.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.590
Our counter is a shared variable, and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.180
everybody's trying to increment it
when they arrive to the variable.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.410
Multiple threads could arrive to
the variable at about the same time.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.590
So we have to protect
the counter using a lock.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.750
So here what we are really
doing is counting the arrivals.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.050
Once we are done incrementing the
counter we can check if the counter is

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.170
equal to the total.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.590
If it is, that means that we
are either the last thread.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.630
Or the last thread has arrived.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.480
Note that the two are not
necessarily the same.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.280
We may be able to increment the counter,
but we are not the last thread.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.930
But, by the time we get to check the
total, the last thread has arrived and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.800
increments the counter.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.750
So, we read the counter that is not
the same as what we left it with.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.330
Either way,
if the counter is equal to the total.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.680
Then we reset the counter,
because it needs to be re initialized so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.050
that next time we enter the same barrier
variable we have the counted zero.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.010
And we set the release flag to one so
that

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.870
the threats who are waiting find out
that the barrier can now be released.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.280
If the count is not equal to the total,
then we're going to spin here waiting

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.270
for somebody else to find that the count
is equal to the total end release.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.680
After we are done going through
one instance of this barrier,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.720
the release will be one.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
Before we can reuse this barrier,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.100
the release needs to be set at zero and
that's the purpose of this line here.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.630
If we are the first thread to arrive,
then we're going to set release to zero.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.560
So the idea is now that as we enter the
barrier, the first thread that arrives,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.340
and know that this is done
in a critical section,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.690
so exactly one thread will see this
as zero, it sets release to zero.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.800
That thread then increments the count,
it becomes one, and goes on here.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.490
That thread, and all the other threads,
now see release as zero and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.200
the only way it becomes one is
if count reaches the total.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.340
So what happens is the first thread
might actually be delayed and

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.520
read the count after everybody's done
in which case it's going to do this.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.280
Or it might go here and spin but

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.310
either way, release becoming one means
that somebody got to this point.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.380
Which is when the barrier
should be released.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.150
One or more threads that arrive
towards the end are going to do this,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.890
which will reset the count so that
next time we enter we see count zero.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.460
And release is set to one which
ensures that those threads that didn't

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.390
end up here are going to
see release as one.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.124
Note that the meaning of this
spin,release equals one,

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:46.170
is actually that we wait for
release to be one.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.560
It turns out that this barrier
code is not entirely correct.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.250
If two threads are synchronizing on
this barrier, the total will be two.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.000
And the barrier actually
works the first time.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.960
So the thread one reaches the barrier.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.670
And so does thread two.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.530
Now they synchronize on this barrier,
and that will work.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.280
But if we try to continue work,
and then synchronize on the same

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.870
barrier variable again, we would expect
that this setting of the count to zero,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.520
and is setting of the release to zero,
to work but it doesn't always work.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.330
So this is not an entirely correct

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.290
implementation of a barrier that
can be used more than once.
