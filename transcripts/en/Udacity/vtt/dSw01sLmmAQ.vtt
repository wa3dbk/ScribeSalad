00:00:00.073 --> 00:00:02.212
So what kind of processors are we going to build?

00:00:02.212 --> 00:00:04.944
Let's assume that the major design constraint is power.

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:09.848
Why are traditional CPU-like processors not the most energy efficient processors?

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:13.129
Well, traditional CPUs have very complicated control hardware.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.089
This allows flexibility in performance, but as control hardware gets more complicated,

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.713
it's increasingly expensive in terms of power and design complexity.

00:00:20.713 --> 00:00:24.762
So if we want the most bang for the buck in terms of computation for a fixed amount of power,

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:27.565
we might instead choose to build simpler control structures

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:32.637
and instead take those transistors and devote them to supporting more computation in the data path.

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:36.711
If we want the most bang for the buck in terms of computation for a fixed amount of power,

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:38.880
we might choose to build simpler control structures

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.848
and instead devote those transistors to supporting more computation to the data path.

00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:45.554
The way that we're going to build that data path in the GPU

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:48.853
is by building a large number of parallel compute units.

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:52.720
Individually, those compute units are small, simple, and power efficient.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.723
These are the chickens.

00:00:53.723 --> 00:00:56.711
But we can put a very large number of them on a single chip,

00:00:56.726 --> 00:01:00.373
and the challenge to us in this class, and more generally in the computing industry,

00:01:00.373 --> 00:01:04.638
is to program them in such a way that they can all work together to solve complex problems.
