00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.510
You've learned so much, drawing, view
port management, movement, user input.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.770
And now it's time to build
a real game from scratch.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.330
Icicles is a game where the player
first selects a difficulty.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.420
And then can use the arrow keys or
phone accelerometer

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.190
to move their character left and
right to dodge the falling icicles.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.020
This seems pretty easy.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.300
So we can tap the screen again
to go back to the difficulty,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.220
select screen and
select a harder difficulty.

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:30.860
Wow, okay, that's a lot of icicles,
oh, oh, no.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.850
Oh, this is a lot harder.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.370
So you can start building your own games
once you're done with this course.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.644
Well, start this level using
the LBGTX project setup

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:43.344
utility to create
a totally fresh project.

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:43.930
Let's go.
