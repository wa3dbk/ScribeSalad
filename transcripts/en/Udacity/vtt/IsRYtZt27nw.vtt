00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.880
So, how did the system know that 
the Maps app could handle this intent?

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.604
The activity within the Maps app
included an intent filter,

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.910
like this one, within its manifest entry.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.730
It indicates that the Maps app
is capable of performing

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.210
this view action on all data
which has a geo scheme.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.080
You can use intent filters
for your activities to define

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.960
the actions they're capable 
of performing, and optionally,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.300
the kind of data that 
they can perform it on.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.024
So when you use 
an implicit intent to address

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:33.060
or request to start an activity, 
much like you did with Catherine

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.480
and the openweathermap.org link, 
Android resolves this request

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.430
by checking the intent filters 
of every activity that's installed

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.490
on the device until it finds 
the best possible match.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.790
If multiple activities match, 
as in the case with the web URL,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.570
the user is given a choice.
