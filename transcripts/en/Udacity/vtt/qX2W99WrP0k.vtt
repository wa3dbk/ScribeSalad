00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.170
With this new plot, we can see that the friend

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.860
counts for young users aren't nearly as high as they looked

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.870
before. The bulk of young users really have friend counts below

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.360
1000. That's why we see these really dark regions along here.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.020
Remember, alpha is set to 0.05, so it takes 20

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.200
points for a circle to appear completely dark. You also still

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.290
might have seen this peak around 69, which is what we

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.950
originally saw when we looked at friend count in our data.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.820
It's faint because we have the alpha parameter set to 0.05, but I would

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.280
say that this is comparable to users in say, the 25 or 26 age group.
