00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.130
So we took our original equation and we completed the square. We added 32 to

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.970
complete the square, which mean we needed to subtract 32 from the same side of

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.690
the equation, so that way our equation remained unchanged, or it remained

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.540
balanced. Now remember our goal is to take this equation and to write it in

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.018
vertex form. Something that we can identify. So, what I want you to do, is to

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:28.575
take this equation, and write it in vertex form here. I've already put y

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:33.237
equals, so I want you to fill in the rest. Once you've written the equation, in

00:00:33.237 --> 00:00:36.150
vertex form, type in the vertex here.
