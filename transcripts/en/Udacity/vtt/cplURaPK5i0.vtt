00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
So Alice is now super, super happy, but what about the others?

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.090
So I suggest that we take a look at Dave here,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.720
and Dave, as you remember, was working on a logistics problem,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.270
so what he was trying to solve was shortest tour.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.240
And actually, last time we left off,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.350
Dave wasn't too happy,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.420
because we found out it is not very easy to find

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.350
a good search tree or a pre processing strategy

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.080
for his problem.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.020
On the other hand, of course, we mentioned that in practice

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.220
shortest tour is usually very easy to solve,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.400
but from a theoretical perspective,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.530
maybe we were a bit lucky for Dave;

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.830
if we're not looking for the best possible solution,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.810
but except an approximation,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.650
and then if we should find an approximation,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.690
Dave can get a little happier here

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.060
and of course he doesn't have to be as jealous that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.520
Alice has such an NP complete problem

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.120
and he seems to have a harder one.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.420
Now lucky for Dave,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900
there is a constant factor approximation algorithm

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.380
for shortest tour,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.790
but since Dave is not that proficient in theoretical computer science,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.530
I think he doesn't really stand a chance

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.410
of coming up with this algorithm himself,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.580
so you will have to pay close attention now

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.560
to be able to explain it to Dave.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.210
The concept that we will use is that of a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.150
spanning tree, and if you've had an algorithm course before,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.110
you will know what a spanning tree is,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.740
but I'm quickly going to explain it to you just to make sure.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.620
A spanning tree is a part of a graph

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.260
or actually it's a selection of edges

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.500
in a graph so that the result looks

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.390
like a tree.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.800
Well, what that means is that you select edges

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.160
so that you still keep the whole graph connected,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.000
but you don't have any cycles,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.110
so a cycle would be something like this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.690
where you can leave a vertex and then come back to it

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.830
another way, so you select edges

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.380
so that the whole graph is still connected,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.530
but there can be no cycles, so

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.150
to have you figure it out, let's do a quick quiz here.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.750
This is the thing that worked 3 times.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.130
I'm going to give you 3 choices of what a spanning tree could be,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.370
and the red edges are always those that

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.610
I'm selecting here.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.230
I would like you to tell me in which of these cases

00:02:04.230 --> 99:59:59.000
the red edges from a spanning tree for the graph.
