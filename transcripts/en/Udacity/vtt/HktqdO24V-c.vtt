00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.880
So far, we have talked about the case where there was an error in

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.960
the knowledge or an error in the reasoning or in the learning. The knowledge for

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.080
example was incorrect in some way but the knowledge can also be incomplete.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.239
There can be a gap in knowledge or in reasoning or in learning. A gap in

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.380
knowledge occur when we're doing this exercise under explanation-based learning.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.580
In that particular case, the agent had build this part of the explanation, and

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.440
it also had this part of the explanation. But it could not connect these two,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.600
because there was no knowledge to connect that are object that has thick

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.120
sides and it can limit heat transfer that it would protect against heat.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.210
Once the agent detects this as a knowledge gap,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.310
then it can set up a learning goal. The learning goal now,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.430
is, acquire some knowledge that will connect these two pieces of knowledge.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.010
Once the agent detects a knowledge gap, it can set up a learning goal.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.670
The learning goal now is to be able to connect these two pieces of information.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.340
Notice that we are seeing how agents can spawn goals.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.930
In this particular case the agent is spawning a learning goal.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.170
You might recall that when we did this exercise on explanation based learning,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.480
the agent went back to its memory, and found a precedent, found a piece of

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.260
knowledge, that enabled it to connect these two parts of the explanation. And so

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.700
this link was formed and the agent was then able to complete its explanation.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.390
This is an example how the learning goal was satisfied, using some piece of

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.870
knowledge. In this case the knowledge came from the memory. But the agent could

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.720
have potentially also acquired the knowledge from the external world.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.730
For example, it may have gone to a teacher and said, I have a learning goal.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.870
Help me with the knowledge that will satisfy that learning goal.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.670
Its ability to spot learning goals and then find ways of satisfying or achieving

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.910
those learning goals or any goal in general, is another aspect of metacognition.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.750
So this was an example of how metacognition helps resolve a gap in knowledge.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.040
Now let us see how it can help resolve gaps in reasoning or

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.170
learning. To see how metacognition can help resolve reasoning gaps,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.350
let us return to this example of using mean sense analysis in

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.110
the blocks micro build. Once the agent reaches a cul de sac in the reasoning.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.508
The agent could formally list its goal and ask itself how can I help to

00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:12.320
resolve this cul-de-sac. It may then be the reminder of this strategy problem

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.330
reduction was it uses its goals into several independent goals and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.680
then the agent can go about achieving each goal at one at a time. Thus in this

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.700
example, the agent set up a new reasoning goal and that used that reasoning goal

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.900
to pick a different strategy and thereby achieved that reasoning goal.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.280
Note also that this is one way in which we can integrate multiple strategies. We

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.620
first use some [x] analysis right in the cul-de-sac, form a new listening goal,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.350
use the listening goal to bring in a different strategy follow reduction and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.410
then go back to the original strategy means and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.670
analysis. We're achieving each goal independently
