00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For homework 3.4, we also give you equations for the position of our robot.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's start at the center coordinates of our circle,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
because our robot is undergoing circular motion,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and we can look at the (x, y) coordinates of our robot before the motion.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now, the question is given these (x, y) coordinates and the robot's orientation angle theta,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
how can we find cx and cy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, we just define a right triangle, and we see that this angle is theta.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We can show this angle must also be theta.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This length is R, so that means this horizontal distance is R times the sine of theta,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the vertical distance is R times the cosine of theta.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That means that cx is just equal to the initial x position minus this extra distance,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
R times the sine of theta, and cy is equal to the initial y position plus this extra distance,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
R times the cosine of theta.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Okay. Now let's let our car advance by some turning angle beta.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This angle is beta, and here is our robot car.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Let's call these coordinates x-prime, y-prime.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
How can I get an equation for x-prime and y-prime.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Well, we can see that this total angle here is equal to beta plus theta,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and just as we defined a right triangle before, we can define another right triangle

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
where this line is going to be R times the sine of beta plus theta,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and this line will be R times the cosine of beta plus theta.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So working from our center point,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
x-prime is going to be equal to cx plus this extra distance, which is R times the sine of beta plus theta,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and the y-prime we can see will be cy minus the extra distance of R times the cosine of beta plus theta.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Theta prime, of course, will just be equal to our old theta plus the turning angle.

00:02:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We can't forget to make the mod 2π. Good work.
