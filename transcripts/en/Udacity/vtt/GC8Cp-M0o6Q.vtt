00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.480
So let's begin with the very first cycle, cycle one. In this cycle there is

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.867
nothing to dispatch and nothing to write of course. So the only thing that we

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:14.945
really need to be concerned with is issuing an instruction. The load will look

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:19.634
at the reservation stations and look at basically the load's RQ in this case.

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:23.890
And see that there is an empty space there, so we can issue. So, we will

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.920
mark that this instruction gets done in cycle one, as far as issue is concerned.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.640
Now, we have a busy load store Q entry. The operation is a load.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.070
Now, the load uses an address. It doesn't really use a value. So,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.260
in this case we will use our R2 which is 100. And add 34 to it.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.976
And that address will be computed before we put it in the load queue. So

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:52.080
let’s say that this value is noted here as 134. So this is really the address.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.628
We are not waiting for anything, but this load will produce a floating point

00:00:56.628 --> 00:01:02.500
value and put it in F6. So we need to rename F6 to point to Load 1.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.080
And the load doesn't dispatch in the same cycle because we said that we cannot

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.350
do that. So this kind of concludes the issuing of this load. Now let's look

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.258
at the second cycle. In the second cycle, we will try to issue this load and

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:21.417
there is a free unit, so we will do that. It's 45 from R3, so it's going to

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:26.070
be 245. Again, this is done by the address unit. It's not done by the ALUs or

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.920
anything. So this addition gets done immediately. And we are not waiting for

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.830
anything because a load doesn't really need to wait for

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.115
an, any floating point registers. And then,

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:40.490
F2 is where we're going to put the result. So we're going to mark this as LD2.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.700
And this is it as far as the issuing is concerned in this cycle.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.230
We will, dispatch, this load now. So its execution begins in cycle two,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.300
because everything is ready for it. And now, we need to consider, okay, so

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.750
it takes two cycles to do a load. Does the write back happen at the end of

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.110
the second cycle or does it happen in the cycle after that? In this case we

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.000
will assume that the write back happens after the execution is done.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.920
So the execution of the load will be done in cycles two and three. And the write

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.990
back will happen in cycle four. So we will kind of know, that basically we

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.141
will be able to write in cycle four here, just to kind of remember that
