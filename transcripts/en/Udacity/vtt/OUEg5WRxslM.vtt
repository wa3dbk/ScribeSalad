00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.460
So now, let's look at how do
we form the offset index and

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.480
tag in the address for
set-associative caches?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.042
This is a two way set-associative
cache that has four sets.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:17.250
When the processor produces an address,
the least significant bits

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.900
that tell us where in the block we are,
are still determined by the block size.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.570
The indexed bits are the ones that tell
us which set are we talking about.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.130
So the number of index bits is
determined by how many sets we have.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.160
In this case, we have four sets,
so we need two index bits.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.730
The remaining bits are the tag.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.620
Like in a direct mapped cache,
once we have placed the line in for

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.630
example set zero,
we know that everything that maps to set

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.980
zero will have bits zero zero here, so
we don't have to keep that in the tag.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.610
In set zero, we only need to
make sure that what we now need,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.880
matches what we have in the uppermost
bits, not in the indexed bits.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.220
Because the fact that we're looking at
set zero, means that we have already

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.920
determined that these bits are zero
zero, and everything that we could have

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.618
placed here,
also has zero zero bits in the index.

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:24.590
Interestingly, a direct-mapped
cache of the same size

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.850
will have one more index bit, so
it would have slightly smaller tag.
