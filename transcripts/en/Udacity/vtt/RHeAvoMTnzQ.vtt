00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.936
And we're going to do a strategy that we've done before. Let's look at a simpler

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:09.803
version of the problem. A pair of shoes costs $60 and is on sale for 20% off.

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:14.864
What will you pay for the shoes? The key thing is that we do not pay 100% of the

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:19.289
price. If we did pay 100% of the price, our math would look like this. We'd have

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:19.341
$60 times 100%.

00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:28.005
I know percent means out of 100. So, I have 60 times 100 over 100. Well, I know

00:00:28.017 --> 00:00:34.350
100 of our 100 is just 1, so I have 60 times 1. I could have just gotten that by

00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:40.475
moving my decimal two places to the left. We know dividing by 100 is the same

00:00:40.487 --> 00:00:47.149
thing as moving the decimal two places left. So, I would owe $60. Notice, if you

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:52.420
have 100% of something, the value doesn't change. My price originally was $60,

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:55.384
and if I pay 100%, I still pay $60.
