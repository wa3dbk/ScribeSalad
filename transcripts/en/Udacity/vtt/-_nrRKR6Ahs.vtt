00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.780
Here's your first project. Go out and find a

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.110
signifier that's confusing to you or others. Document that with

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.380
photographs, like you just learned. So here's your challenge.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.630
How are you going to fix it? How would you make

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.310
it better? How could it be less confusing? Take

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.260
materials that you find anywhere, and improve upon it, so

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.870
it's not confusing. Then, submit all that, and later I'll

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.970
show you a solution for a signifier that I found

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.850
confusing, and how I decide to fix it.
