00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through a possible answer together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We initialize our chart to be the empty mapping,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and I'm going to define a procedure named memofibo.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If we're asked to compute the Nth Fibonacci number, and it's already in the chart,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
then we don't do any more work. We are super lazy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We just look it up in the chart and return that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Otherwise, we need to both set the chart and return the new value.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So if n &lt; or = to 2, the thing we want to write down in the chart is 1.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Otherwise, we'll figure out the value of the chart by calling ourselves recursively

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
on n - 1 and n - 2 and adding them together.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In any event, since we set the chart here or here, we'll just return the value in the chart.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now I've asked us to print out the value of memofibo 24,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and we get the answer that we're expecting.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
However, the real proof is in the timing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Using our timing code once again, I've now put in the code for memofibo instead,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and we're trying to compute memofibo of 25.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
How long does it take to do this 100 times?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Oh! Significantly less time!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Remember before it was almost 3 seconds--almost half of our page budget.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now you can barely detect it--not a tenth of a second, not a hundredth of a second,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but even smaller. This was a phenominal cosmic optimization.

00:01:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We are so much faster. It is not even funny.
