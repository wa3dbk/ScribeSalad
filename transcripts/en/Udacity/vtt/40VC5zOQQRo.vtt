Alright, so not too much code. First we call a new XMLHttpRequest, then we

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.144
specify the open method with the parameters GET, weapon.json, and true since we

00:00:10.156 --> 00:00:15.241
want the call to be asynchronous and then we set the onload function to be our

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:20.459
parsing code from before and finally we kick-off the request with xhr.send.

00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:25.304
Now, if we open this in chrome's developer tools, we can see that we actually do make

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:29.950
this request for weapon.JSON, method get and it's successful status, and it

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:34.319
takes about thirteen milliseconds. And if we look at the console, we can see

00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:38.751
that we do actually print out the value of the X parameter that we were looking

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:39.368
for before.
