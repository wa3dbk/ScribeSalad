00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.420
This idea that we should prefer
heavier flows brings us to

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.740
the scaling algorithm.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.240
One idea is to find
the heaviest possible flow.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.930
We could do this by starting with
an empty graph and then adding an edge

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.300
with the largest remaining residual
capacity until there was an ST path.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.960
But this would be unnecessarily slow.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.780
Instead, we fix a schedule of thresholds
for the residual capacity, and

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.400
lower the threshold when there
are no more augmenting paths

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.010
in the residual network.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.610
We'll start by defining the residual
network with threshold delta

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.730
to include only those edges whose
capacities is at least delta.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.610
Note that when delta is equal to 1,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.720
this is the same as our traditional
definition for a residual network.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.940
We can state the algorithm as follows.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.400
We initialize the flow to 0 and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.530
the parameter delta to be the largest
capacity coming out of the source.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.480
This is a trivial upper bound on
the value of a single path flow.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.260
Then while delta's at
least 1 we look for

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.830
an augmenting path in the residual
graph with threshold delta.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.730
And we use this path
to augment the flow.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.950
Once all such paths are exhausted,
we then, cut Delta in half.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.260
And repeat.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.640
Some of the analysis,
we can do just by inspection.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.300
Letting C be the initial value for
Delta, it's clear that we only use, log

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.380
C iterations, of the outer loop, since
we're cutting Delta in half, each time.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.390
And the steps of the innermost
loop here, finding a path and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.000
using P to augment the path or
certainly order E.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.690
The big question then is how many
iterations of the inner loop are there?
