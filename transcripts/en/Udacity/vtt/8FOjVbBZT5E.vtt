Now it's your turn to code the Remove Mean Friends method in BlueJ. I'll show

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.190
you some working pseudocode, but feel free to try it yourself first, and then

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.570
come back to look at the pseudocode. We'll create a variable i, which starts at

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.435
the beginning of the friends list. Now, while i is a valid index of friends, we

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:22.350
either remove the i-th friend or increment i. We remove the ith friend if the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.880
ith friend doesn't have this person as a friend. And otherwise we increment i.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.208
Cay would like you to pay close attention to the answer to this question, even

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:34.964
if you get it right. This algorithm is going to be important again, later in

00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:35.830
the course.
