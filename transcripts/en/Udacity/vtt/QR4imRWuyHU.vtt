00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.070
So now that we have seen how to access the BTB, let's do a quiz.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.540
Let's say we have a BTB with 1,024 entries. Note that these entries

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.051
will be number 0 through 1,023. Let's say that this particular architecture uses

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:21.170
fixed-size 4-byte instructions that have to be word-aligned. Which means,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.418
an instruction needs to begin at the divisible by four address. So,

00:00:26.418 --> 00:00:29.760
an instruction can be at address 0, 4, 8, etc.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.696
But it cannot be at addresses something like 3, or 5, or 17. And

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:39.973
let's say that the program counter is a 32-bit register, meaning that this

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:46.660
particular processor uses 32-bit instruction addresses. The question for you,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.360
is which BTB entry, again, they're numbered from 0 to 1,023, should be used for

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.540
PC, whose address is x0000AB0C? Write your answer here.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.494
Again, the answer should be between 0 and 1023.
