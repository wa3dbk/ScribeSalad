00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.370
Before we go into how
virtual memory works,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.200
let's first see why do we even
want to have virtual memory?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.400
And the short answer is that we
want to have virtual memory because

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.280
the programmer and the hardware have
different views of what memory means.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.930
In the hardware view,
the machine has some memory modules

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.080
with an actual amount of memory that
can be accessed by the real processor.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.450
Let's say that this
module is 2 gigabytes and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.960
this module is 2 gigabytes.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.939
So what the hardware really has
is 4 gigabytes of memory, and

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:42.880
the address is for this 4 gigabytes
are going to be 0 through 4 gigabytes.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.744
In contrast, the programmer's view of
memory is that it's a huge array with

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:53.970
address that go from 0 to a very, very
large number if it's a 64 bit machine.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.330
This is many, many gigabytes.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.760
Obviously, this is much more than
with the machine really has.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.170
Some of this memory might
be reserved for the system.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.345
Some of this memory contains
the actual program instructions.

00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:10.225
Some of it is for static data.

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:11.295
Then we have the memory for

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:17.095
the heap, which is where malloc finds
its memory, and this heap can grow.

00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:20.800
And then some of it, usually very
high in the memory address space,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.295
is the stack.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:24.695
And that typically grows this way.

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:27.400
But the programmer doesn't
really want to be bothered

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.600
by how much space is there
between the heap and the stack.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.340
What they want to do is simply malloc,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.070
or push things on the stack, and
they never run out of memory.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.970
And in a 64 bit of rest space,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.360
chances are they won't
actually run out of memory.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.060
But the problem is the actual amount of
memory that they're using might be less,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.930
or it might be much more than the actual
memory that the machine has here.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.470
Things are actually
much more complicated

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.570
because we typically don't run
only run one program on a machine,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.670
we actually simultaneously
having multiple programs run.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.990
You might be having something
that browses files here,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.390
an MP3 player playing in the background,
and a word processor here.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.300
Each of these sees the address
space that begins at 0 and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.700
ends at the very large address.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.980
We don't want to write our programs so

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.990
that this needs to run as
the first program in the system.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.930
This needs to run as the second
program in the system.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.230
You want to write the program as if it
was the only program in the system and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.620
then just run multiple
programs like that.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.140
But that means that this
program's idea of memory is

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.780
it thinks it has all of this memory.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.840
This program similarly thinks
it has all of this memory.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.840
So as far as these two programs
are concerned, for example,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.135
their code might well be at the same
address in each program, although

00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:59.365
in fact they each have different
instructions at those addresses.

00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:04.675
So virtual memory is a way of
reconciling how the programmers view

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:08.738
memory and how the hardware actually
needs to view memory in order to work.
