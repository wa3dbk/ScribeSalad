00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the answer is the mean will double and so with the standard deviation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
To see put this again into our formula using our original mean, and now we realize

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that the new salaries x' are twice the x salaries or put differently x will be a half of x'.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If I substitute this into the formula over here, I get the same exponential expression,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but now with half x' where the x used to be.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now the trick is to deal with the half and that's more complicated than our case before.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The very first thing is I have to bring the half out of the parenthesis over here and there's a trick

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
whereby I rewrite 70,000 as a half of a 140,000 and you can see where this is going.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
With that, I can now bring the half out of the square over here, which gives me a quarter,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you have to square the half with x'-140,000)²/10,000²

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and now, all I have to do is I have to bring the quarter into the 10,000.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So quarter up here is the same as a 4 down here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, you have to bring it inside the square, so we have to take the square root

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
so it ends up to be the same as the new 2, the square of 2 into the square over here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So this transformation shows that doubling the salary doubles the µ but also doubles the σ.

00:01:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It doubles the standard deviation of those salaries--I've proven it to you.
