I want to talk about two different kinds of dividing. First off, horizontally

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.140
dividing things. You can think of design as a three-dimensional picture puzzle,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.680
where you have to cut out the pieces. At any one level of abstraction, you carve

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.020
out the pieces and fit them together. This is called horizontal decomposition
