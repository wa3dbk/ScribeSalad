00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.660
One possible explanation is simply that the

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.880
router is misconfigured. In other words, no one

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.780
actually intended for the router to advertise a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.950
false route, but because of a misconfiguration the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.390
router does so. The AS seven zero zero

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.200
seven attack that we discussed last time Was

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.160
actually the result of a configuration error. Second,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.570
a router might be compromised by an attacker.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.040
Once a router is compromised, the attacker can

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.409
reconfigure the router to, for example, advertise false

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.640
routes. Finally, unscrupulous ISPs might also decide to

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.900
advertise routes that they should not be advertising.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.610
To launch the attack An attacker might reconfigure

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.920
the router, which is typically the most common

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100
way an attacker might launch an attack. The

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.290
attacker might also tamper with software, or an attacker

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.540
could actively modify a routing message. In addition to tampering

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.170
with the configuration, the attacker might tamper with the management

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.270
software that changes the configuration. And the most common attack

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.760
is a route highjack attack or an attack on origin authentication.
