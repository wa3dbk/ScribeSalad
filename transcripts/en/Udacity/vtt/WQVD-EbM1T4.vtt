00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.478
The usual default setting for a matrix is what is called the identity matrix. It

00:00:04.478 --> 00:00:08.410
consists of zeros everywhere, except along the diagonal, which is set to ones.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.127
If you multiply any coordinate by this matrix, you get exactly the same

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:15.930
coordinate back out. The first draw of the matrix selects the first coordinate

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.560
out of the coordinate array, the second row selects the second coordinate, and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.318
so on. Try it yourself. In three.js, we create a Matrix4 by this bit of code. By

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:29.805
default, this matrix is the identity matrix. If during processing, we want to

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:34.903
reset the Matrix4 to identity, we call the identity method on the object itself.
