00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.350
As a computer scientist, you have almost
surely written a computer program that,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.420
when you run it,
just sits there spinning its wheels.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.570
You don't know whether the program
is just taking a long time, or

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.220
you have made some mistake in the code
and the program is in an infinite loop.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.700
You might have wondered why
nobody put a check in a compiler.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.830
That would test the code to see
whether it would stop or loop forever.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.760
The compiler doesn't have such
a check because it can't be done.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.720
It's not that the programmer's
not smart enough or

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.410
the computer's not fast enough.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.060
It is simply impossible to
check arbitrary computer code

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.300
to determine whether or
not it will halt.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.530
The best it can do is simulate
the program to know when it halts.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.130
But if it doesn't halt, you can never
be sure if it will halt in the future.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.440
In this lesson, we'll prove
this amazing fact, and beyond.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.770
Not only can you not tell
whether a computer halts, but

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.710
you can't determine virtually anything
about the output of a computer.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.940
We build up to those results,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.550
starting with a tool we've seen from
our first lecture, diagonalization.
