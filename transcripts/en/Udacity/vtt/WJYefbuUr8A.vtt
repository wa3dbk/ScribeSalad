00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is, the only reasonable choice is the third one.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The reason for that is, either of the first 2 make it very easy for Alice to cheat.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For the first choice, we're only looking at the first bit out of the encryption,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so if she tries a few different keys, she is likely to find ones that produce outputs

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that differ in the first bit. Very easy to find one with this property.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For the second one, it's not easy to find exactly this property.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Finding this equality would be just as hard as it is with the third property,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but the problem is Bob does not know the 127 bits that are added.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So Bob is only looking at the first character here

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and finding 2 keys that have this property would be very easy.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So in this case, the only 1 that makes sense is this one.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
When we're thinking about encrypting files and other things,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
this isn't quite the right answer for padding in most cases.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This solution only works when Bob knows the actual size of the input

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and agrees with Alice in advance to know that all padded bits should be 0's.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
When you don't know the size, this doesn't quite work because if the message ends

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
with 0 bits, and we start the padding with 0 bits, we don't know where the actual end was.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So the usual solution to this, and there are several possible solutions,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is to start the padding with a 1 bit and then all 0's to the end of the message.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That means if the message actually ended here, if this was the end of the block,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
if the message was an even number of blocks,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we'd need an extra block of just padding to indicate that we got to the end.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In this case, since Alice and Bob both know that there's only 1 bit for the coin toss,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
as long as they agree in advance that the padding will be all 0 bits,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that would be okay.
