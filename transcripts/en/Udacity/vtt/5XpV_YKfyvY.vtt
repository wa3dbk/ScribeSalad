Now that we've looked at factoring perfect square trinomials, let's look at the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.060
difference of squares. If ever I have the difference of 2 squares, I can factor

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.782
it as a plus b, times a minus b. This factoring pattern is really helpful, and

00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:17.763
we'll see it throughout the course. So let's focus on this difference of squares

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:23.767
and see if you can factor a couple examples. Try factoring 49x squared times 4.

00:00:23.768 --> 00:00:26.263
What do you think are the two factors we need?
