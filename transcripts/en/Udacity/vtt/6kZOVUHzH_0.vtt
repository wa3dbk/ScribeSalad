00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.511
We talked about earthquakes earlier on in the course. And now we are going to

00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:07.691
talk about that something that's measured in a very similar way. Surprisingly

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:13.219
this is sound. Sound is also measured on a logarithmic scale. And we can use

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.507
this equation to help us out. This says L1 equals 10 times log base 10 of P

00:00:18.507 --> 00:00:25.494
over B. Now here, B is some reference volume. it's just a constant that we're

00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:28.134
going to eliminate eventually, so we don't need to worry about what it's

00:00:28.134 --> 00:00:34.276
actually equal to. The two variables we have are important, though. P is what

00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:38.288
is known as the power of the sound, and L here, or I'm calling it L1 in this

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:45.282
case, is a measure of the sound level. This is basically comparing the sound

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:49.485
power P to B. Now, you may have heard about different sounds being dangerous to

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:55.138
our hearing. And this equation can actually help us quantify that. L here, is

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:59.660
measured in decibels or dB. And looking at the decibels ratings of different

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.080
sounds it seems like a pretty small increase in the number of decibels.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.810
Actually amounts to a pretty big increase in potential damage. So why is this?

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.719
Well, let's look at a few other questions to figure this out. So if the

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.605
original sound power that we're talking about is p, as written in this

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:21.625
equation, what will we need to use in its place if we wanted to talk about a

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:25.756
sound with double that power
