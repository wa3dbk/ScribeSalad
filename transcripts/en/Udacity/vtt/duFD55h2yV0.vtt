00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.634
Here's another challenging problem that uses the Pythagorean theorem. This time

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:09.123
we'll have a ladder that 17 feet long, that leans against a building. The

00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:12.336
distance from the bottom of the ladder to the building is 7 feet less than the

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:17.002
distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. What you need to find is the

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.106
distance from the top of the ladder to the base of the building. Now, we'll

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:25.440
walk through this problem just like one before. First, I want you to tell me

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.200
what are the expressions for each of these sides? Try to label the parts of the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.100
diagram that you know, and then when you think that you have numbers or

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.940
expressions for each of these. Enter them in the corresponding box. If you use

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.710
a variable, make sure that you use the variable x. Good luck here.
