00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.160
Let's see the solution for the performance comparison quiz. We had a laptop

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.224
that takes four hours to compress this video. This is a latency, so the speed up

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:15.900
of new versus old will be the old latency divided by the new latency.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.964
Four hours is 240 minutes. The new latency is 10 minutes,

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:25.650
so the speedup is 24. So the correct answer

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.160
here is 24. Intuitively, a speed of larger

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.159
than one means that the new thing is actually

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.866
faster than the old thing. Speedups less than

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.440
one mean that the new thing is actually slower.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.430
So if you divide the wrong things here,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.060
if you took, for example, 10 over 240, you

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.650
would have gotten something like 0.04. And at that

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.700
point, you can check the new thing is actually

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.890
significantly faster. So if you're getting a number that is much

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.590
lower than one, that probably means you're dividing the numbers wrongly.
