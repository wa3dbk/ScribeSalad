00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
And of course, the only thing you shouldn't do is give up. Everything else--yes.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.770
Carefully check your proof. Have somebody else check your proof.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.970
Maybe the NP completeness isn't there, and if your proof is correct, think about

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.050
modifying your problem--maybe it becomes easier on that case.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.590
And finally, look forward to the next units where we will discuss

00:00:19.590 --> 99:59:59.000
countermeasures against NP completeness.
