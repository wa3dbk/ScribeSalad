In the long term this whole transparency mess may become a thing of the past as

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.960
architectures evolve. For example, ray tracing is an algorithm that solves

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.446
transparency issues directly. Be ware that currently transparency is not a

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:16.866
solved problem than most GPUs, and are simple solutions and have some serious

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:22.893
side effects. In the meantime, mellow out and enjoy the jellyfish.
