00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.740
So now that we know what locality is,

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.180
let's see how do we use it
to improve data accesses.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.570
First, we will look at an example

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.540
that considers borrowing
books from the library.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.365
In this example, the library represents
a data repository that is large.

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:19.060
So a lot of data there.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.230
But, it is very slow to access.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.850
We need to go there,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.780
find the book in the building, check
it out, bring it back home, and so on.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.400
When we're borrowing
books from the library,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.830
typically there is a lot
of temporal locality to it.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.810
For example, if we are a student, we
might need to look up the definition of

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.260
locality very often,
while we're studying.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.100
And usually also, there is a lot of
spatial locality to using books.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.220
For example, if we look up some
computer architecture definition once,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.080
we are likely to be looking up other
computer architecture stuff too,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.390
in the near future.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.040
So continuing our library based
locality and data access example,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.070
we have seen that the library's large
but very slow to access and that

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.900
accesses to information in the library
have temporal and spatial locality.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.190
So when a student needs a piece
of information from the library,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.010
what should he do?

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.340
Should he go to the library,
find the information, read it and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.970
then just go back home?

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.590
Should he borrow the book,
take it home so

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.250
that future accesses to the information
in the book are much faster?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.170
Or should he take all the books and
then build a library at home?

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.280
Let's consider each of
these three options.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.640
If we go to the library every
time we need something,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.380
we're wasting a lot of time.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.160
Finding the books, and then looking
up only one piece of information, and

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.060
then returning the book because we
know that there is both temporal and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.740
spatial locality, which means we will
be probably reading the same book, and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.600
nearby books, very often.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.820
So, the problem with this approach is
that it does not benefit from locality,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.126
and this is why typically, people do not
use it when they need to study a topic,

00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:59.410
and use library resources.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.470
If we go the library and
borrow the book, we bring it home, and

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.210
now we have the book on the topic that
we're currently working on close to us.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.680
So this is an approach that does exploit
temporal and spatial locality and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.000
eliminates the problem of the library
being large and slow because we have

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.820
very few books borrowed at home so we
can quickly find what we need in them.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.380
This is why most people
will use this option.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.772
The approach of taking all the books and
building a library at home is very

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:32.470
expensive and
also provides very little benefit.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.720
Yes, it saves us the trip to the library
and back, but it doesn't save us

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.370
the time of searching among many books,
finding them on the shelves, and so on.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.550
So really, we'd rather have relatively
few books that we're currently

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.490
interested in, than have many book and
have to look them up very slowly.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.880
So just like people when faced with
these choices about the library

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.300
usually choose the second option
because it's a good trade off

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.580
between being able to find information
quickly and not being overwhelmed with

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.200
a quantity of information that we have
brought in, when we have a processor

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.050
that needs to access main memory
we will use the same approach.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.810
Instead of going to memory for
every single memory location,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.750
we will bring the content of memory
locations that we are interested in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.290
closer to us, but we will try
not to bring too much close to

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.690
us because that will result in
a very slow structure close to us.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.650
So, we will, again, have slow accesses.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.540
So what you want is something small that
keeps only the information we are really

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.120
interested in, and that small repository
of information is called a cache,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.820
when we're talking
about memory accesses.
