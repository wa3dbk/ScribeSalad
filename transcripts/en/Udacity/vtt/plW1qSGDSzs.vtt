00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.320
Android 4.2 introduced need of support
for right to left layout mirroring.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.550
There are two simple changes
that you will need to make.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.660
In the Android manifest file,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.920
add android:supportsRtl="true"
To the application element.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.984
Then, in each of your app's layouts,
change all of the left/right layout

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:21.920
properties to the new
start end equivalents.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.090
Note that if you're targeting SDK 17 or

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.770
higher you can replace each left/right
property with a start/end equivalent.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.850
But, if you're supporting
an earlier SDK version

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.010
you'll need to use both versions.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.828
For example,
you'd use both android:paddingLeft, and

00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:38.490
android:paddingStart in each layout.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.120
There are also a few new attributes
that let you have precise

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.750
control over LTR and RTL layouts, such
as text alignment and layout direction.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.740
So check the documentation for
more information.
