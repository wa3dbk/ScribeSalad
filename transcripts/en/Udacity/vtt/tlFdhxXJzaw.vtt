00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the first homework question, we have to determine which of the given functions

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
scale linearly with the input list p.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's go through the functions 1 by 1.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This should look familiar.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
All sum_list does is take an input list p and calculate the sum of the numbers in p.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In this case the worst and the best case are really the same,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because no matter what, you traverse this for loop for the length of p.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And accordingly, if you double the number of items in p,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you also double the run time because you have to go through twice as many items

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in this for loop.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And so the run time of sum_list scales linearly with the number of items in the list p.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This procedure determines whether or not a given list p has duplicate elements.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's go through a quick example.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Here's a small list with the elements 0, 1, and 1.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Going through the code here, we have i and we have j.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In the first iteration of the loops, i and j are both going to be 0.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That means we're looking at whether the first element is equivalent to the first element.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We have this case right here that says not to compare the same element with itself.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So j increments and now we're comparing the first element with the second element

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and they're not the same.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We do that again, the first element with the third element. They're not the same.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We then increment i and reset j.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
0 and 1 are not the same,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
1 and 1 are not the same,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and lastly, we have 1 and then 2, and in this case the second element

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and the third element are the same, so we're going to return True.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
That's how this works.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, in order to examine the run time, the key part here are these 2 for loops.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
For this for loop we're going to go roughly the length of p,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and for every element in p we're also going to go roughly the length of p.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This creates a quadratic run time in relation to the number of elements in p,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
namely if we double the number of elements in p,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we're going to increase the run time of the entire procedure by a factor of 4.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Here we have our mystery function.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You've never seen this before, but the general structure should be familiar.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Here we have a while loop,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and we set i to 0 and we're going to continue this while loop

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
until i is greater than or equal to the length of p.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And looking down here, we're basically going to be iterating through p,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but we're going to do it a little different than normal.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
If the element in p at index i is even,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
we're going to increment i by 2.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Otherwise we're going to increment it by 1.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So the worst case for this function in terms of run time

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is if every element in p is odd,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
meaning we only increment i by 1 for each iteration.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So we're going to go at half the speed that we would

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
if every element in p was even.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Simplifying the worst case, all we have is a while loop through every element in the list p,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
so this is clearly linear in the worst case.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'll also note that in the best case the run time of the mystery function is also linear.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That may be a little confusing at first because it goes twice as fast,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
but we're really concentrating on the growth of the run time

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
so that even if it is going twice as fast as the worst case,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
if we double the number of elements in the list p,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the run time is also going to double.
