00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.365
For the first solution, we'll have negative 18 plus 24i. And for the second

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:11.260
solution, we'll have 28 plus 16i. Nice work, if you got those two correct. We

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.506
start by distributing the 6i to 4 and 3i. Next, we multiply to get 24i, and 18i

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:24.546
squared. We replace i squared with its value of negative 1. So, essentially 18i

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:29.314
squared becomes negative 18. Now we just flip the order of the real part and

00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:34.724
the imaginary part to get negative 18 plus 24i. In the second problem, we

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:39.674
distribute positive 6 to 2 and to 4i. In the second distribution, we want to be

00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:45.300
careful. We have negative 4i times 2 here, and negative 4i times positive 4i

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.370
here. We perform multiplication on each of our four terms to get 12 plus 24i

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.571
minus 8i minus 16i squared. We combine our like terms of positive 24i and

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:04.991
negative 8i to get positive 16i. Next, we want to replace this i squared with a

00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:10.965
value of negative 1. So negative 16i squared becomes positive 16. Remember,

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:14.320
whenever we have an i squared term, the sign just changes, and we no longer

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.181
have the variable of i squared. This was also true over here. We had positive

00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:24.372
18i squared, which turned into negative 18. Finally, we add our like terms of

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:29.772
12 and 16 to get 28 plus 16i, the final result. Nice work if you got at least

00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:31.323
one of those correct.
