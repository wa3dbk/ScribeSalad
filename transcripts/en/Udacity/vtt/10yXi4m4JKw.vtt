00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the Handshake Protocol

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
That needs to use asymmetric cryptography to do authentication.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If we want to do authentication without starting from a shared key--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which, if we’re talking about a web browser and a client, we don’t have--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that always require some kind of asymmetric cryptography.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That’s what the Handshake Protocol uses.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It uses a combination of asymmetric and symmetric crypto.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The record protocol only uses symmetric encryption.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The reason for that is that we’ve established a session key by the end of the handshake.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now we can use symmetric encryption which is much faster for encrypting all the content of pages.
