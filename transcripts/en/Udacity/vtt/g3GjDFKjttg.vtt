00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] Wow was that actually it for HTML?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Actually, yes, remember we only have 3 types of HTML elements.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The word element, which we just shot how to handle.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We call graphics.word; the tag element, which we also saw how to handle.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We check to make sure the tags match.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We call graphics begin tag and graphics end tag, and the Java script element.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now, this is super tough, but it's not really HTML proper.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here's what we're going to do: step 1, we'll interpret the Java script until we get a string.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Step 2, we'll just call graphics.word on that string.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Whatever they want us to print out, we will.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, we just need to know how to interpret Java script,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then we'll be done with our web browser.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
However, Java script is symantically richer than HTML,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which means it will be harder to interpret.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
For example, Java script has arithmetic and HTML rarely has arithmetic.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Java script also has variables.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
HTML rarely has variables, and we're going to have to deal with all of these things,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but we have to start somewhere so let's just start with arithmetic.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Suppose our input is 12 + 34.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We'll be given a parse tree that looks mostly like this,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but with some extra decorations.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Remember that our parse tree is actually more--it will look more like this for the leaves.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
They're all tuples, but I'm abstracting away the tuples stuff just to show you the shape of it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What we're going to do is just write a procedure, again, called interpret or Java script interpret,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that walks down the tree and computes values and returns them back up.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
How do I figure out what this plus means?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Well, I'm going to call myself recursively.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
How do I figure out what this times means?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Well, it's a binary operator so I'm going to figure out my left child.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's 1, and figure out my right child that's 2, so 1*2 is 2.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll just bring that up, pass that up to my parent.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, I'll call myself recursively over here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
How do I figure out this times?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Well, this is a 3, and that's a 4, so together they make 12, so this whole thing is 14.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Our order was down this way, down that way, back up, down this way, all the way back up,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and that's how we're going to figure out Java script arithmetic.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Interpreting complicated languages in computer science is often called evaluation,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which is abbreviated to eval in many instances.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We're going to write an eval procedure for arithmetic expressions like this.

00:02:23.000 --> 99:59:59.999
It will therefore be called evaluate expression.
