00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's my solution for the second problem where we have multiple %s's,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and if you recall from the lesson, the way we include that is we just include them

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in a tuple or a list.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So let's give this version a test.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Okay, we run this, and it prints, I think running and jumping are perfectly normal things.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, while we're on this editor, let me show you some common mistakes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One thing you might do is you only include 1 variable,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so I got rid of the s2 there.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's try running our function now.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We get this big exception.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There are not enough arguments for format string, which basically means

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
our format string--this t2 string--has 2 %s's in it, and we only included 1.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So if you see that a lot, or if you see that, that means make sure you have

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
all of your parameters.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's move on to an even more complex version.
