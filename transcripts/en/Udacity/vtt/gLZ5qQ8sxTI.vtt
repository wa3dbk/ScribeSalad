00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.654
The data in A fall along a straight line. Since that's in the positive

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:09.386
direction, the correlation coefficient is positive one. The data in B follow

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:14.449
along a straight downward sloping line. So the correlation coefficient is

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:19.730
negative one. For C, we know it has a weaker correlation and it's negative,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.636
which has to be negative 0.73. For D, the data don't have a strong trend in one

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:30.805
direction or another. They have a slightly positive trend, but not enough to

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:36.420
convince us that the two variables are related. This low correlation is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.666
probably 0.14. Finally E look like it has a pretty strong positive correlation,

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:46.095
which is 0.93. Good job.
