00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.890
Today we will discuss two other very general AR methods of

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.665
problem solving called means end analysis and problem reduction.

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:14.340
Like [INAUDIBLE] these two methods, means analysis and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.370
problem reduction, are really useful for very well-formed problems.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.760
Not all problems are well-formed. But some problems are. And then these methods

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.060
are very useful. These three methods, generate and test, means-ends analysis,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.130
form reduction, together with semantic networks as a knowledge representation,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.240
form the basic unit of all fundamental topics in this course.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.240
We'll begin with the notion of state spaces. Then talk about means-end analysis.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.140
Then we'll illustrate means-end analysis as a matter for

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.870
solving problems and then we'll move onto the method of problem reduction.
