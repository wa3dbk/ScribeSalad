00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.090
Before moving on from this question of
evaluation, I want to take another look

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.920
at the connections between
the various subproblems.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.750
This network is called a butterfly
network because the connections over

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.860
here on the left look
a little like a butterfly.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.570
Also note that there is
a unique shortest path

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.030
between all nodes on the right and
those on the left.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.870
Another thing to note is that
this sequence of evens and

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.500
odds on the subscripts of these
polynomials can be translated to binary

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.910
with e's being translated to 0s,
and o's being translated to 1s.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.698
And these numbers, then,

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:40.296
tell us which coefficient of
the original polynomial to return here.

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:45.414
And this makes sense, because when
we chose the even coefficients,

00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:49.750
we were choosing those that
had 0 in the lowest order bit.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.510
And when we chose the odd
coefficients here,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.410
we were choosing those with
1 in the lowest order bit.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.130
It will also be instructive
to write out the power

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.800
applied to omega here
on the right-hand side.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.570
It turns out that these numbers on
the left act as instructions for

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.710
any path to this node from the right.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.780
And these numbers on the right
act as instructions for

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.770
how to get there from
any node on the left.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.165
Let's go right to left first.

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:23.280
Reading this bit sequence on the right,
we find that 0 tells

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.918
us to go the even route first, that is,
the higher of these paths everywhere.

00:01:27.918 --> 00:01:34.350
Then the 1 tells us to go to
the lower route, towards the odds.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.140
And then the last 1, again, tells us
to go the lower route towards the odds.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.390
And indeed,
that provides instructions for

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.300
going from all of these nodes
over here to this one over here.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.270
The reverse is analogous.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.720
We think about the least significant bit
first, so to get to 6, going from here

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.690
to here, we go to the omega that has
the lower of the possible powers.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.950
And then in the next step, we go
towards the one that has the higher

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.600
of the possible powers of
omega in all these cases.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.510
And the same thing in the last step.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.790
Again, going towards
the higher power of omega,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.130
which is the downward of these paths.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.090
This network is well worth some study.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.500
It serves as an important example in
graph theory, and the topology here

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.390
has been used on some massively parallel
computers for their memory architecture.
