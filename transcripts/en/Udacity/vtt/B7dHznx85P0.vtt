00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.250
So the answer here is, there are already 120 possibilities to visit 5 houses.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.250
The way you calculate this is there are 5 possibilities for the first house,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.420
times 4 possibilities for the second house,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.230
times 3 for the third one, times 2, times 1.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.420
So it's the same as a factorial of 5,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.720
if you are familiar with that terminology, which is 120.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.960
For the second one, the number in different ways of which you can visit 10 houses,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.440
it's a factorial of 10, which is precisely 3,628,800.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.780
As you can see this number here grows enormously.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.870
Just to give you one more example.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:53.340
If we were to visit 15 houses, then the number of possibilities would be 1,307,674,368,000,

00:00:53.340 --> 99:59:59.000
which, as I'm sure you'll agree, is quite a lot. Even for a computer to handle.
