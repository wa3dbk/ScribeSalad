00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.892
To code this in BlueJ, I'll first imagine just calculating a total for one

00:00:03.892 --> 00:00:08.392
topic. Let's say it's topic two. Now for each student, I want to look at the

00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:13.160
grade for that student for the current topic. And add it onto the sum so far.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.333
This'll be the sum for this one topic. I'll initialize sum for topic with zero

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.993
and then once I've calculated it I want to store it in the correct spot for

00:00:20.993 --> 00:00:25.925
it's topic. I'll need to make this array for all of the totals, it contains

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:29.915
doubles. And it should have one for each topic, and then at the end, I'll

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:35.820
return all of the totals. But now I need to do this part for all of the topics.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.010
So, starting from initializing the sum, to saving it, I want to indent

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.475
everything, and then add a for loop that goes through all of the topics so now

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.885
that I am controlling the topic that I am looking at with a for loop we can get

00:00:45.885 --> 00:00:49.075
rid of that and now I am ready to try it, since there are less topics than

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:52.540
students it's easier to tell this time that it is right, but there are a lot of

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.005
other ways that we could do this, for example I could create my array with one

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.470
spot for each topic and I then I could go through each student one student at a

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:10.154
time, and add their total. And add their grade to the correct total for the

00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:19.713
correct topics. And then, for the last line, plus 4 plus 6 plus 5. That might

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.990
work, too. I think that's a little more confusing to read. But there could be

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.180
advantages to that way as well. I think the way that I showed was the simplest.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.706
But trying a few different ways is good practice. You could find the one that

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:32.940
you like best. What do you like about it?
