00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.430
Let's refactor that Saga code from earlier, and

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.780
run a new version in our simulated interpreter.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.200
So here's a crazy idea.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.790
What if we could somehow keep a reference to each of

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.540
the Saga functions that we create during the invocation of new Saga?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.200
And we could keep them around forever, such that they were

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.340
available long after those new Saga calls had completed and returned.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.370
So which of these techniques do you think we could use to retain access to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.480
the Saga functions even after the new saga calls the created then had returned?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.960
Would it work to pass saga to setTimeout or

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.590
return saga from the new saga function or save saga into some global variable?
