00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.937
Looking back at our original equation, the two values of x that make the

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:09.688
denominator of our function equal to 0, are 0 and negative 50 over 11. Just as

00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:13.598
we found earlier on. since the domain is all real numbers execpt for those

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:18.220
values, the range is just all the real numbers. There's nothing that T can't

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.849
equal.
