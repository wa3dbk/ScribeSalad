00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For a the answer is 0 and 0.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A can only ever be 0.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
To see this, recall that a is equal to y-bar - b x-bar,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but for a standard score, zₓ always has a mean of 0 and zᵧ has a mean of 0,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because we subtracted out their means.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
A must always be 0.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
B must always be between -1 and 1.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:43.000
To see this, recall that--as you just discovered--b is equal to r times

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
times the standard deviation of y over the standard deviation of x.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Since these are each 1, their ratio is 1,

00:00:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so b must have the same range as r from -1 to 1.
