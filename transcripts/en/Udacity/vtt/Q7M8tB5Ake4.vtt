00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.100
The simplest way that a LAN can be connected

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.600
is with something called a hub. Hubs are the

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.250
simplest form of interconnection and in some sense they

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.240
don't even exist in networks anymore today, because you can

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.450
build a switch for essentially the same price. But

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.850
for the sake of example, let's just take a

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.310
look at how a LAN would be connected with

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.270
a Hub. Now, a hub essentially creates a broadcast medium.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.250
Among all of the connected hosts where all packets

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.660
on the network are seen everywhere. So if a particular

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.510
host sends a frame that's destined for some other

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.250
host on the LAN, then a hub will simply broadcast

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.730
that frame that it receives on an incoming port

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.730
out every outgoing port. So all packets are seen everywhere.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.080
There is a lot of flooding and there are

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.050
many chances for collision. The chance of collision of course,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.140
introduces additional latency in the network because collisions require

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.490
other hosts or senders to back off and not

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.310
send as soon as they see the other senders

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.420
trying to send at the same time. LANs that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.720
are connected with hubs are also vulnerable to failures

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.700
or misconfiguration. Because even one misconfigured device can cause

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.850
problems for every other device on the LAN. Suppose

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.270
that you had a misconfigured device that was sending

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.770
a lot of rogue or unwanted traffic. Well, on a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.560
network that's connected with hubs, every other host on the network

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.160
would see that unwanted traffic. So, we need a way to

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.070
improve on this broadcast medium by imposing some amount of isolation.
