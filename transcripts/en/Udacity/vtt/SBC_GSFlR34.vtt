00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.150
Now let's talk about different approaches to operating system

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.650
structuring. The first structure that I will introduce to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.500
you is what we will call as a monolithic

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.450
structure. You have the hardware at the bottom which

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.750
is managed by the operating system and hardware includes,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.330
of course, the CPU, memory, peripheral devices such as

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.820
the network and storage and so on. And there

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.500
are applications at the top. And each of these applications

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.530
is in its own hardware address space. What that means is that every application

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.800
is protected from one another because the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
hardware ensures that the address space occupied by

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.810
one application is different from the other

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.070
applications and that is the first level

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.440
of protection that you get between the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.970
applications themselves. And all the services that applications

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.230
expect from the operating system are contained in this blob and that might

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.000
include file system and network access, scheduling

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.480
these applications on the available CPU, virtual

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.390
memory management, and access to other peripheral

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.270
devices. The OS itself of course is

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.580
a program providing entry points for the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.250
applications for the services that are expected

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.040
by the applications. And code and the data structure of the operating system is

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.990
contained in its own hardware address space. What that means is that the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.730
operating system is protected from the applications

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.880
and vise versa. So even if an

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.720
application were to do anything in terms

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.680
of misbehavior, either maliciously or unintentionally because

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.880
they are in there own address spaces and the operating system is in its

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.840
own hardware address space. Malfunctioning of an

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.080
application does not affect the integrity of the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.550
operating system services. That is, when an

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.880
application needs any system service, we switch from

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.650
the hardware address space that is representing

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.169
this particular application, into the hardware address space

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.300
of the operating system. And execute the system

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.070
code that provides the service that that is

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.430
expected by the application. For example, accessing the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.050
file from the hard disk, or dynamic allocation

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.070
of more memory that an application may want,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.920
or sending a message on the network. All

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.730
of these things are done within the confines

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.250
of the address space of the operating system itself.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.400
Note that all of the services expected of the operating system,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.140
file system, memory management, CPU scheduling, network and so on, are all

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.020
contained in this one big blob. And that is the reason it's

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.180
also sometimes referred to as the monolithic structure of an operating system.
