00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.860
In lesson one, you saw a relationship between Height and Hand Length. And you

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.150
used my Hand length, 6.75 inches, to guess my height. Based on this, you

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.934
probably guessed that I'm not more than six feet, or 72 inches tall. But what

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:19.584
if the data looked like this instead? Could we make a good guess about how tall

00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:24.088
I am? Not really. What makes this data have a stronger relationship than the

00:00:24.088 --> 00:00:28.335
other one? And what's one way to measure it? First of all, we can see if

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:33.096
there's a direction to this relationship. This is probably true in personal

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:38.104
relationships, too. In statistics, the direction of a relationship refers to

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:43.364
how the y variable changes as x gets larger. In the case of Height and Hand

00:00:43.364 --> 00:00:47.380
Length, what happens as x, or Hand length, increases?
