What you just saw, was almost a recreation of the Solomon Asch study, a really

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:07.822
famous social psychology study on conformity. What they did was they showed

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:10.990
their participants a standard line, and then had them compare it to three other

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.270
lines, kind of like the one I showed you. They had them do this about 18 times.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.042
Now, this was a relatively easy task, when the independent variable wasn't

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:24.730
manipulated. People messed up less than 1% of the time. However, when the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.480
independent variable was manipulated, people messed up about 37% of the time.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.010
So, what was the independent variable. Well, it was the people that were in the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.271
room saying the response is allowed. Out of all of the people in the room there

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:42.330
was only one real participant. The rest of the people were confederates.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.398
Meaning they worked for the research team, but they appeared to be real

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:50.133
participants. After a while of answering these questions, the researchers had

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:55.290
the confederates, incorrectly answer the question, on purpose. Because they

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.140
wanted to see if hearing these five or six people answer the question

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.064
incorrectly, would actually sway the participants' response. And well, as it

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:06.370
turns out, it did. Let's go to Susan for some more details.
