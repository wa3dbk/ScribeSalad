00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.850
When you implement a method, you can make use of a special variable called this

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.266
that references this very object on which a method is called. Here's what I

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:14.516
mean. Look at this method call. It has an argument, number ten, and that

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:19.448
argument gets copied into this parameter variable. So now distance is ten, and

00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:23.829
whenever you use distance, that means ten. Now, when you look at this car, it

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.480
really has two ingredients, the number ten but also the particular car. And

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.890
every method in Java has a secret parameter called this that's not actually

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.370
declare in the method but, in any call, it references the object to the left of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.641
the dot. Now, what's the use? If you like, you can add this in front of every

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:53.824
instance variable. Let's clean it up a little. So, now it becomes very clear

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:57.667
that it's the miles driven of this car that are set to the miles driven of this

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:04.370
car plus the distance. And the distance was a parameter variable. It's optional

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.780
to use this but some people like it a lot because it makes it very clear, which

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.569
are the instance variables and which ones are local or parameter variables. A

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:20.123
bit of terminology by the way, this is sometimes called the implicit parameter

00:01:20.123 --> 00:01:25.540
because it's never declared. It's implicit in the definition of a method. And a

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.524
parameter such as this one here is called an explicit parameter. Why don't you

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:34.354
give it a try? Here in this drive method, go ahead and add this everywhere that

00:01:34.354 --> 00:01:38.222
your allowed to do so. How many times did you get to add this and did you like

00:01:38.222 --> 00:01:41.420
it better this way? No wrong answer, I'd just like to know.
