00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:05.832
So now you are able to solve such a differential equation with the help of the exponential function.

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:19.132
We can easily say now that N of T equals its initial value times E to the minus T divided by 20 seconds.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:23.399
Such an equation can, for instance, be used to model radioactive decay.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.732
N of T would be the number of atoms that have not yet decayed at time T.

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:40.632
And this derivative, the rate of change, tells you the current speed of decay, which is the current number divided by 20

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:48.699
per second. You would expect 1/20th of the current number of atoms to decay within the next second.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.066
This is not entirely true because that number, of course, is not constant during that second.

00:00:55.067 --> 00:01:02.699
And there's another caveat. This is a number, a natural number. So keep in mind that this, again, as everything,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.666
is just a model; it's not reality.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:10.699
One important thing to learn about such a process is the mean lifetime of a particle.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.232
If you look at one single particle, how long does it take, on average, for it to decay?

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:24.899
If you look at, say, a billion particles, and form the average of their lifetimes.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.000
And now we're going to figure out a way to compute the lifetime from this differential equation.
