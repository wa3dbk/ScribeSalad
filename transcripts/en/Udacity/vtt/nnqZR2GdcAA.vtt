00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.670
The story I hope to tell, by leveraging the negative space, is that as

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.650
time's gone on, what started as a small, somewhat local tournament or event,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.100
has evolved into a global phenomena, both for the countries participating and

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.250
the home countries in terms of how much visitors they're looking to attract.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.720
Notice in the early years when there may not have been such good transportation,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.980
especially across the Atlantic, the participating countries were often

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.320
somewhat local to the game and where it's being held.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.520
But as time's gone on,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.820
we can see that more countries from across the globe are participating.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.860
And the last point I'd want to draw your attention to before we leave,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.450
is that in the beginning, and still somewhat recently, Europe and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.150
South America often dominate participation in the game and dominate who hosts.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.470
Well that concludes our map, so let's go and

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.750
try to add some additional features to make it more interactive.
