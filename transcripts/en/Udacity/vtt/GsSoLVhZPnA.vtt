00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.330
To create the histogram, we'll pass friend count to x

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.100
inside of hue plot, and we'll pass pf into data.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.370
When I run the code, I can get my histogram. Looking

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.670
at the plot, we can see that the data is squished on

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.680
the left side of the graph, just like Maura's plot, and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.280
this graph extends all the way to the 5000 mark. This is

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.670
what we call long tail data. And this data can be

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.380
common for some user-level data. Most users have friend counts under 500,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.380
so we get really tall bins on the left. But there are

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.540
a few users in our dataset with really high values. The higher

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.980
values are closer to 5,000, which is the maximum

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.510
number of friends a user can have. Moore was interested

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.020
in examining the bulk of her data. And, it's the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.610
same for us. While, we may want to investigate some

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.920
observations in this tail, we really want to examine our

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.160
users with friend counts well below 1,000. All of these

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.420
people here. To do that, we'll need to learn something

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.700
else, in order to adjust our code, and our plot.
