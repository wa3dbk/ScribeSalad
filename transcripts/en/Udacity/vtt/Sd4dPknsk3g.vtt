In the web, over the last five or 10 years, we've kind of established a new type of partner

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.840
and those are traffic partners

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.710
In a traffic partner, we have long-term agreements with other companies

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.830
that deliver predictable levels of customers to our website.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.640
How do we do that?

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.260
Well, these are sometimes cross referral or swapping deals.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.000
We pay another company may be on a per-referral basis

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.850
and our partners, our traffic partners, drive traffic using text links, on-site promotions

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.700
and ads on their site and sometimes, we might even exchange email list

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060
and other data with these partners.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.190
So, if you're on the web, traffic partner is a virtual channel partner

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.620
that simply doesn't exist in the physical world.
