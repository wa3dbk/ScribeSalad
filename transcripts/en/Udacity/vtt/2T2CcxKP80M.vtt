00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.969
So one thing I want to emphasize in this part of the lecture is that

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.930
the basic element we want to be able to do analysis on most of

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.180
the time in a 3D scene is rays of light.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.950
And you want to be able to use a rays of light to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.830
be able to extract information.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.630
So here's a beautiful image of a sun that actually if you see this image,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.350
basically all of the rays of light are coming in.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.930
And we want to be able to kind of model a lot more information about how rays of

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.320
light from this light source are hitting different parts of a scene.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.760
And, of course, it's because of the phenomenon of this being hit

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.390
these tree branches being hit, and us being able to see it,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.340
that kind of gives us the more visual feel of the scene.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.730
So we've looked at previously, and

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.640
we've talked about the whole concept that basically an image is a 2D area of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.440
pixels and that's how we actually capture a 3D scene into a 2D image.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.780
But we want to remember that the fundamental primitives at least in the whole

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.270
analysis of a picture of computational photography process is rays, you want to

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.880
be able to be able to look at information that's coming and hitting the scene.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.050
And then, of course getting reflected and we want to be able to capture as

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.810
much information from the environment based on that illumination and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.620
the rays that are hitting the scene.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.520
One of the things that's important when you start thinking about rays of light

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.410
is that basically they follow a path from the source to the scene.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.860
So therefore, we can start using things like geometry of the rays of light to be

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.840
able to extract information about what the scene is like.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.880
And more importantly, what we are interested in is how we can actually use

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.770
computation, that can control all parameters of how the optics and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.750
the sensor, that is, the way the process of illumination goes,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.260
the rays of light, to go through optics, to the sensor that actually allows us

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.560
to generate those pixels, that we can do image processing on.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.860
So, one of the important things for us to remember now is that we want to be

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.040
able to use computation, to control how the illumination,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.350
which would then create the rays of light, that would be then controlled again

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.380
with the optics to create information on a sensor that would generate the pixels

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.790
that we actually will be doing processing on to be able to generate an image.
