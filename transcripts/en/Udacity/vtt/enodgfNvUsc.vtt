00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.100
You've seen how a commit is a snapshot of every file in

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.939
the repository at the time the commit was made.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.220
We can use git to view the difference between any two commits.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.330
For example the difference between these two commits,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.750
would show what code I added to add more color to the game.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.540
Being able to view the difference between any two commits is pretty convenient.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.880
But we can also temporarily change our files back to how they were at

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.420
the time of any commit.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.830
This is called a git checkout, and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.920
it's sort of like restoring a previous version.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.880
If you're coming from SVN, this is not the same thing as a SVN checkout.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.270
In git, checking out a commit means resetting all of your files to

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.700
how they were at the time that commit was made.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.970
Why would you want to check out a previous version of your code?

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.730
One reason might be,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.520
if a bug was introduced, but you're not sure which commit introduced it.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.750
You can test wether a commit has the bug by checking out that commit and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.110
running the code.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.520
To run the code in the Asteroids Repo,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.080
I'll need to open up the index.html file on a web browser.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.960
If I'm on Windows I'll first open up this file navigation GUI.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.670
Next I'll need to navigate to the directory where the Asteroids Repository is.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.250
For me that's in my home directory, so under C, users, Seabucky.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.910
And then I put it in a version control directory and

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.940
then in the Asteroids folder.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.030
Now I want to open this index.html file.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.900
So I'll right-click on it and select Open with Google Chrome.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.210
Now, sadly, this game will not work in Internet Explorer.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.070
So you'll need to use either Chrome or

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.260
Firefox to open this file, unless the process is the same.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.200
But you should navigate to the file using Finder.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.990
If you've stored your repository in your home directory and you're

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.880
having trouble finding it, just press CMD+SHIFT+H to find your home directory.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.120
For me the files are in the version control directory and

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.595
then the Asteroids directory.

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:55.060
So I'll right-click on index.html and open with Google Chrome.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.160
So you can see the game looks a little different now.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.310
The asteroids are solid and gray.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.400
And my spaceship is blue.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.110
I'll just go ahead and play for a little bit.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.870
Whoa, what just happened?

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.060
I can shoot an endless stream of bullets.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.690
This isn't how I remember Asteroids working.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.250
Okay, as fun as that was I don't think it was the intended behavior.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.050
One of the recent commits must have introduced this bug.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.140
But which one?

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.040
It's going to be hard to tell just by looking at the git log.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.000
So.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.240
Let's check out an older commit and see whether it has the bug.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.530
I'm pretty sure the code was working when I reverted the controls.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.620
So I'll start by checking out that commit to double check.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.310
I'll type git checkout.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.640
And then copy and paste the commit ID.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.230
If you're on Mac you can copy and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.430
paste the commit ID by just using Cmd+C and Cmd+V.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.290
If you're using Linux you'll need to copy and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.670
paste with Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.690
And if you're using Windows, then you'll need to enable QuickEdit mode.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.050
Which you can find instructions for how to do in the instructor's notes.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.590
And then you can copy and paste by right-clicking.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.840
So now I'll go ahead and check out this commit.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.550
Now I get this strange warning we mentioned before.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.540
You are in detached head state.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.970
Like we mentioned, head is what git calls the commit that you're currently

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.250
working on, and you've detached it here by checking out an older commit.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.140
Now here's the reason git thinks this is worth learning about.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.880
What do you think would happen if we made changes while we

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.610
had this older commit checked out?

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.780
Where would the commit fit in our history?

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.870
It gets a little complicated so git includes some instructions for

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.280
how you can deal with this.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.680
Don't worry if you don't understand these instructions yet.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.500
We'll be going over them in detail in lesson two.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.440
For now, we're not going to make any changes, we're just going to run the code,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.010
so you won't need to worry about the rest of this message.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.330
Now I'm going to run the code and see if it has a bug.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.950
Even when I hold down space, I can only shoot one bullet at a time.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.350
It looks like the bug hasn't been introduced yet.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.460
If it had we could have just checked out an even older commit and tried again.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.080
Now an interesting thing happens if I type git log while I

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.100
have this older commit checked out.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.510
Revert controls shows up as the most recent commit, and the commits from

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.110
before like Doug touching up the iPad version of the game and me adding color.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.900
Aren't showed in git log at all.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.280
Now can still get back to the most recent commit by typing git checkout,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.740
followed by its ID.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.050
But what if you don't remember the ID?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.540
For now we've put it into the instructor's notes for you, so

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.600
don't worry about it.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.320
In lesson two, you'll also learn another way to switch between commits without

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.950
knowing their IDs.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.440
Now I've narrowed down the commit that introduced the bug to one of five.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.950
Go ahead and

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.430
do the rest of the work and find the exact commit that introduced the bug.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.110
Paste the ID of the first commit with the bug into this box.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.270
If you run into any issues, check out the troubleshooting guide we've added to

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.450
the downloadable section, and see whether your problem is covered.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.200
If it's not, please ask about your problem on the forms.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.420
Since this is your first time using git to check out previous commits,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.090
this process might take a little longer than you'd like.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.820
You might even find it faster to track down the bug without using git.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.730
Or you might want to throw your computer out the window.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.790
However the time you're investing now, will keep paying off in your projects for

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.150
years to come.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.840
Eventually you'll barely be able to remember how hard using git was at first.
