00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.950
Settings activity is tied
to a list of preferences.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.270
And the location edit text preference is
a custom preference that we have added

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.680
a widget to.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.400
That widget, when clicked,
should build an intent and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.830
start the place picker activity.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.170
And when that activity returns,
it should have a place for

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.910
us, which means that we need to process
the result of the place picker called in

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.040
on activity result inside
of settings activity.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.220
And if we have a new place we need
to store that in our location

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.960
shared preference.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.250
Of course, before we can do this we have
to configure our app for the places API.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.240
We need to add another
dependency to our build.gradle.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.950
Recall how Google Play Services allows
you to specify the bundles that you care

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.850
about and ignore the others.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.620
We already have the GCM bundle but
now we need to add the location one.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.860
Then, to use the place picker, we need
to add a permission to our Android

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.920
manifest that will give us access to
location at a fine-grained detail.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.340
Now let's look at our
place picker backwards.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.590
What will we do once we have
the place picker response?

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.762
In on Activity Result and
Settings Activity, we need to parse and

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:06.070
store the address as our
new location for Sunshine.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.800
First, we should verify that this
activity result is actually intended

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.770
for us.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.780
And if it isn't, the place picker
response will pass it along to super

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.580
in order for them to handle.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.740
If it is from the place picker and
a location was chosen,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.600
then we can fetch the place
object from the place picker API.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.390
Then look at the address to use as
a human readable location string and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.990
store this in our shared preference for
location.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.610
However, if the result
code is not successful,

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.490
we're going to gracefully fail
by not doing anything at all.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.690
The most likely cause for

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.110
this is the user hitting back without
choosing a place at which point,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.430
returning to an unchange setting
screen is the correct thing to do.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.740
To launch the place picker
we need to build an intent.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.333
But we are in a view not an activity,

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.970
which means we won't be able to
call start activity for a result.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.980
So, we need to cast the context
to a specified activity.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.490
In this case,
that would be settings activity.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.150
This will allow us to make the call to
start the place picker, and by choosing

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.620
settings activity, the result of the
place picker ends up in the right place.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.480
I'm going to let you figure out how to
build the intent and launch it however.
