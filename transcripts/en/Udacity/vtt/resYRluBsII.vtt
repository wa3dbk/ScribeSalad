00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.402
Throughout the next few lessons, we'll be talking about factors and terms. We

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:08.623
want to make sure we know the meaning of each word, so let's start by focusing

00:00:08.623 --> 00:00:13.044
on the differences between their meanings. Terms are separated by addition or

00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:17.935
subtraction in an expression. So this expression has three terms, 3 xy, 4x and

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:24.206
5. Within each term there are factors. So, the factors of 3xy are 3, x, and y.

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:30.838
These are the things we multiply together to give us our term. The factors of 4x

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:36.572
are 4 and x and the factors of 5 are 5 and 1. We could also write 4 time x as 2

00:00:36.572 --> 00:00:41.992
times 2 times x. This would be the prime factors of this term. Prime numbers

00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:47.564
have only 2 distinct factors. Here's another case where we have 2 factors, 2x

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:52.794
plus 5 is 1 factor and 7 is another. Within this 2x plus 5 factor, we have 2

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:56.719
terms. Positive 2x and positive 5.
