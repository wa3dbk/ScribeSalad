00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.297
So I eluded to this earlier.

00:00:02.297 --> 00:00:05.246
My process for
finding my weaknesses was to fail.

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:08.546
And I think that's really valuable
in all aspects of business and

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:11.492
entrepreneurship, but
particularly in the early days.

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:16.548
You can do the job, you can do it well
enough and you'll know soon enough what

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:21.684
you're not good at or it may not even be
a question of what you're not good at.

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:26.201
It may be a question of what you're
best at and what should be sort of

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:30.760
delegated or handed off to
a co-founder or early employee.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.170
So yeah, I think for
me failure was the process.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.610
I think it's really
important what I did.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.160
It's kind of silly, but every Friday
at 3 PM, I had on my calendar

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.060
just sit down and just think about
what was going well and what wasn't.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.010
And I think carving out that time to
sort of introspect and think about that.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.500
If I had a process it was that.
