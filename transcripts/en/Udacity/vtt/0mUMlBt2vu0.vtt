00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
Now that you know about polynomial time reductions, imagine that we had one problem in NP

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.790
such that every other problem that is also in NP could be reduced to it.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.540
We would have vertex cover which could be reduced to that problem,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.390
we would have independent set which could be reduced to that problem, and also clique, of course.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.180
And any other problem in NP as well.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.250
No matter how complicated that problem as long as it's NP that means

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.820
a non-deterministic RAM you can solve it in polynomial time--

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.510
there exist a polynomial time reduction to this ultimate problem.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.950
And such a problem actually has a name, so if you could find a problem in NP

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.640
such that any other problem in NP is just as hard to solve or easier to solve,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.810
then that problem is called NP complete because in a way it represents all of the problems in NP

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.110
because if it's a problem that any other problem can be reduced to, an NP complete problem

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.349
is basically capable of solving or representing all other problems that are contained in NP.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:10.410
An NP complete problem is contained in NP and the important part here is

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.020
that really any other problem in NP can be reduced to it.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.440
Not just vertex cover, not just independent set, not just clique

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.460
but any problem that lies in NP can be reduced to that problem.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.890
Let's have a little quiz to familiarize yourself with the concept of NP completeness.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.920
I have three statements here about NP complete problems

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.290
and I would like you to tell me which one of these is true.

00:01:31.290 --> 99:59:59.000
There can be more than one.
