00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.050
And before I start talking about specific testing techniques, there's

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.490
something else that I want to discuss, which is Testing

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.090
Granularity Levels. So let's consider a software system, a system

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.310
made out of components that interact with one another. So the

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.000
first level that we consider in testing is called Unit

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.490
Testing, which is the testing of the individual units or modules

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.690
in isolation. The next step, is to see there are

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.340
multiple modules and their interactions. And this is called Integration Testing.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.650
So, integration testing is the testing of the interactions among

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.460
different modules. And it can be performed according to different

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.260
strategies. Depending on the order in which the modules are

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.570
integrated and on whether we integrate one module at a time

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.510
or multiple modules together, all at once. And in this

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.240
latter case, we call this kind of integration testing, the one that

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.640
integrates all the modules at once, Big Bang integration testing.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.520
And after performing integration testing, the next step is to test

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.750
the complete system as a whole. And this level of

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.190
testing is normally called, System Testing. So system testing in the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.560
testing of the complete system and it includes both functional and

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.250
non functional testing. We will discuss functional and non functional testing

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.575
in details in the next two lessons. But I just

00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:08.330
want to give you an idea of what they are intuitively. Functional

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.250
tests are the test that aim to verify the functionality provided

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.680
by the system. For example if you consider the function double

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.840
value that we saw earlier in the lesson, a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.660
functional test will try to assess that that function

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.970
is producing the right value given a specific input.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.826
Conversely, no functional test are the one that target, as

00:01:26.826 --> 00:01:30.540
surprisingly, no functional properties of the system. For example,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.060
no functional test will include performance tests, load tests,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.310
robustness tests. In general, no functional tests will try

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.410
to assess different qualities of the system, such as reliability,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.970
maintainability, usability, so basically, all the ilities that you can

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.760
think about. In addition to these three basic testing levels, there

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.830
are two more levels that I want to consider and that

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.150
I want to discuss. And they both involve the whole system.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.610
And the first one is Acceptance Testing which is the

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.320
validation of the software against the Customer requirements. So this is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.090
the testing that makes sure that the system does what the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.720
customer wants it to do. And the last type of testing

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.729
that I want to mention is Regression Testing. And regression testing

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.260
is the type of testing or retesting, that we perform every time

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.540
that we change our system. And we need to make sure

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.060
that the changes behave as intended and that the unchanged code is

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.680
not negatively affected by the modification, by these changes. In fact,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.070
what can happen when you modify the code is that parts of

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.120
the code that are related to the changes, are actually affected

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.110
by the changes, and start misbehaving. And we call those regression errors.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.080
And regression errors, are very common. For example, you're probably

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.070
familiar with the situation in which, one software update is

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.350
released, and just a few days later, another software update

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.640
is released. In many cases that happens because the first update

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.760
was containing regression errors. So the changes in the code

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.100
that broke some functionality, that resulted in failures on the user's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.940
machine and in bug reports and therefore that caused further

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.090
maintenance, further bug fixes, and a release on a new version.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.790
Something else I'd like to mention about regression testing, is that

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.535
regression testing is one of the main causes why software maintenance is

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:05.679
so expensive. And that's also why researchers have invested a great

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.481
deal of effort into refining regression

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.495
testing techniques that can make regression

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:12.599
testing more effective and more efficient. So let me leave you,

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.129
with a little piece of advice which is try to automate as

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.470
much as possible regression testing. For example use scripts, use tools, make

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.660
sure to save your harness, make sure to save your input, and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.820
outputs for the test, because you want to be able

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.680
to rerun your test, at a push of a button as

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.750
much as possible every time you change your code, to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.560
avoid the presence of regression errors in the code you release.
