00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.950
Now we have had some experience with D3 in the console.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.150
I wanted to cover some of the basic structure of a typical D3 visualization.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.400
I will be explaining an example from Mike Bostock's tutorial,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.440
on creating a basic bar chart and the fundamentals of D3.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.020
I chose this example for three reasons.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.910
The first, is the tutorial is very clear and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.300
thoroughly explains all of the fundamental concepts of D3.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.240
Once you finish the tutorial, if you decide to go through it and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.610
create this bar chart you see here.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.750
You will have been exposed to all of the concepts in D3 necessary to build

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.580
more complication visualizations, as you will encounter later in the course.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.130
The second reason I wanted to go through this code and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.510
the tutorial is that it's very easily accessible on the web, so

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.420
you can go back and review if you feel unsure about any of the concepts covered.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.290
But also it's quite ubiquitous and

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.460
very common to other people have encountered the tutorial.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.560
This makes it very easy to share what you've learned and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.220
collaborate with others.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.610
And the third reason is simply the fact that Mike Bostock is the creator if D3.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.160
And by virtue of having built the library knows all the most important concepts.
