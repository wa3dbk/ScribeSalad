00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.950
Android 5.0 Lollipop, or API 21,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.170
added new ways to better choreograph
moving between activities.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.230
Firstly, a new API let's you to run
a transition when you launch or

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.680
leave an activity.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.520
This allows you to customize how
individual views in the screen,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.820
enter or exit.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.480
We call these content transitions.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.790
Secondly, it added the ability to
create a shared element transition.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.140
This is where an element,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.520
which is present on two screens,
transitions smoothly between them.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.500
The result is visual continuity for

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.460
shared elements across
the two activities.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.550
Before we dive deeper into
these powerful new APIs,

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.630
let's take a second to talk a little
bit about backwards compatibility.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.120
So far in the course,
almost everything we've covered

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.390
has been achievable on all
relevant versions of Android.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.760
Especially with the help of Android
support libraries like AppCompat.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.380
As we've seen in this lesson,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.510
the Android animation APIs have become
more powerful with each release.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.655
This means that some of the more
advanced effects might be impossible or

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:06.770
unfeasible to achieve on older devices.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.400
A generally good approach for
implementing animations,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.220
is to use the newest APIs but to then
degrade gracefully on all the devices,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.769
swapping in simple animations for
the more complex ones.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.430
Remember, that devices are constantly
being refreshed and upgraded.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.403
So while working on the newest API's
might have a lower uptake at first,

00:01:25.403 --> 00:01:27.692
the return on investment will only grow.

00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:32.384
Okay, let's take a closer look at
the new activity transitions in 5.0.
