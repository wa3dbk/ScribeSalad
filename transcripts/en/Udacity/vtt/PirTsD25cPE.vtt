00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.249
We already know that, in general, the slope of a line is the increase in y for

00:00:05.261 --> 00:00:10.496
every increase in x. So, the change in y here is going to be d minus b, and the

00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:15.462
change in x is going to be c minus a. So that is a general answer for how to

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:18.638
find the slope of a line between any two points.
