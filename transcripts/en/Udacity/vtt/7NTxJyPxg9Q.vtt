00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
Now, if we put all of this knowledge together and just look at the problems that are in NP

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.210
then there's a lot of different possibilities for the properties of that problem.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.140
So either the problem if it's an NP could be in P or this NP complete

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.010
or it might even be something else.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.030
Now, we haven't really talked about this something else here, but they are some problems,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.170
which are believed to be somewhere in between P and NP at least if P does not equal NP, of course.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.060
One example here, for example, would be factoring two large numbers.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.770
Now, if your problem is NP complete, there are still very very many possibilities.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.140
Your problem could be fixed-parameter tractable.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.930
Your problem could have an approximation algorithm

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.970
and that approximation algorithm might either be a PTAS, a constant-factor approximation algorithm,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.390
or also something else, and again, we haven't really talked about this something else,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.460
but for example, there are some approximation algorithms where you can have a

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.250
logarithmic approximation factor and then there are randomized algorithms,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.570
Monte Carlo algorithms and Las Vegas algorithms, and there are many many other things

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.920
that we haven't touched upon so really a lot of different complexities.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.250
Now, one final thing I should mention, they are two notions here

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.580
especially if you talked to somebody who has studied theoretical computer science.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.460
They will nitpick you about the NP completeness, because NP completeness

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.080
is technically only defined for decision problems.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.330
So if you're talking about optimization problems and you want to be very correct

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.410
then you should call that problem an NP hard problem.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.110
But many people use this term interchangeably, and actually, when you are working in practice

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.680
on hard problems, it doesn't really make much of a difference at least in my opinion,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.240
but it is not the most precise way to say it so decision problems,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.330
NP complete, optimization problems, NP hard.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.550
What would happen if we were able to show that P equals NP?

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.430
Would then each single class we have shown here become P? Or would the classes separate?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.750
And what I mean by this is could be then showed that not every NP complete problem

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.230
is fixed-parameter tractable or not every NP complete problem has an approximation algorithm.

00:02:00.230 --> 99:59:59.000
And more than one of these here can be correct.
