00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.560
To address the places where our current visualization is lacking in terms of

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.950
communicating our message, one of the key things to focus on is how do

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.210
we efficiently and effectively communicate a change over time.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.170
Our static chart shows the trend over time, but

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.080
what doesn't come across as clearly are some of the nuances in the data.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.150
One way to address this might be to try visualizing our

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.670
data with finer granularity.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.800
Instead of showing the aggregate attendance for a given year, let's see how it

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.460
comes across if we visualize every individual game and its attendance.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.660
As I mentioned before, the next task at hand is removing the code in dimple.js,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.680
that deals with axis, and coding it up in D3 itself.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.150
Well, with this code here, both creates axis and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.508
changes how the x axis is formatted.

00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:59.810
We're simply going to remove all of it and build it back up in D3.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.050
In lesson one we saw how to work with D3's extend and

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.260
scale functions to convert data values into proper pixel values.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.610
The first step in figuring out how to draw our x and y axis in D3 is

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.400
to first find the extent of each of the columns which we'd like to visualize.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.830
In this case our x axis is going to represent the date column, and

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.000
our y axis is going to represent the attendance.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.671
Remember that the extent function finds the minimum and

00:01:30.671 --> 00:01:36.480
maximum for a given data based on what you return from the assessor function.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.310
In this case, as applied to our data, extent runs the function we've

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.610
passed on each element of our data, in this case the argument D.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.390
And based on what you return from this function,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.370
extent internally keeps track of the minimum and maximum values its seen.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.650
The same principle applies to our attendance.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.260
And notice that we're using the same function, d3.extent in both of these cases,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
but since the function we're actually running is slightly different,

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.940
in the first case, we're returning date,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.658
in the second case we're returning attendance.

00:02:11.658 --> 00:02:16.490
time_extent and count_extent are actually very different objects.
