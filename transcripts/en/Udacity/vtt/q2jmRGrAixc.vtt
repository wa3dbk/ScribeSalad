00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now what if I want to have--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you know--I want to have text up here--here in the Dropdown--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but I want to have a different parameter up here in the URL.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You know--that's useful when you want

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to have more descriptive text here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The way to do that is to use the Value parameter.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's look at that in the Editor.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here we are in the Editor--you can see our elements

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and elements the way we left them.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm going to add a Value parameter to this first one.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And it's value is going to equal "1"--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the number, "1"-- instead of the string, "one".

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's go ahead and make these a little bit longer.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Our first value in the Dropdown--or our first element in the Dropdown

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
now has a value equal to the numeral, "1"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and contents of the words, "the number one".

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
All right--let's see how this looks in our browser.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So now we can see our Dropdown has changed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The first element says, "the number one"

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and the other two are the same as they were before

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.849
as they were before because I didn't change those.
