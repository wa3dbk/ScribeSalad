00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.430
Today, we'll talk about generalization and learning,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.020
using the method of version spaces. The issue of generalization and learning,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.240
is closely connected to the issue of incremental concept learning In both cases,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.280
there are small sort of examples arriving one at a time. In incremental concept

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.300
learning, we made use of background knowledge, In generalization and learning,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.890
background knowledge may not be available. Similarly, in incremental concept

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.940
learning, we control the order in which the examples arrived, but in general,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.780
in generalization in learning, we may have no control over the ordering of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.690
examples. Today, we'll start by defining version spaces,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.110
we'll talk about version spaces that has an abstract technique.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.270
Then we'll go into the algorithm for executing the technique of version spaces.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.130
We'll also, towards the end, talk about an alternative method for

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.850
organizing the examples into a decision tree, or an identification tree.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.900
This method is very similar to the method of incremental discrimination tree

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.610
learning that we learned when we were talking about case based reasoning
