00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.200
Recall how for caches we divided memory into blocks,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.920
or cache lines. And this's the granularity at which

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.310
caching operates. Similarly, for a paging system we divide

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.420
up our physical address into pages, often 4k long.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.980
Pages, are the granularity at which we grant memory

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.110
to processes. The higher order bytes determine the page

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.560
number, also called the physical page frame. And the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.990
lower order bytes determine the offset into the page.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.330
Correspondingly, the virtual address space is similarly divided into

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.509
pages. Again, lower order bytes determine the offset within

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.320
a page. The higher ones determine the virtual page

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.650
number. The number of bytes in the offset always match,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.940
that's because virtual page sizes and physical page sizes

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.860
aren't necessarily the same. But, the number of bits involved

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.260
in the virtual page number need not match the

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.440
number of bits used to identify the physical frame number.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.790
That's because, as we said before, it's possible to have more virtual pages

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.180
than physical pages. Since we're mapping

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.200
page for page between virtual and physical

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.060
addresses, the offsets stay the same. We do need to translate page numbers

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.410
however. And for this, we use a data structure called the Page Table.
