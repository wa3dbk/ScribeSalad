00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.019
Now that you've seen user input, let's turn to another topic, formatted output.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.160
Let me show you why we need to know about it. Let's look at this program here.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:18.440
I want to buy 100 cans of my super premium cat food at $4.35 a can. So, my

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.370
total price is going to be the quantity times the unit price. So, I'll print

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.926
it. There's also 8% tax so, here I'm figuring up the tax, and then I'm printing

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:34.354
that. Let's see what this program does. Well, look at it. It's ugly, ugly.

00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:40.306
Here, I expected to see $435, and the tax, you never see tax like that on your

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:48.134
store receipt. It would say $34.80. So that's what I want. And by the way, I

00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:52.261
want these decimal points here to line up. It turns out, that's pretty easy to

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:57.218
do. Here, instead of just calling println, we'll call a different method. It's

00:00:57.218 --> 00:01:01.538
called printf for print formatted, and here, we need to add a formatting

00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:07.090
string. The formatting string is here, it looks a little arcane. The percent

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.823
says we're now going to be printing something. The 8 means we want it to be 8

00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:19.018
characters wide, the 0.2 means, we went 2 digits after the decimal point. The f

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:23.824
means it's a floating point or decimal number. The \n means, and afterwards,

00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:28.439
please give us a new line. As you can see, there's a whole mini language in

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.703
these formatting strings and you'll practice a few of them with Sarah, after

00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:38.384
I'm done here. But truth be told, if you simply memorize this one. Or even

00:01:38.384 --> 00:01:43.520
better just copy and paste it when you need it. That's 90% of what you need.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.628
Let me do just that. So, here again, I'm going to be using a printer. I'm

00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:53.244
saying I want field with 8. 2 digits after decimal point. Now, when we run the

00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:57.227
program everything is nice and beautiful. Both numbers have two digits after

00:01:57.227 --> 00:02:04.080
the decimal point. Both of them occupy eight characters. As a general rule,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.636
whenever you display prices, go ahead and use printf. You'll practice that with

00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:10.859
Sara right now.
