00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.776
Let's try these three problems out. You want to add of subtract the like

00:00:03.776 --> 00:00:08.440
radicals, and then write your final answer in these boxes. Keep in mind, that

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.985
in this first one, we can only combine the root 5s and the root 11s. Think

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:16.183
carefully about these next two, and good luck.
