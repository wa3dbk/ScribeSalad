00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Let's look at shortest tour but -how about we look at a bit more

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.850
practical version of the shortest tour problem.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.210
So let's say first the shortest tour problem, instead of using 1 van which seems a little silly--

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:21.740
you'll realize, "Hey, let's just use a lot of vans," let's say we'll use n vans in order to deliver the mail.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.880
Now, if all vans start at the same time, well then how does this end up changing

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.140
the behavior of the problem and the complexity of the problem.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.270
Well, let's take a look at two different questions.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.430
First, let's ask how much time until all the mails delivered and all vans return to the base

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.190
in the n vans scenario and the 1 van scenario.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.800
Will the n vans take less time, less than or equal to the same amount of time,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.930
greater than equal to the same amount of time, or always greater than the time that 1 van will take.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.480
And similarly, for the sum of all individual times taken by the vans.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.540
Now, what I mean by that is--if let's say each van takes 8 hours to deliver the mail

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.430
and then return back to base, then the total amount of time would be 8 hours times n

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.240
where n is the number of vans.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.000
And is this total amount of time always going to be less than, less than or equal to,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
greater than or equal to, or always greater than the amount of time

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.000
taken by a single van to do the same thing?

00:01:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check whichever is most appropriate for both questions.
