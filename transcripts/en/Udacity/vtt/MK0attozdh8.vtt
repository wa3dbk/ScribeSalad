Now that we know how we're able to store information, it's time to turn to the

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:08.087
next crucial part in the study of memory. And that's our ability to retrieve

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:11.661
the information that we've stored. So retrieval is our ability to recall

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:17.324
information that's previously been stored in our memories. Remember we talked

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:21.660
about two different types of memory, Explicit and Implicit. And with Implicit

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.589
memory we can recall something without consciously trying to do so. I like to

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.759
tell my students an example of me trying to learn how to knit. I looked at

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.200
books and tried and tried to follow their examples to no avail. So I ended up

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.260
taking a lesson, and I had a teacher who showed me how to hold the knitting

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.605
needles. How to hold the yarn, and more importantly, how to wrap it around such

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:47.401
that I can make a knitted stitch. So I practiced and practiced my knitting and

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:52.745
I made several scarves. And then summer came and I put my knitting away. Now as

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:55.958
Christmas got closer, I thought it'd be really nice if I could knit each of my

00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:00.163
nieces a scarf. And then I realized, I'd forgotten all the rules my teacher

00:01:00.163 --> 00:01:05.288
taught me. But I did remember what I know about memory. And so I thought, just

00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:09.980
maybe, if I pick up those knitting needles, my hands will remember what to do.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.967
And that's exactly what happened. I picked up my needles and I started

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:17.452
knitting. So this is a good example of implicit memory, and more importantly,

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.020
procedural memory.
