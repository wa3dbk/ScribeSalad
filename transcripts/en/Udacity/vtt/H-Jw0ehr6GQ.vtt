00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.570
Well, the intention of this lesson is to introduce you to the topic of software

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.200
architecture. That we're going to be looking at in more detail in subsequent

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.400
lessons. The ultimate goal of course, is to produce high quality systems and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.090
reduce the cost of producing them. The key way of doing that is the early

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.030
detection of problems. And the key way of detecting things early is to

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.750
try to layout in advance, what the, what the system is going to look like.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.610
You want to have explicit recognition of what the issues are, explicit rationale

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.514
for how they are being handled. We want to be able to on the productivity side

00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:41.536
to deal with any existing assets we can apply toward the solution. And

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:46.526
we want to be able to construct an architecture at a sufficient level of

00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:50.411
abstraction. That it can be used to convey all these idea quickly and

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:52.800
effectively to all the stakeholders involved.
