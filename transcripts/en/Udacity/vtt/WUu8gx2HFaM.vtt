00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.406
The next re-factoring which is also the last one that we'll

00:00:02.406 --> 00:00:05.640
see, extract method is one of the most commonly used re-factoring. As

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.080
it is applicable in many, many situations. The starting point is

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.720
a method that is too long and contains cohesive code fragments, that

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.180
really serve a single very specific purpose. So we start from

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.270
a cohesive code fragment in a large method. What we can do

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.370
in this case, is to create a method using that code fragment.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.620
And then replacing the code fragment with a call to that method.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.390
Let's look at this with an example. Here over this method called

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.070
print owing, and what it does, imagine that it does a lot

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.850
of operations here that I'm just not listing, and then it's got

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.620
a set of print statements. That are just printing a lot of details

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.280
about the owing information. And then again, a lot of code after

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.270
that. So what I could do in this case to simplify. The

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.940
method is to transform this set of statements. They are cohesive in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.120
the sense that they do just one thing, they just print these details

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.890
into a method, and then I had, replace the statements with a

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.740
call to that method. Which is actually something similar to what we did

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.900
as part of some the previous re-factoring's. Here I'm showing the result.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.770
So here is the method that I extracted. As you can see. It

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.790
contains the code that was previously here. I give you the meaningful

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.080
name, I called it printDetails so it's clear what it does. And now

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.820
the print owning method is simpler. Because I still have the remaining code

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.200
the one I didn't touch. But now this potentially long list of details.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.560
Of prints, of details is not replaced by a single method code.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.550
So a gain similar to the previous refactorings that we saw. If

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.370
we just look at the printing method, it's very easy to figure

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.490
out what this part does. Oh, print some details. And once more I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.060
really want to stress this. If you don't care about how, this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.350
is implemented and knowing that this print some details is enough. Then

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.980
you're done. You don't need to understand anything more. It's clear, it's

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.430
self explanatory. And if you'll need to look at what print details does,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.390
you just go and look at print details. And you look at

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.280
it in isolation. So it's easier to understand what this does without having

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.640
to think the rest of the code. So once more the color we

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.740
factor in is just to improve your design, made the code more readable

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.020
Make the code more maintainable. And also keep in mind all of these,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.080
are kind of small examples. You also always have to think about the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.560
effect that this can have on larger codebases. It can really improve a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.280
lot. The understandabililty, and maintainability of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.220
your code. So in general, it's design.
