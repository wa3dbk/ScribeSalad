Let's start by just looking at the first entry in each of the xy tables and

00:00:04.829 --> 00:00:09.537
seeing which graph it matches to. Brand number 1 should have a line that has the

00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:14.479
0.0100 in it. So, we go over to our graph, the 0.0100 is this line. Let's follow

00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:19.296
that up. So, brand 1 should go along with this line that comes in second here.

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:25.176
Brand 2 has a 0.0200, which starts out highest and then ends up with this third

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:30.931
arrow over here. That means brand 3 should be this graph. But let's just double

00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:36.843
check to make sure. This line should contain the 0.0150. And if we follow it

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.610
down, sure enough, that's on the line.
