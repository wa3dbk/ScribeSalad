00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.740
Okay, back to our list again.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.150
Hopefully, now you've
created your action sheet and

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.960
implemented the method,
Launch Photo Library.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.180
So, your app might look
something like this.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.255
Here's the action sheet.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:17.250
And here, I press Choose from Existing,
and I'm able to choose this video.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.650
I took this video where I'm
pretending to squish my coworker.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.030
And then,
just like with the newly recorded video,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.420
I can see my GIF in the GIF editor, and
I have the option to add a caption.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.600
So, convert a video from the photo
album into a GIF, checked.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510
We're getting to the homestretch.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.138
We just need to enable some simple
editing to improve GIF composition,

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:43.760
namely, we're going to allow the user to
trim a video before it's converted into

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.820
a GIF and
constrain the GIF to be square, so

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.125
that it doesn't get distorted.
