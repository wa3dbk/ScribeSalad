00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.480
So here is what all of our numbers are equal to. I hope your guesses were

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.720
close. I think looking at this last log down here, log base 10 of 3 million,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.108
gives us a clue as to what's happening. Notice that this is equal to 6.47712,

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:20.934
and we're taking the log of 3 times 10 to the 6th. So we have a 6 here and we

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:26.558
have a 6 right here. Noticing that this decimal here is the same as for log

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:31.396
base 10 of 3, it looks like what we have is log base 10 of 3, accounting for

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:39.760
the .47712, plus log base 10 of 1 million. Since this is just 10 to the 6th.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.871
That means that this is where we get that other 6 from, to make up this whole

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:44.109
answer.
