00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Today we're going to talk about partners.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.070
Who are your key partners and suppliers?

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.410
We've already talked about value propositions, customer segments,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.740
distribution channels, customer relationships, and revenue streams.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.050
Now we're going to talk about our partners.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.830
What's interesting about partners is these are other companies

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.430
who provide you resources.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.330
They might be partners, they might be suppliers,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.390
but they're needed to make your business model work,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.170
and these partners and suppliers might supply or give you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.520
resources, activities, and other things that are essential

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.770
for your company to succeed.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.820
So what you need to understand is what type of relationships

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.390
you need to have with them.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.650
Are these relationships going to be strategic alliances

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.540
between noncompeting companies?

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.510
Are they going to be joint ventures?

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.760
Are they going to be coopetition?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.280
What are you going to do, and what are they going to do?

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.900
So, in this lecture, we are going to explain

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.150
the differences, the pitfalls, and the successes between each.
