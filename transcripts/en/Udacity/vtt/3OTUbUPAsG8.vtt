00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.374
Here, the solution is 7 6ths, or 1 and 1 6th. Nice thinking if you found this

00:00:06.374 --> 00:00:11.260
fraction. Basically, we're just going to evaluate our inverse function at x

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.620
equals 2. So we just plug in the value of 2, and for x. So 2 plus 5 equals 7.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.284
And I still have 6 for my denominator. So 7 6ths or 1 and 1 6th. Now, there was

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:30.295
another way to solve this problem. If we remember that the x and y coordinates

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:36.216
switch for the inverse function, then we can make the y coordinate be 2. In

00:00:36.216 --> 00:00:41.419
other words, we know the input for the inverse function would be 2. This means

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:46.743
that it must be a y value for the original function. So, we could take our

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:53.380
original function and let this output or this y value equal 2 and solve for x.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.479
Letting this f of x equal 2, we can now solve for x. We'll have 6x equal to 7

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:06.094
and then we'll divide both sides by positive 6 to get x equals 7 6ths. Since x

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:10.190
is the input for the original function, we know this will be the output for our

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.300
inverse function. Remember that the x and y coordinates will always switch for

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.086
the function and it's inverse. Now, I know the second method is a lot longer

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:24.626
for finding our answer, since all we really needed to do was plug in 2 into

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:30.321
here. But it's worth conceptually noting, so that way we can understand that

00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:35.440
the inverse and its function always have the x and y coordinates switched.
