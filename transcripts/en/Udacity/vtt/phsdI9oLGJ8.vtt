00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.540
Here the answers are positive 9 and positive 4. Great work for factoring, if

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.943
you found these two. We factor this equation by finding factors of positive 36

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:16.568
that sum to negative 13. Those two factors are negative 9 and negative 4. We

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:22.863
set each factor equal to 0 to get u could equal 9 or u could equal positive 4.
