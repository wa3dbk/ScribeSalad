00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.042
So now that we know how big the virtual
index physical tag cache can be to

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:09.870
avoid aliasing,
let's do a VIPT aliasing avoidance quiz.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.070
Let's say we want a cache that
is 4-way set associative and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.000
has a 16 byte block size, And let's say
that the system has an 8kB page size.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.030
If we want no aliasing in this cache,
its maximum size can be how many kB?
