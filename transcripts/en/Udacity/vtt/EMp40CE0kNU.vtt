00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now we have to introduce some extra constraints so that this truth assignment has to be satisfied.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And to do that, we're going to introduce a set of nodes

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
for each clause that is sometimes referred to as a gadget.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
These gadgets come up a lot in NP-completeness proofs.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In this case, it's going to be a little piece of a graph but it's going to be a little piece of a graph that has

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
particular mechanics to it that makes the graph act like a three-set problem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
All right, now we're going to extend this graph by adding a gadget for each clause.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A gadget is going to be a little chunk of a graph but it's going to have very particular property to it

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that it's going to be three-colorable in the context to the rest of the graph

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
if and only if the corresponding clause is satisfiable in the context of the assignment.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So let's imagine that we've got, this is our clause (l₁, l₂, l₃).

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
All right, there's a couple different ways of making this gadget,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Here's one that makes sense to me.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Essentially, these are going to be little triangles, that kind of correspond to or expressions

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and the or of l₁ and l₂ or'd with l₃ is going to give us the answer for the clause.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So, here's the sixth node.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
They're going to be connected to some of the nodes that are already in the graph.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In particular, the three literals that are in that clause and the slack variable in the middle

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
slack node in the middle and false node off the side

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and just to simply things, remind you that false node is colored black, the slack node is colored red,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and this literal nodes are either going to be blue or black each one.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And now, what I'd like to do is show you the different ways of coloring these

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
either allow the rest of this structure to be colored with three colors or not.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So let's start off with the case where all three of the literals are false.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That's an important case because if the assignment is such

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that the literals are all false then this clause it's not satisfied.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This clause is not satisfied so the whole formula is not satisfied.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So this is going to be important to make sure that this graph is not going to be colorful.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So given that these two nodes are connected to slack, neither of them can be red.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So this one in particular can either be blue or black.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
If this one is color blue, then that means neither of this can be colored blue

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and neither of these can be colored black, so they have to be both colored red and that doesn't work.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So this can't be blue and it can't be red, so it has to be black.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This can either be blue or red, it doesn't matter which is which.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
All right, so now we have this node.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Well this node is kind of obvious, it's connected to red and black, so it has to be blue.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now this node is connected to blue and black, so it has to be red.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And this node is connected to red, blue, and black so we are in trouble.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So the graph was not colorable when these three literals are all black.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But if this literal is blue, well that means that one of the literals in clause is true,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
so the whole clause should be true so this better be colorable.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Okay, by the same argument before, this is red and black so this one has to be blue as well.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So looks like we're okay.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We're able to assign colors to all these nodes so that none of the coloring constraints are violated.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So that's okay. So this one is blue and these guys are black.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Actually this one doesn't matter what it is, that thing is colorable.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So this could either be blue or black. What if this one was blue, that's going to be okay too.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We can just swap the two colors of these nodes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
All right, so what that means is if this one is blue, the thing is colorable. Definitely.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So one of them is true, that's if this one is true, that's enough.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So let's consider the case where this one is black and one of the other guys is blue.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
All right, so this one is forced to be blue.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Since this one is black and this one is blue, this one is forced to be red,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
which means this one's forced to be black which means this one's forced to be blue

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and now we're in good shape because this one is black and this one is red

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and now we have a valid coloring, actually no matter what l₂ is colored.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In the same argument where it's to be switched, which one of these two is blue?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We can just swap these two colors and everything is fine. So what did we just show?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So, this gadget for this clause is colorable as long as

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the three literals it's connected to are not all black.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And that's great because that's exactly what the satisfiability condition is.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So we create one of these gadgets for each for each in the clauses

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
connect them to the rest of the graph and now we get this giant graph

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and that whole graph is satisfied, if and only all the gadgets can be colored,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which is the same as saying if and only all the clauses can be satisfied

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and since they're all connected with n, that's exactly what we wanted it to be.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So this graph that we built is colorable if and only the entire formula is satisfiable. That's kind of cool.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Right. So, even though a formula with boolean variables in it

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and a graph with different colors in it, feel like very different problems

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
in a very deep fundamental mathematical way, they're really the same problem.
