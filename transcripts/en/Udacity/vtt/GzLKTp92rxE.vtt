00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.010
After learning about watch faces,
you now have a complete understanding

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.290
of how to write any kind of
application for Android wear.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.730
Watches have been used for hundreds
of years to be able to tell the time

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.300
as well as a personal
statement of style.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.100
Now you have the ability to dream up
any kind of watch face design, and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.020
then implement it on Android wear.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.860
This will keep your users up to date and

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.830
on time with relevant information to
their life all with a simple glance.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.650
I'm looking forward to seeing what kinds
of beautiful watch faces you develop for

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.800
android wear users.
