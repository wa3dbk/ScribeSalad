00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So if we were able to assume the discrete log is hard,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
then we could prove that Diffie-Hellman is secure

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
if we could show that breaking Diffie-Hellman

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
implies that one can also solve the discrete log problem.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
No one has been able to prove that.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Instead the security of Diffie-Hellman relies on a stronger assumption--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what's known as the Decisional Diffie-Hellman Assumption.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is a little bit circular that we're basing the security argument for Diffie-Hellman

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
on an assumption that was invented because this is what Diffie-Hellman relies on.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That seems a bit circular, and indeed it is.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But it is a useful way of crystallizing what we really rely on

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to know that the Diffie-Hellman protocol is secure.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And what we're relying on is this property that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
G to the XY mod Q, and this is how we're computing the key

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
when the XY values--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
one is a secret value, and one is the value that was sent in the previous message--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and the assumption is that this value, which is G to the XY mod Q,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and that's the value that's computed as the key in the Diffie-Hellman protocol,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is indistinguishable from random

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
even to an attacker who knows G, G to the X, G to the Y, and Q--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
these are the messages that would be intercepted.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So if this assumption is true,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that would be enough to prove that the Diffie-Hellman protocol is secure,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and that an attacker who eavesdrops on all the messages can't compute the key

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because what the assumption is stating is that there is no way that they could tell

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that that value, which is the correct key, is any different from a random number

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
even when they have access to this information.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So this is an assumption, and it's even worse than that--

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
it's known that it's not true for certain values.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We can show that it is distinguishable from random.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So the security of the Diffie-Hellman protocol would follow from this assumption

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
if we knew this assumption were true.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We don't, but people have been trying for a long time to break Diffie-Hellman,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and so far it seems to be adequately secure.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That is certainly not enough to guarantee that it always will be.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Next we're going to talk about some issues in actually implementing Diffie-Hellman.
