So let's get started using Pointer Events. To use the

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.190
polyfill, you just need to include the library in your project.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.820
Or if you are already using polymer, you don't need to

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.630
do that. I am in my synthesizer app, so I don't

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.280
need to include anything else. Then, for each element that you

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.521
want to get Pointer Events, you need to add a touch-action

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:22.500
attribute. This let's the system know that you want to consume

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.780
the events rather than having them use to do default actions

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.500
like scrolling.
