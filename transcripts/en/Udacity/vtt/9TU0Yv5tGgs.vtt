Cay and I are in a twitter battle. I claimed that I will always have at least

00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:10.380
one more twitter follower than he has. In other words, my number of twitter

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.644
followers will always be greater than or equal to the number that Cay has plus

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:19.397
one. Is this true, if Cay has three followers and I have a four. What about

00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:26.152
this statement that Cay plus one is greater than or equal to Sara. How about

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:30.063
the statement Cay plus one does not equal Sara?
