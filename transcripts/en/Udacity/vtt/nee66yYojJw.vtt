00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.930
Let us now test our
understanding of Raid 0.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.620
Supposed that we are building
a Raid 0 Array with four disks.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.670
Suppose that for one such disk,
we get 200 GB capacity,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.350
10 MB of throughput and
an MTTF of 100,000 hours.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.710
So our Raid 0 Array can store
how many GB, has a throughput of

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.640
how many megabytes per second,
and an MTTF of how many hours?
