00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:03.320
A UML state transition diagram does not specify a set

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.960
of object that work together to perform some action, because

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.270
this is what a sequence diagram does instead. Conversely, the

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.530
second one is correct. As we said, a state transition diagram

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.790
describes the events that cause a transition from one state

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.300
to another. Again, a UML state transition diagram does not

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.270
specify the set of components in a system, because this

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.700
is what a component diagram does, not a state transition diagram.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.620
As for the last one, this is correct,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.510
because, as we also discussed, a state transition diagram

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.000
describes the actions that result from a state

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.890
change, that is, the effects of such state change.
