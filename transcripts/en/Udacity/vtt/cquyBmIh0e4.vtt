00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now we're going to talk about oracles.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We really probably have deferred this topic for too long.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Oracles are extremely important for random testing

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because if you don't have an automated oracle--that is to say,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
if you don't have an automated way to tell if a test case did something interesting--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
then you've got nothing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And in fact, Richard Hamlet in his sort of well-known article on random testing

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
said that "random testing has only a specialized niche in practice

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
"because an effective oracle is seldom available."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And this is something that I don't actually agree with.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What we're going to see is that sometimes you have to use some imagination,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but really, there are potentially quite a few oracles available

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that almost always we can make something work

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
even if it's just a weak oracle like watching out for crashes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So what I'm going to do is organize the oracles that are suitable for random testing

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
into a collection of categories.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So we're going to start off with weak oracles.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Weak oracles are some of the ones that are most useful in practice,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but I'm calling them weak because they can only enforce fairly generic properties

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
about the software under test.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The most important weak oracle is just detecting whether or not

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the application crashed.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What a crash usually really means is that the system under test

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
violated some rule that the hardware imposed like, for example,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
memory accesses have to be aligned,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or that the operating system imposed like, for example,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the application isn't allowed to try to write to memory that's owned by the kernel,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and in response to this violation, the operating system has decided to terminate the process

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in which the software under test is contained.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The second most useful weak oracle is violation of a programming language rule.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In Python, if you try to access an element of a list that's out of bounds

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and if you don't catch the resulting exception,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
then your Python program will get terminated.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That's an example of the violation of a language rule killing an application

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and serving as an oracle that tells us basically that something went wrong.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And basically, most any programming language has a number of rules like this

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and the stronger those rules are, the more effective of an oracle

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the programming language runtime can serve as.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And one of the reasons why C and C++ applications crash so much

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
is because the language is an extremely weak enforcer of runtime rules,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and so basically, all of the enforcement falls upon the operating system

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and the hardware itself.
