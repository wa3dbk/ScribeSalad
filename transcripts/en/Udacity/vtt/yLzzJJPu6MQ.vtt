00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Dave] So for question 4, we want to see that you understand

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
how to use and make assignments to variables.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The question is "Write Python code that stores the distance in meters

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that light travels in one nanosecond in the variable nanodistance."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The variables below are predefined for you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're storing the speed of light in the variable speed_of_light.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And that's 299,800,000.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And I have the dot at the end of this to make sure that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when you do arithmetic we'll get decimal variables instead

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of just doing integer arithmetic on the speed of light.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The second variable is nano_per_second,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and there are 1 billion nanoseconds in 1 second.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And your goal is to write code that assigns to the variable

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
nanodistance the distance in meters that light travels in 1 nanosecond.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And if you've done that correctly, after you run your code,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
when you print the value of nanodistance,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
it should output 0.2998,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
indicating that light travels almost 30 centimeters in 1 nanosecond.
