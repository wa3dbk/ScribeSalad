00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.570
The critical values for this inequality are x equals 3 halves, and x equals 5.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.173
So this splits the number line into three different intervals. let's pick a

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:13.000
value from each interval and test it. From over here on the left, I'll pick 0.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.976
And if I plug that in, I end up with a negative number over a negative number,

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:21.140
or a positive number which is greater than 0. So yes, this interval checks off.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.542
If I pick a number in this middle region, like three, then they'll end up with

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:28.106
a positive number over a negative number, which makes a negative number, which

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:34.140
is not greater than 0. So this interval does not work. Over on the right,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.520
plugging in six for x does check out. So this region should be shaded as well.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.920
On a number line then, our solution looks like this. With of course, rounded

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.393
open brackets showing that 5 and 3 halves are not included. Written as an

00:00:47.393 --> 00:00:51.362
inequality then, our solution should be x is less than 3 halves joined with x

00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:53.693
is greater than 5.
