00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.040
So to speed up virtual to physical
translation, the processor includes

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.119
a structure called the translation
look-aside buffer or TLB.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.890
The TLB is a cache for translations.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.090
So now you would ask yourself, well,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.810
how is the TLB better than
just using the cache itself?

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.780
Well, first,
the cache is relatively big.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.520
It could store a lot of translations,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.470
if we only held translations there,
but we don't.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.890
Most of the stuff is
in the cache is data.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.240
One translation in the cache
covers a whole page worth of data.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.110
So, the TLB that caches only
translations can be extremely small,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.160
which means extremely fast.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.740
Let's look, for example, at the program
that accesses 16 kilobytes of data.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.050
For that to work well we need
about 16 kilobytes of cache.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.790
But this is only four pages if
we have a four kilobyte page.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.290
So the TLB that corresponds to that only

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.330
needs four entries to cover
the same amount of memory.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.770
And with only four entries we can make
the TLB extremely, extremely fast,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.270
much less than a cycle for
each translation.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.320
Next we have seen that in a multi level
page table we access our cache for

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.250
each level of the page table because
we need to look up all those

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880
entries in order to find
the final translation.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.510
In contrast, the TLB only
stores the final translation.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.630
Even if you have a four
level page table,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.580
eventually we find what a given
page number maps to and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.380
we just store the frame number in the
TLB, not the intermediate page stable

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.980
entries that we have been using to
finally come up with a translation.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.460
So in our cache we will
have a 4-level page table,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.590
4 accesses to do the translation.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.840
In the TLB, we do this in 1 access.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.680
So now a load or a store just
needs to form the address, access

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.430
the TLB to find the translation, and
then access the cache to get the data.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.140
If we have both the TLB hit and the
cache hit, this can be done in one or

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.710
two cycles.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.530
But what if we have a TLB miss?

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.510
What if we do not find
a translation in the TLB?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.590
In that case we need to perform
the translation using the page table,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.650
or page tables if we have
a multiple level page table.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.090
And then put that
translation in our TLB so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.900
that it can be used later when
we access the same page again.
