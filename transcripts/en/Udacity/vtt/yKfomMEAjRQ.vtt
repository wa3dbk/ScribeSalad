00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.590
Now it's your turn to
write some media queries.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.270
You'll be using dev tools to
make some changes to this page.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.750
Inside the elements pane,
open up the head.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.650
There, you'll find a style tag,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.450
and inside the style tag, you've got
some breakpoints set up for you.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.250
And it's here within the style tag,
that I want you to make your changes.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.730
Simply right click and do edit as HTML.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.490
And you'll be able to change it.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.510
Apply style, so

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.520
that between zero and 400 pixels,
the background color changes to red.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.880
And then between 401 and 599 pixels,
the background should be green.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.450
And if the page is 600 pixels or
wider, make the background blue.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.090
When you've set the right break points,
you'll see a code on the screen.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.100
Type it in here to continue.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.400
And by the way, you might find it's
easier to actually write your code in

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.280
a regular code editor like
Sublime Text and then paste it in here
