00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, so we're going to have a last quiz for this section,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it's going to be a fairly challenging one.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So we'll give it a gold star.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Your goal here is to define a procedure, "biggest",

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that takes 3 inputs that are all numbers

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it outputs the greatest of the 3 numbers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So here's a few examples:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So if the 3 inputs are "6", "2", and "3" the output of "biggest" should be "6".

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If the 3 inputs are "6", "2", and "7", then the output of "biggest" should be "7".

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And if the 3 inputs are "6", "9", and "3", the output should be "9".

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So whichever of the 3 inputs is the greatest number,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is the output that your procedure should produce, and it should return that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So I've shown the outputs.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We wouldn't actually see them, unless we printed them out.
