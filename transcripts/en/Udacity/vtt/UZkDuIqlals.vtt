Thanks for taking a moment and responding. Now there are several ways that this

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:07.648
disorder can potentially impair a person's life, so let's take a look at this

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:12.490
in more detail. First we see that people with schizophrenia experience a

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.610
decline in their overall level of functioning. This means that it can be

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.501
difficult for a person to work at a job that requires a level of skill and

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:26.108
concentration that they may have had prior to the onset of the disorder. In

00:00:26.108 --> 00:00:31.120
devastating cases, the person loses the ability to be a working individual.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.512
Moreover, demands such as raising the children, taking care of the house, or

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:38.116
meeting societal demands becomes overwhelming, such that the person is not able

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:40.900
to function appropriately.
