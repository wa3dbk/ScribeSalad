00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.782
On these two separate graphs right now, I put all of the parent polynomial

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:07.939
functions that we've talked about so far. And they're grouped according to which

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.832
ones he said had similar end behavior. Or in other words, similar behavior at

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:15.736
either tail of the graph moving away from to origin. However, I have added one

00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:19.579
extra graph, we didn't talk about in this session explicitly and that's the

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:24.361
graph of y equals x. Remember that technically the variable x is a polynomial.

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:29.070
It's just a polynomial of first degree. Pretty simple. I know that it looks

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.479
pretty different from both x cubed and x to the 5th, but I do have a reason for

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.765
putting it over here. You'll see in a second. First of all though, the similar

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:41.175
behavior of graphs over here and of graphs over here, has led these groups of

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:45.773
functions to have names. All the functions on one of these two graphs are even

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:50.219
functions. And the other set are odd functions. So which one do you think is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.667
which? I've labeled this set of graphs a, and this set of graphs b. Just use

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.213
your common sense to answer this question.
