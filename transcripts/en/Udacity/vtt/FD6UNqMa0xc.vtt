00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.160
So you're about to watch the Udacity
interview confessionals.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.110
This is a montage video of Udacity
employees talking about various

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.970
interview fails that they've
gone through in their careers.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.470
We show you these videos not because
we want to scare you off of interviews.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.190
But to show you that while it might feel
very isolating to to go on an interview

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.100
on your own, we all go through the same
kind of mistakes and pains that you

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.700
probably are going through or
have gone through or will go through.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.470
And hopefully you'll remember these
videos and remember that each

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.820
opportunity that you have going into an
interview is an opportunity to practice.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.980
And an opportunity to move
forward in your career.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.480
Good luck.
