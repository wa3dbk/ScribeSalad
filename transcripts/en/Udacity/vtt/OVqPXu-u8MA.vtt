00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.360
For the solution we look for the list array.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.070
Each element in the list represents one days forecast. Given

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.860
the day index we find the temperature node and then

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.700
the max temperature. And this is what the code would

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.340
look like. We change the JSON string into a JSON

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.590
object. Then we look for the list array. Within that

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.730
we find the day we care about. Then we look

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.660
for the temp node. And then find the max temperature.
