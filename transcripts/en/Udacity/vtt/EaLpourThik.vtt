00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.570
Protocols and extensions are both
tools Swift uses to package modules of

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.430
functionality that expand upon classes,
enumerations and structs.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.760
Protocols can be shared
across classes and

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.160
extensions are used to
customize existing classes.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.720
They both provide ways to reuse code and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.400
adhere to the principle
of dry programming.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.439
That is to say, don't repeat yourself.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.610
Let's focus on protocols for the moment.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.430
If you're familiar with Java or C#,
you may have heard of interfaces before.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.100
A protocol, much like an interface,
is a list of related method signatures.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.390
When a Swift class enumeration or
struct adopts a protocol,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.830
they're signing a contract to implement
every method belonging to said protocol.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.580
This provides us a very powerful
high level abstraction.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.050
For example, we can reason.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.010
Anything that conforms to Apple's
built-in comparable protocol can be

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.817
compared.

00:00:58.817 --> 00:00:59.996
And iOS development,

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:03.349
protocols are an essential
component of the delegate pattern,

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:08.300
the pattern by which one type calls upon
another type to perform some operation.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.470
For a deeper dive into
the delegate pattern,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.750
follow the links in
the instructor's notes.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.019
Here, we're going to focus on
the syntax of defining, adopting, and

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:18.717
implementing protocols.
