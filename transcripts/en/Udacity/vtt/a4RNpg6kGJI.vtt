00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.969
Let's see another comparison
of updates and invalidates.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.780
This time let's look at two cores
that execute the following program,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.110
core 0 will read and then write A and
this is repeated 500 times.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.230
And then core 1 will read and then write
A, and this is repeated 500 times.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.360
And meanwhile nothing else
happens in this core.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.030
So nothing gets replaced.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.430
The question for you is again, how many
bus uses do we get with the write-update

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.750
protocol and with the write-invalidate
protocol in this case?
