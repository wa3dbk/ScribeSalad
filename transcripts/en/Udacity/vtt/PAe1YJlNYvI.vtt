00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.320
So Paul, what actually happens
when you connect your build process

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.846
to the browser?

00:00:03.846 --> 00:00:07.598
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Magic.

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:10.455
&gt;&gt; I'm going to need you
to be a bit more specific.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:12.008
&gt;&gt; All right, all right then,

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.040
let me tell you about the magical
world of live editing.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.380
Say your job is to construct shelves,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.399
just imagine how much your life
would suck without a power drill.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.560
Sure, a manual screwdriver does the job,
and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.700
works, if you're just constructing
a shelf for yourself once a year.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.770
But a power drill will save you lots
of time and energy in the long run, and

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.750
leave you great optimization.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.158
Unless your plan is to get
Popeye's arms, of course.

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:38.870
In the world of web development,
you'll see a very similar pattern.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.152
You make a change to your code,
save, rebuild if you need to,

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:43.840
switch to the browser and
reload the page.

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:47.480
These micro context switches
might seem harmless, but

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.370
you're doing this thousands
of times each day.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.730
If you now ask yourself, well,
surely there's a better way then?

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.290
You'd be right.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.850
Live Editing solves
exactly that problem.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.300
It works by having
a watcher in your editor or

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.830
build process that's connected to
a similar watcher in the browser.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.040
When you save a file,
these two communicate, and

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.710
the website is reloaded or patched on
the fly without you having to intervene.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.820
That means fewer contact switches as you
can now have your editor right next to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.390
your browser window and
see changes happen as you code.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.250
In the next hands on step, James is
going to be teaching you how to set up

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.830
Live Editing in three different ways.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.720
Live on every keystroke in Sublime,
on every save via Gulp, and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.990
skipping the editor all together to move
your entire workflow into the browser.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.010
In the end,
we prefer to build two versions, and

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.970
James is going to tell you why.
