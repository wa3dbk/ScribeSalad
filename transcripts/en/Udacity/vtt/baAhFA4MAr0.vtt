00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.095
So, once again, we're
going to replace

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:04.160
the one remaining part of our test

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.270
that still has a standard database.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.460
Let's actually get rid of our database.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.000
That leaves us
with this lonely insert statement.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.793
Once again, like with everything else,

00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:17.646
we're going to replace that
with a content resolver call.

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:21.150
And of course we're actually not
going to be inserting the table.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.800
We're going to be inserting
the content URI.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.510
Getting rid of the nulls.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.870
Of course this doesn't
return a location row ID.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.080
That's alright.
We can pull it from the URI.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.970
Using the helper function from content URI's,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.650
we can leave that assert in there,
although it's not necessary.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.390
And the rest of everything should
pretty much be as it always is.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.460
We're no longer using a database at all
within test provider,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.650
but entirely using the content provider.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.668
Let's run our tests and see if they still work.

00:00:51.668 --> 00:00:53.571
(silence)

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.094
And they all pass.

00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:00.637
Congratulations, we now
have a fully functioning

00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:02.890
content provider that can both
insert and query.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.770
But, of course, there are other things
you might want to do

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.130
with the content provider.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.690
Now, we're not actually going to use

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.000
any of these things in Sunshine.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.110
But it's really important to know.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.620
So, I suggest you
actually implement these functions.
