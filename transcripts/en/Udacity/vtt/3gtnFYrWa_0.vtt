00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.310
Now I'm going to introduce you to a

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.380
lazy version of the RC memory model. And it's

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.460
called LRC, stands for lazy RC. Now this is

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.290
the structure of your pilot program so a thread

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.860
acquires a lot, does the data accessing, releases the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.970
lock. Another thread may acquire the same lock. And

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.080
if the critical section for P1 Precedes the critical

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.720
section for P2, then the RC memory model requires

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.210
that, at the point of release, you

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.740
ensure that all the modifications that have been

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.740
made on processor P1, that is, the

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.535
coherence actions. That are commensurate with those data

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:42.550
acceses, are all communicated to all the

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.629
peer processes including P2. Then you release the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.670
lock. That's the semantic. And this is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.050
what is called eager release consistency, meaning that

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.910
at the point of release you're insuring that the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.640
whole system is cache coherent The whole system is

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.450
cache coherent at the point of release, then you

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.050
release from the lock. And the cache coherence is

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.540
with respect to the set of data accesses that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.830
have gone on on this process up to this

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.710
point, that's what we are ensuring has been communicated

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.070
and made consistent on all the processes. Now let's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.730
say that the timeline looks like this and P1's

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.880
release happened at this point. And P2's acquire of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.600
the same lock happened at a much later point

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.000
in time. That's the luck of the draw in

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.600
terms of how the computation went, and so there

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.510
is this time window between P1's release of the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.560
lock and P2's acquisition of the same lock. Now

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.300
if you think about it there's an opportunity for procrastination.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.360
Now we saw that procrastination often helps in

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.210
system design. We've seen this in mutual exclusion locks.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.100
If you insert delay between successive trials of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.470
trying to get the lock, that actually results in

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.310
better performance. We saw that in processes scheduling

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.040
too. Instead of eagerly scheduling the next available task

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.170
Maybe you want to wait for a task

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.450
that has more affinity to your processor. That results

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.190
in performance advantage. So procrastination often is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520
a good friend of system design. So

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.210
here again there is an opportunity for

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.120
procrastination. So Lazy RC is another instance

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.480
where procrastination may actually help in optimizing

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.700
the system performance. The idea is that,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.940
rather than performing all the coherence actions

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.200
at the point of release. Don't do it,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.540
procrastinate. Wait till the acquire actually happens.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.560
At the point of acquire, take all the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.550
coherence actions before allowing this acquire to succeed.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.730
So the key point is that you're deafening

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.260
the point at which you ensure that all

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.050
the coherence actions are complete to the point

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.020
of acquisition as opposed to the point of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.500
release. Even if all the coherence actions commensurate

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.300
with the data accesses that have gone on

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.840
up until this release point, are not yet

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.590
complete when we hit the release, go ahead.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.070
Release the lock, but if the next lock acquisition

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.970
happens, at that point, make sure that all

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.720
the coherence actions are complete. So in other words,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.579
you get an opportunity to overlap computation with

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.540
communication once again in this window of time between

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.800
release of a lock, and the acquisition of the same lock.
