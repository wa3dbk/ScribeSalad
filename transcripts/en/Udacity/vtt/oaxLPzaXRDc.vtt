00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.880
Trees have a lot of properties
that make them useful.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.620
However, a tree is really just
an extension of a linked list.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.549
A linked list has one
element at the front and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.990
a next pointer to another element,
and so on.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.980
A tree is similar.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.900
The first element is called the root.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.930
Instead of having just one next element,
a tree can have several.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.150
A linked list is often
drawn horizontally, but

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.320
a tree is normally drawn
vertically like this.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.200
Just like a linked list, each element
on a tree contains some data.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.600
The individual elements in a tree that
contain values are often called nodes.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.430
Let's add a few more constraints
on what we call a tree.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.419
First of all,
a tree must be completely connected.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.730
That means,
if you're starting from the root,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.470
there must be some way to
reach every node in the tree.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.630
Here is an example of unconnected nodes.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.740
So this definitely isn't a tree.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.480
Next, there must not be
any cycles in the tree.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.620
A cycle occurs when there's a way for
you to encounter the same node twice.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.220
For example, in this tree there
is a connection back to the root.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.390
If I start at the root,
then I'll get back to the root.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.720
The same goes for this tree.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.500
If you ignore the arrows,
you can still go in a circle.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.729
This counts as a cycle.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.500
So beware.
