00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.432
Looking at these intervals that we said satisfy our inequality, the first one

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:08.618
tells us that x can be less than 4. That inequality is part of our solution.

00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:12.914
However there's this other interval down here, that also has some acceptable

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:17.184
solutions. That's from x equals 9 and onward, so we can have x is less than 4,

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:20.987
or x is greater than or equal to 9. So you can see already, how useful and

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:25.019
really necessary using a table like this is, to come up with the solutions for

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.171
rational inequalities. It's not even always easy to tell whether or not your

00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:33.106
intervals will contain or not contain the endpoints. So we just need to be

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:37.432
really careful and write out all of our steps. In interval notation, we can

00:00:37.432 --> 00:00:42.552
express these intervals. The first one goes from negative infinity to 4, neither

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:47.591
endpoint being included. And as united, we write that with this capital U with

00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:52.725
the interval 9 to infinity where 9 is included, and infinity, of course is not.
