00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
Now finally, I would like you to figure two more--this one down here

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.950
and this one down here, and the rules again are the same.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.350
I'm not going to draw in the little errors just so that you can still see the image,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.330
but you still have to move in this direction here from A to B and the same down here.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.390
How many ways are their from A to B in this graph up here

00:00:17.390 --> 99:59:59.000
and how many ways are there to get from A to B in this graph down here.
