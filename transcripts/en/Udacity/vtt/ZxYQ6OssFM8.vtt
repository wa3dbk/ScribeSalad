00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.896
In this new unit we're going to be looking at Quadratic Equations and

00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:07.870
Inequalities. These are going to be equations and inequalities that have a

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.586
variable squared. Now I know we already learned how to factor quadratics from

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:15.990
before and we even used that to help us solve quadratic equations. We're going

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.320
to learn some other methods that we can use to also help us solve these. Let's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.364
review factoring quadratics before we get started. How do we even know if a

00:00:23.364 --> 00:00:28.144
quadratic is factorable? If this is factorable, there must be factors of blank

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:32.665
that sum to blank. I want you to fill in these blanks with one of the choices

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:37.800
below. What do we know must be true, if we can factor this expression?
