00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:04.700
Now we can try to calculate the most similar case of the new problem based

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.130
solely on the origin. The two dimensional grid here tries to represent both all

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.370
the cases and in your problem. Of course we can also calculate the similarity of

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.040
the new problem with the old cases based on destination. This two dimensional

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.350
grid captures the cases and the problem based on the destination. You

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.450
can compute the [UNKNOWN] distance from Q in all the cases placed on the origin,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.140
shown here. And you can do the same thing with the destination, shown here.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.410
If we focus only on the origin, then the B case seems the closest. If we focus

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.330
solely on the destination, the E case seems the closest. However, the B case is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.220
not very good when we look at the destination. And the E case is not very

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.050
good when you look at the origin. How then might an AI agent find out which is

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.440
the best route of all of these choices? How might it decide D is the best route?
