00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.580
Let's apply scan in an interesting way,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.170
namely in parellelizing
the quicksort algorithm.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.460
And I know quicksort is your favorite
algorithm from computer science

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.950
elementary school.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.250
First, let me remind you how to
do a quicksort sequentially.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.362
It's all based on what I'll
call a quicksort step.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:21.300
A quicksort step is a kind of dance
move for people like me who have two or

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.910
more left feet.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.530
The first part of a quicksort
step is choosing a pivot element.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.860
Now, any element can work, but

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.490
a good choice is to select
one uniformly at random.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.040
So for this 12-element array,
you might roll a 12-sided die and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.530
pick, I don't know, this element.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.650
The next part of a quicksort
step is to partition the input

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.500
around the pivot value.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.620
That means get all the elements that
are less than or equal to the pivot and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.360
put them on one side.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.780
And get all the elements that
are greater than the pivot and

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.769
put them on the other side.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.060
By doing so,
you now have two subparts of the array

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.680
that can be sorted completely
independently from one another.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.654
That ends the quick step.

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:02.811
Now, since the two
halves are independent,

00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:04.810
you can spawn them as independent tasks.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.690
And you just keep repeating
the quick step until you're done.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.980
Choose a pivot, partition and spawn.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.880
Here's the algorithm more formally.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.040
First, it chooses a pivot at random.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.940
Then it partitions
the input around the pivot.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.550
Then it conquers these two halves.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.470
And finally, it glues these
two results back together.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.940
Quick and easy.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.040
Well, except for one detail.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.030
How do you do this
partition step in parallel?
