00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] The answer is 0.34.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
To compute this, we need to use the conditional probability rule.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We already know the probability of B, which is X is a vowel.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We computed that in question 1 as 0.38.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What we need is the probability of A intersect B.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, B is--the events were X is a vowel.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A are the events where is equal to E.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Whenever X is equal is to E, it's also a vowel.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That intersection probability is the same as the probability that X is equal to E,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which is 0.13, and dividing those we get the result 0.34.
