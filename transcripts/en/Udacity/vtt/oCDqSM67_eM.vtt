00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.920
We're now going to take a look
at another way to visualize

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.420
the differences between daily
returns of individual stocks.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.698
Let's get back again to
our daily return chart.

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:16.270
We've got S&amp;P 500 here plotted already.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.890
And let's compare that
to another stock xyz.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.430
Now note here that frequently xyz
moves in the same direction as spy,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.320
but it also sometimes moves a little bit
further like in these sections here.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.399
We'll be able to visualize those
differences in a scatterplot.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.740
So on a scatterplot, there are a number
of individual points or dots.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.140
And each one represents something
that happened on a particular day.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.270
So let's look at this particular day.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.120
On this day, spy was positive,
close to +1.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.070
So we'll look at +1 on spy.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.970
And xyz was about +1 as well but
a little bit larger.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.826
So that day would correspond
to a point about there.

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:15.490
Now we look at each day
one by one individually.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.440
And populate all of our dots
based on what happened each day.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.630
Another interesting day
is this one where spy and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.400
xyz were moving in different directions.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.800
So again we had spy in
positive territory, but

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.070
xyz was in negative territory, so that
would represent a dot about like that.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.830
Now if we were to continue this process
for very many days over a long period of

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.080
time, for most stocks a trend appears
which is something like this where you

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.010
can sort of see there's a relationship
here, maybe a linear relationship.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.820
And, however the dots
are somewhat scattered.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.230
They don't form a perfect line.
