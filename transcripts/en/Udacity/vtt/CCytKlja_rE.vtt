00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.670
The first thing we'll do is add functionality to

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.360
create conferences. Here's the Create a Conference page in the

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.930
UI for the web app. Where you see enter the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.190
name, the city, the description. If we were to go

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.030
ahead and enter these values now the conference wouldn't

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.840
get created because this page sends a call to the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.290
Create Conference function. And it's going to be your job to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.300
implement that function but it's not implemented yet. We're going

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.080
to create conference entities in such a way that each

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.000
one has a parent and that parent is a profile of

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.130
the user who created it. The reason for doing this is

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.000
it makes it very easy to quickly find all the conferences

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.550
that are particularly user created. For example, you'll be able to

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.050
very quickly find all the conferences that you created. Now let's

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.530
take a look at the code. So here I have the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.020
class conference. And you'll see that it has this @Parent property.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.020
Using objectify, the way you create an entity with a parent is that you use the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.600
annotation @Parent to annotate one property as the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.900
parent. So in this case, we've annotated profileKey

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.650
as the property that's going to hold the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.180
parent, so profileKey is going to be the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.930
key of the profile entity that's the parent

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.140
of this conference. Now when you created profile

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.740
entities, you specified user ID as a property

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.500
to use as the ID. For conference entities, we

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.960
don't have any specific thing that we can use

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.280
as the key that uniquely identifies the conference. So

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.190
we're going to let App Engine allocate the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.050
key for off. However, using objectify, you still need

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.000
to identify one property as the property to hold

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.360
the ID. So in this case, we're going to use

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.020
the cunningly named property ID and mark it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.070
as @ID. So this is the property that uses

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.890
the ID for the key. If you remember for

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.080
profile entities the ID property was a string and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.640
here for conference it's a long. That's long with

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.010
an L, there's three kinds of types that your

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.900
property annotated by @Id can be. It can be

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.270
a long, capital L long, little L or string

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.650
capital S. So one more annotation that we didn't use

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.870
in the profile class is @Index. You'll notice that some

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.050
of the fields in the conference have this @index annotation

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.390
and what that means is we want to index property.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.940
And the reason we do this is that later on

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.440
we're going to be searching on that property. We're going to be

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.850
searching on the name, for example, we won't be searching

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.440
on the description. So what I'm going to do is just

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.250
quickly scroll through this code and explain what

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.950
it does. We already talked about the @Parent. The

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.930
profile key is the key of the parent

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.440
of this entity, topics, every conference can optionally have

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.190
one or more topics that it's about. For

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.990
example, your conference might be about medical innovations or

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.810
web technologies or maybe it's about both web

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.810
technologies and programming languages. So, this is a multi-valued

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.850
property, it's a list of strings. We have the city,

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.120
we have the start date of the conference, the end

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.040
date. We're also going to keep track of the month

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.130
so that we can issue queries such as show me

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.010
all the conferences in December. So max attendees is the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.220
maximum capacity of the conference. We're also going to have the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.360
seats available, which keeps track of how many seats are

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.200
still available. Obviously at the very beginning, the seats available

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.250
is the same as the capacity but as

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.290
people sign up to attend the conference. The seats

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.619
available is going to go down. For entities in

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.752
general, the default constructor is private and here we

00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:38.626
have the constructor for the conference and what this

00:03:38.626 --> 00:03:41.552
constructor does is it sets the Id to then

00:03:41.552 --> 00:03:44.133
pass to Id and it also figures out the

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:48.330
profile key by calling Key.create on Profile. It also

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.490
figures out the profileKey of the parent profile and sets it and then it

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.410
just sets the organizerUserId and then it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.050
calls this updateWithConferenceForm to set the other

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.674
values in the conference. Here we've got

00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:06.572
some getter method. We get the profileKey

00:04:06.572 --> 00:04:10.310
here. This getWebsafeKey just basically returns a

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.590
string of the conference's key. So that

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.769
it can be passed around through forms and

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.610
through the browser, if necessary. And this one

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.170
here, the getOrganizerDisplayName. The display name's calculated on

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.280
the fly when we need it. Just in

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.910
case the organizer updates their display name. Okay.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.860
Just some more getters, getTopics, we get a

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.690
defensive copy of the list, getCity, you need

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.680
to get the start date, the end date, getMonth

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.230
and so on. The updateWithConferenceForm method takes value

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.710
send in the conference form and update the conference

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.830
entity with those values. For example, here you

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.890
see how we calculate which month conference is occurring

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.630
in and set the value of the month

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.800
field. There's a couple more methods that we'll be

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.770
using later, there's bookSeats so that when the user

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.920
registers to attend the conference, we need to keep

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.470
track of how many seats are available. So we

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.910
decrease the number of seats available by the number booked.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.800
And then give back seats if someone registers for

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.830
a conference and changes their mind and unregisters then we

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.920
need to reset the seats available. And then this

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.350
toString is just a function so that you can get

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.312
a string of the entire conference. Now, we actually

00:05:26.312 --> 00:05:30.030
wrote all the code for conference.java for you. I want

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.590
you to make sure that you take a look and read it and understand it. Now let's

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.440
take a quick look at the ConferenceForm class. Again,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.580
we've written this class for you. This class defines

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.100
the input parameters to the createConference function just like

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.270
ProfileForm defined the input parameters to the function saveProfile.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.350
So basically contains the fields that are going to be

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.560
passed in the form or whatever input method to

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.040
the create conference function. And if you're

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.550
getting worried that we wrote too much

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.830
for you, don't worry, you're going to

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.850
be writing the create conference method yourself
