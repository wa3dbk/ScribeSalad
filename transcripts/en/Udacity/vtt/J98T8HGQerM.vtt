00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, I'd like to ask you about random walks.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
These are really interesting things that show up in everything from finance to physics,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but amazingly they're the exact same thing you learned about when you learned about

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
when you learned how to manipulate normal distributions.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's assume we have some object--it could be me,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
it could be a point, it could be an insect,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it could be a particle in a fluid--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
sitting right here at position 0.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, let's assume that it moves every second in a normally distributed way.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Its movement has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Note that in this case the variance and the standard deviation are actually the same

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
since they're both 1.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What I'd like to ask you is after 1 second tell me what the mean

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and standard deviation of the object's position is.

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please tell me the object's mean position and the variance of that position.
