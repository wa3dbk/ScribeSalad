Since we've helped Athena come to an understanding of what a function is, we

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.860
are going to begin the review of functions with the equation y equals x squared

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.840
minus 1. First, we want you to think about how you would determine whether or

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.637
not this is a function. So consider that for a second, and type what you think

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:21.923
you should do to figure this out in this box.
