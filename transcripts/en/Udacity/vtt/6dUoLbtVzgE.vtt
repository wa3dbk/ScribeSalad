00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.260
Now it's time to put together the background

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.939
technology that I introduced to you, plus some

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.870
more, and describe to you a particular distributor

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.970
file system called XFS which is also built at

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.645
UC Berkeley. XFS builds on the shoulders of

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:19.670
periodic technologies. The first one, the log based

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.450
striping that I just mentioned to you from

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.374
the Zebra file system. And another technology called co-operative

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:31.060
cashing which is also a prior UC Berkley project. And in addition to these two

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.330
technologies, XFS also has introduced several new nuances in order to make

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.450
the distributor file system truly scalable and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.240
get towards what is called serverlessness, or

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.340
in other words, no reliance on a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.640
central server. And those techniques include dynamic

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.640
management of data and metadata. Subsetting of

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.840
the storage servers, and we'll talk about

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.190
all of these techniques in much more detail in the rest of this lecture.
