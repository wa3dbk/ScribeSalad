00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.110
Okay, so here what I mean concretely by not doing this thing

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.980
over here any more. So here what I'm proposing we do now. We

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.170
take all the data, all of the training data we had, the

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.040
xy1, xy2, dot, dot, dot, xyn and we put it in a database

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.027
&gt;&gt; Ah-ha.

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:19.390
&gt;&gt; And then next time we get some new x to look

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.630
at, we just look it up in the database. And we're done.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.980
&gt;&gt; None of this fancy shmancy learning, none of this

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.130
producing an appropriate function like you know, wx+b, or what ever

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.740
the equation of a line is. None of that fancy stuff anymore.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.980
We just stick in to the data base. People written data

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.410
base programs before. We'll look it up when we're done. We're done.Period

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.320
&gt;&gt; I feel like you've changed the paradigm.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.540
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am a paradigm changer. So what do you think?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.790
&gt;&gt; It's like, it's like disruptive. It's going to throw off the markets.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's going to change everything. So, what do you think?

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.260
&gt;&gt; well, I mean, so there's a bunch of

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.490
really cool things about this idea. Which is why

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.200
I'm excited. So one is it, you know, it

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.040
doesn't forget, right? So it actually is very reliable.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.120
It's very ,um ,dependable, right, so if you put in an x, y pair you ask for the

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.160
x you're going to get that y back instead of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.180
some kind, you know, crack potty, smooth version of it.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.930
&gt;&gt; Right, so we don't, yeah that's a good point. So we look at this little

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.600
blue line over here, you'll notice that say,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.960
for this little x over here, we're not going to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.880
get back what we put in, so, it remembers, it's like an elephant. Good.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.860
&gt;&gt; So that's kind of cool. Another thing is that

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.740
there's none of this wasted time, you know, doing learning [LAUGH].

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.890
It just takes the data and it, and it's, very

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.497
rapidly just puts it in the database. So [CROSSTALK] it's fast.

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:36.060
&gt;&gt; It's fast. It's like. I like it when you say nice things

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.900
about my algorithms. Okay. So it's fast. Anything else, you can think of?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.190
&gt;&gt; Sh, yeah I cant think of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.480
one more thing at least.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.075
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:46.890
&gt;&gt; Which is ,that like you, it's simple.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.990
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's true. I am simple. I am simple and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.180
straightforward. I just need a few things to make me happy.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.990
&gt;&gt; Bacon.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.680
&gt;&gt; Bacon, and

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.550
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.040
&gt;&gt; Chocolate.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.160
&gt;&gt; Oh nice.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.930
&gt;&gt; Have you ever had chocolate covered bacon?

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.580
&gt;&gt; That seems wrong.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.030
&gt;&gt; You know, you would think so, but it turns out it's delicious. It's

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.420
like if you take fat, and sugar, and you put it together somehow you like

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.000
it [LAUGH] I'm not making this up you can buy

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.250
chocolate covered bacon, you're unsurprised to here in America. Okay, so

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.930
we've got three good things in remember stuff. So, you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.830
know, none of this little noisy throwing away information. It's very

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.540
fast, you just stick it in a database. Using your

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.020
favorite data base. And looking up is going to be equally as

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.590
fast. And it's very simple. There's really no interesting learning

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.440
going on here. So it's the perfect algorithm when we're done.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.610
&gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, I, it feels

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.900
like there's more that we need to say though.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.250
&gt;&gt; Like what?

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.700
&gt;&gt; In particular the way that you wrote this, F of X equals look up of X. If

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.170
I give you one of the other points in

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.770
between ,then it will return no such point found.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.220
Which means it's really quite conservative. It's not willing

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.510
to go out on a limb and say ,well

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.570
I haven't seen this before but. It ought to

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.880
be around here, instead it just says, I don't know.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.920
&gt;&gt; Mm. So the down side of remembering is, no

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.615
generalization.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:02.650
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I guess a similar sort of issue is that when you, when

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.920
you call it memorization, it makes, it reminds me of the issues that we saw with

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.190
regard to overfitting So, it bottles the noise

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.190
exactly, it bottles exactly what it was given.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.900
So it's going to be very sensitive to noise. So it's kind of a yes and no.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.430
&gt;&gt; So that's a little scary and, and it can over fit in a couple of

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.260
ways, I think it can over fit ,um,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.350
by believing the data too much that is literally

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.930
believing all of it and what do you do if you

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.530
have couple ,uh, speaking in noise, what if you have you know

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.420
a couple of examples that are all the same. I have got

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.608
an x, shows up multiple times but each with a different y.

00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:37.130
&gt;&gt; Oh,the same x,ah, yeah, and so the look up

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.280
would return two different things and this algorithm or whatever

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.590
that you have described so far, wouldn't commit to either

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.260
of them and it would just say, hey, here is both.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that seems problematic.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright. But I feel like,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.650
you know, you are going to to tell me, how

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.560
to fix those things. So I wasn't too worried.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, there is gotta be a nice way

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.220
of fixing it. I think There's sort of a basic problem

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.640
here, which is that we're taking this remembering and then

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.120
looking up a little too literally, right? So I stick in

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.630
the data, and I can get back exactly the data

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.450
that I got, but I can't get back anything that I

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.440
don't have, and that seems like something that we might

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.760
be able to overcome if we're just a little bit clever.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.650
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.200
&gt;&gt; So let's see if we can be a little bit clever.
