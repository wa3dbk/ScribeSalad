00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.250
The answer here is just income level. Gender would not

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.880
be considered an ordered factor, since it doesn't make sense

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.410
to rank male and female groups. The military service and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.550
children variables are binary variables with yes or no values, so

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.560
these really wouldn't make sense to order either. Using the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.040
same thinking, it doesn't really make sense to order the levels

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.580
of country and state variables, since we wouldn't rank those

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.500
either. We wouldn't really say one location is better than another.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.770
And finally, cheese falls into the same bucket as military service and children,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.960
because it's binary, so this one's out too. The income levels actually have

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.230
a natural order to them where we can group the buckets from lowest

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.460
to highest, or from highest to lowest. That's what make it an ordered factor.
