00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.660
In order to rationalize this denominator, we want our powers of 2, x and y to

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.243
be divisible by 3. This means, we'll going to to have 2 cubed, x to the 6th,

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:13.901
and y to the 9th. We need to up these powers, so that way they're divisible by

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:18.558
3. So, to change 2 to the 1 to 2 to the 3, we multiply by a cube root of 2

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:23.755
squared. This means, we have to multiply by the cube root of 2 squared x to the

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:29.850
1 y squared. This is so that way the powers sum to multiples of 3. We'll 2 to

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.373
the 1 and 2 squared, which is 2 to the 3rd. x to the 5th and x to the 1, which

00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:39.664
is x to the 6th. And y to the 7th times y squared, which y to the 9th. Since we

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.992
multiply a denominator by this expression, we multiply our numerator by the

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:47.538
same expression. Now, we want to simplify. Our numerator stays the same, since

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:52.200
we can't pull out any of these factors, since they don't appear three times.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.302
This denominator simplifies to 2 x squared and y to the 3rd. Remember, we're

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:02.945
just applying power divided by root to get each of these powers. And we can

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:08.577
actually simplify further. The 6 and the 2 reduce to 3 divided by 1. And this

00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:12.976
power of x reduces with 1 of the powers in the denominator. In other words,

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:15.726
we'll have 1 more power of x in the denominator, than we would in our

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:20.380
numerator. This leaves us with our simplified answer. Now, the hardest part to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.108
this problem is understanding what to multiply by here. I think if you start by

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:27.321
figuring out what your denominator should look like, you'll get there more

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.753
quickly.
