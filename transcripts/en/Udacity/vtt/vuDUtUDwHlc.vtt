00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.788
Here the correct answer is. Did you get them right? If so nice work. I know this

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:09.278
last one is little bit tricky. So don't worry if you didn't get all of these

00:00:09.278 --> 00:00:14.879
right. For the first one we would have 6 7ths times 6 7ths or 6 squared over 7

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.684
squared. So 36 over 49. For the next one I would have negative 3 squared and 4

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:27.722
squared. So 9 divided by 16. And finally, for this last one, I have x divided by

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:33.546
4 raised to the 0 power. Remember, any non-zero base raised to the 0 power is

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:34.330
simply 1.
