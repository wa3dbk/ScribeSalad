00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.750
If we plug in 0 as our input we get 7 times 5 times 0 which is just 0. So if the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.334
cut side is 0, the volume of the box will be 0. This makes sense because there

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:13.682
will be no flaps to fold up since there would have been nothing cut out of the

00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:16.994
original rectangle. You won't be able to make a box at all and it definitely

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:20.795
wouldn't be able to hold anything. So it makes sense that the volume of that

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:26.815
would be 0. Plugging in 2 to this equation gives us v of 2 equals 6. Plugging 3

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:32.531
in gives us for the volume of negative 3. And last but not least, if we plug in

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:36.133
4 for x, we end up with a volume of 12 cubic inches.
