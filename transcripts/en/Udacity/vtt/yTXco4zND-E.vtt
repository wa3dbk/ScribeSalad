00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.960
There is a whole lot to
know about Android testing.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.400
Honestly, we could, and

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.610
probably should, make an entire
course on how to do it well.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.720
Let's just look into
how to run tests and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.540
when to use unit tests
versus connected tests.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.150
We've defined a super simple
project with this class Echo.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.560
It has a method that just returns
whatever you put into it.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.360
It also has another version
of Echo where it first

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.780
logs whatever you input and
then returns it.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.716
We've also added a product
flavor to this project.

00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:36.240
In the paid folder, we've got
paid Echo which does essentially

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.030
the same thing but for
collections instead of single objects.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.980
So we have this collection echo that
echos back whatever you put in.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.040
And then this version of echo that
first logs each item that you put in.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.930
So, we have defined some
tests in the test directory.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.430
These are JUnit tests and so we just
verify that echo is in fact behaving how

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.730
we expect and that the logging version
of echo is behaving how we expect.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.790
To test the paid flavor,
in the testPaid folder,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.810
we have another pair of
extremely simple JUnit tests

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.060
that just verify that the echo of
the collection works as expected.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.190
And that the echoing of the collection
with logging works as expected.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.060
All of this code is in
the course repository, so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.770
you can get a closer look there.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.530
If we open up the Gradle pane,
and run the check task.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.315
Let's see what happens
when we run these tests.

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:28.870
Uh-oh, we have failing tests.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.250
We can check out the report at this
file path to see what went wrong.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.420
So here we are at app&gt; build &gt; reports
&gt; tests &gt; freeDebug &gt; Index.html.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.810
And here's our report
of what went wrong.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.020
Let's see Method i in
android.util.log not mocked.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.010
So I think I know what's
going wrong here.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.680
We tried to use the Android
logger from a unit test.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.730
Now, the Android framework doesn't exist
when we're running unit tests since

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.840
those are being run
on the local machine.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.260
If we want to test something that
is accessing the Android framework,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.730
we have to run those on the device.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.670
Let's move those into connected
tests instead of unit tests.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.709
So we'll comment out the tests that
require the Android framework,

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.035
comment this one out too, and

00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:17.425
now we'll added our connected to
test to the Android test directory.

00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:22.235
Note that this is an Android test
case now instead of a JUnit test, and

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:26.860
we can add our paid tests to
the Android test paid directory.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.010
Now if we open up the Gradle pane, and
run connected check, and there we go.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.820
The tests that require accessing
the Android framework will run

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.310
on the device, where the Android
framework is available.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.180
And they all pass.
