00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
An optional piece of software is something called launchpad central at www.launchpadcentral.com.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The launchpad central allows you to share your work, your customer discovery narrative,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what's you're doing outside the building with mentors and instructors and everybody else.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Some of you might think, "Well, I don't want to share what I'm doing," but it's not sharing your IP

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or your great ideas--it's actually sharing what you found out in testing your hypothesis

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and it allows others to comment in real time.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So in fact, you won't have to sit alone thinking about "Am I on the right path

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or is this the right strategy, etc."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The launchpad central comes with the startup weekend program,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which are available to anybody else here at launchpadcentral.com.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It is not required for this class but is a great resource if you're interested.
