00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:05.220
A hash function basically as we said,
the input is a password, this box is

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.280
the hash function, whatever computation
goes on here is going to happen here.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.790
And the output, this password could be
any length, could be a past phrase that

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.640
combines a bunch of words,
letters, digits, whatever it is.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.290
But it produces the hash
value is of a fixed length.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.200
In this direction we said,
it's one way so it's easy to go.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.460
It's easy to compute this
function given this input and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.870
for us to produce this output.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.260
If it just had this and wanted to invert
it going the other direction that's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.910
going to be really hard, which is the
basis of which we're talking about here.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.639
Given that we're going to derive
something from a password using

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:45.725
a hash function and store that,
let's talk about a couple of threats.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:49.579
because of the security mindset we have,
anytime we sort of make a decision,

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.710
we want to think about its
security implications.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.150
So what are some threats?

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.470
We are going to assume that the one-way
property of the hash functions holds.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.020
You make some assumptions so
we are going to assume that inwarding or

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.390
going the other direction from
hash value to a password,

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210
we're not going to worry about that.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.200
Let's say we're talking
about common passwords.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.710
You know that password is a common
password, or one, two, three,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.090
four, five is a common password,
but this hash function is known.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.950
This one-way hash function we're talking
about, we're not doing security,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.590
web security, so it's known.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.760
We can compute the hash values
off the common passwords.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.500
And we're saying these hash
values are stored by the system,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260
those are the derived values.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.480
If you can get hold of the hash values
the system has and if you can find

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.280
the hash values for the common passwords
among those stored values, it's not hard

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.823
to see how we can find out passwords
of certain users in the system.

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:49.620
So if the hash value of 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.270
5 matches with the stored value, we know
that user's password is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.810
The other kind of attacks we can mount,
one is called a dictionary attack.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.180
So it's like a dictionary
has lots of words and

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.220
think about a long list of passwords,
a dictionary of possible passwords.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.030
Words and maybe they're mutated in
a certain way, you add a few digits or

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.660
something like that, but you have
this called space of passwords or

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.490
the dictionary of passwords, and you can
try to brute force each one of them.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.010
That's called a dictionary attack.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.390
An offline attack is one where we're
not interacting with the system.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.000
We're not trying to log in each time,
we try a different password.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.710
If you do that, then you are, that's
called an online attempt we are making.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.750
We are interacting with the system so
when you do an online, sort of guessing

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.690
attack, the system can stop you
after a certain number of tries.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.870
It locks you out.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.900
So, to avoid that problem we can
sort of offline in our free time,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.230
we can take the hash values,
take a dictionary and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.210
sort of compute for each dictionary
word the hash value and search for

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.810
that in the set of hash
values that we have.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.290
When we find a match
we know our password.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.110
And we can do this as I said
without interacting the system.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.000
We interact with the system only
when we discover a correct password.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.300
So those are called offline attacks and
dictionary attacks,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.390
sort of brute force attacks.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.790
So one thing even when
we store derive values

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.750
in particular hash values here these
kind of attacks are always possible.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.550
Common passwords, the hash value,
dictionary or offline attacks.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.700
The assumption here is that the attacker
does have access to the hash values.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.440
And the hash values don't
immediately allow him or

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.240
her to find out the password.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.910
They can try different, or try to
guess the passwords that match and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.700
when they run into a match for
the hash value then they know for

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.390
sure that this is the password.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.300
So these are the kind of attacks
that are possible even when you

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.700
only store hash values.
