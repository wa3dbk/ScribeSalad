00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.260
Congratulations on making it this far in the class.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.200
These next series of videos will cover two important topics,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.370
interaction and animation.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.700
I'll be showing you specific examples of how these ideas are played out in

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.850
narrative structures overall.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.700
&gt;&gt; You'll see how D3 enables you to add both animation and

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.980
interaction to your visualizations.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.150
And we'll really push the boundaries of what's possible by using

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.570
geographic features to create a map with D3.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.530
&gt;&gt; But first, let's go through a few examples of how others have

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.150
used interaction to add additional depth to their visualizations, and

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.350
also tell a compelling narrative.
