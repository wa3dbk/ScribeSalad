00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.596
So here's the answers. That a dynamic language will require less code. And there

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:07.470
are two reasons for that. One is because you don't need all the type

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.515
declarations. The other is code can be more versatile, in our python code we can

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:15.734
write a double procedure that works on both numbers and strings. Probably a bad

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.862
idea, but we can do it. With a statically typed language like Java, there's no

00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:22.790
way to do that. You've got to write different procedures if you want them to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.395
work on different types. A static language would be less likely for programs to

00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:30.091
crash and the reason for that is because you find your bugs earlier. You find

00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:33.642
them when you compile the program before their program is running, at least some

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:38.122
of the bugs. The more fun is a fairly subjective question. I'm going to go with

00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:41.834
dynamic as more fun and it's more fun 'cause usually get things to happen more

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:45.928
quickly. It requires less effort to get a program working and behaving, pretty

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:49.216
close to correct. If it's a static language you have to get you program a lot

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.180
closer to correct before you can start playing with it. It's also easier to make

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.897
changes in a dynamic language. Other people might disagree and one problem with

00:00:56.897 --> 00:01:00.431
that dynamic language, when all is going well, you can be nice and happy, if

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:04.193
things start to break with a dynamic language, you might have a much harder time

00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:08.238
figuring out what's wrong than you would with a static language. But I'll stick

00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:12.926
with my dynamic answer and I hope you enjoy Paranian Python. Which is a

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:17.242
dynamically typed language. Programs should execute faster, if they're written

00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:21.531
as statically typed language. This depends a lot on the language. And the tools

00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:25.130
that are used to do this and there's been a lot of improvements in making

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.420
dynamically typed languages run fast. But the execution tools have an advantage

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.337
in a statically typed language. There's less that they have to determine at run

00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:36.535
time, and there's more they can do in advance. So they should still always be

00:01:36.535 --> 00:01:41.653
able to run fast. Finally, which one is better for programming avionics? Well,

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:45.488
you really don't want to discover your type errors when you're at 30,000 feet,

00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:49.505
much better to discover them before you take off. So there, static languages

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:50.683
have a big advantage.
