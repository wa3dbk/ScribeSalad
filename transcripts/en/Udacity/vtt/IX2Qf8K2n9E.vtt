00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.270
The couple of other techniques.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.780
In fact the next one we're going to
talked about is hardly used.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.590
A number of operating systems now and so
one thing that's going to be different

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.680
about the next two techniques we'll
talked about is that they going to use.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.280
Support from the operating
system/hardware that we have

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.590
to deal with buffer overflow or
to thwart buffer overflow attacks.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.450
So the first one, as which I
said many operating systems use,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.370
is what is called
Address Space Layout Randomization.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.360
ASLR.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.370
So remember,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.280
in an address space, some place stack
is space where stack is allocated.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.820
So, stack starts at certain place.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.410
Somewhere the library code goes, another
place where the heap goes, and so on.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.180
What if we randomize the places
where these areas of memory start.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.140
Remember that hacker had to actually
guess where key information is.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.790
So if I wanted to do return to libc
attack, I had to know where the library

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.400
is, where a certain function may be, so
I know the address of that function.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.700
And I can use that as I overflow the
return address field in the stack frame.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.900
So, I need to know these address.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.390
And what ASLR does, it makes hard,
because of the randomization that we do,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.070
it makes hard for the attacker to
find these important locations.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.270
Where the address that
the attacker is interested in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.170
is going to over the information,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.690
address of the information that that
hacker is interested in is not know.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.240
So as I said.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.805
A number of operating systems
these days actually do that to

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:38.870
protect the programs and processes from
these buffer overflow kind of attacks.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.720
So this just makes it harder for the
hacker to successfully craft an attack

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.870
where can return, or manage, or direct
control of the program to the certain

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.580
known place that could be used to let
the attacker execute arbitrary code.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.695
This one other defense against
stack buffer overflow.

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:03.345
When the shell code itself
is stored on the stack.

00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:08.365
So remember if I don't do return
to libc then my return address has

00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:13.795
to point me to some place where
the shell code lives, or is stored, and

00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:19.485
you could write that shell code
into some area of the stack itself.

00:02:19.485 --> 00:02:21.920
And then you can execute off the stack.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.520
There's no legitimate reason for

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.860
us to execute instructions
that are stored on the stack.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.970
So one thing we can do is we can
make the stack non executable.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.950
Basically says the system is
not going to allow you to fetch

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.040
instructions from the stack area or
the stack segment.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.780
If you do that then you
can't execute on the stack.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.430
So your shell code
cannot be on the stack.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.680
You have to find some other place to put
your shell code and maybe that's why you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.100
have to try tricks, like return
to libc and things like that.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.830
And use a library function
to transfer control to

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.090
the code that attacker ones executed.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.330
So here I guess we talked about sort
of security is increasing assurance.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.800
Making the attacker's
job more difficult.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.430
And making the legitimate, in this
case here we're talking programmers,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.880
their task somewhat easier.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.180
So ASLR obviously is making
the attackers job more difficult because

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.280
key addresses that they need to know,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.740
they don't know exactly where
they are in the address space.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.630
And they can't put code on the stack and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.340
hope to get it executed because we have
the hardware operating system says

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.230
not supposed to fetch instructions from
the stack area of the address space.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.200
So these are techniques for
actually dealing with buffer overflows.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.180
As we said, one makes it harder for
the attacker, by making it difficult for

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.587
him to find the right addresses, or be
able to use the stack flow shell code.
