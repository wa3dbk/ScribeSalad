00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.630
Let's look at the histograms of f0 and f1, and f0 and f2 again.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.260
Let's switch to the iPython notebook quickly.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.312
Here we are looking at two histograms of f0 and f2.

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:20.545
The f0 is the average submitted charge amount shown in green,

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:26.510
and f2 is the average Medicare allowed amount shown in blue.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.740
Notice the shape of the two histograms are quite different.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:39.000
Moreover, the value ranges for f0 and f2 are also quite different.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.740
Similarly, you can look at the histogram of f0 which is, again, in green.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.520
And f1, which is the Medicare payment amounts, given in red.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.950
Here also you see a difference in shape, and range of the histograms.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.430
To compare two histograms in the same range, we can scale the variables.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.890
To scale variables, we can subtract the minimum value of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.260
the variable from each of those valleys of the variables.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.880
And divide by the range of the variable which is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.640
the maximum value minus the minimum value.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.328
Let's now use this formula to scale each of our variables, and

00:01:22.328 --> 00:01:25.190
re-plot our histograms.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.480
Upon running, you will get something like this.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.850
It is very hard to see here.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.560
So in the next histogram we will make this into a logarithmic scale.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.540
To change the y scale to logarithmic, we have changed log equals 1 in the code.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.760
Let's run this part of the code.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.010
You should now have a histogram that looks like this.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.200
This is the histogram of f0 and f2 plotted in a logarithmic scale.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.570
Also notice the range and the x, or the horizontal axis.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.000
The range of the scaled variables are between 0 and 1.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.889
Of course be careful, such that you don't have only one data point,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.280
in which case you will get 0 for the denominator because your max and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.650
min values will be equal.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.860
Scaling the variables makes them computationally easier to deal with,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.890
and easier to visualize.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.805
Now we are going to look at correlations between two variables, but before we do

00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:36.738
so, let's look at where we are in our questioning and model-building phase.

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:55.140
So far, we have inspected the various variables of interest in the data.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.400
We have looked at the allowed amount, charged amount and the payment amounts.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.200
Now we will ask the correlations.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.640
In asking if the variables are correlated,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.530
we can ask if the correlation in non-linear, or if the correlation is linear.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.570
We can inspect this by looking at a scatter diagram of the variables.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:28.471
Let us now inspect the scattered diagram of the two variables f1 and f2.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.930
Notice that we have plotted both the variables after scaling them.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.180
Once you are done, you should have a graph that looks very much like this.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.030
The scatter plot of these two variables are very linear.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.000
What we can conclude from that,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.450
is that the paid amounts are directly proportional to the allowed amounts.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.180
Similarly we can look at the scatter plot of f0 and f1.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.570
In this case, although we have some correlation,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.050
it is not as linear as it is between f1 and f2.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.990
We want to have a quantitative measurement of the correlation between

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.570
two variables.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.220
We have already observed from the scatter plot of f1 and f2,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.840
that they're linearly correlated.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.930
We can calculate what is called the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.030
Let's first define this quantity.
