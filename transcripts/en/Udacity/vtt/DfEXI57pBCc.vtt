00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.035
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You might be wondering, why should we even learn elimination to begin with?

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.170
Well, would substitution really work here? Would it be a good choice? Well, I

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.418
could take this first equation and try and solve it for either x or y. Remember,

00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:16.450
for substitution we're trying to get one of the variables alone on one side of

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.821
the equation. I'm going to solve this equation for x. I subtract 3y from both

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:25.009
sides to get 2x is equal to negative 3y minus 15. I just list these terms,

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.199
because they're not like. Then we divide both sides by 2, so x is equal to

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.493
negative 3 halves y minus 15 halves. Notice that this equation is a little

00:00:33.493 --> 00:00:38.020
complicated. We have two negative signs, and we also have fractions. So when

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.790
we're working with substitution, this could make our work more difficult. Keep

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.445
in mind though, that when we perform substitution, we don't have to just solve

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:53.787
for x. We could have solved this equation for y. I could subtract 2x from both

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:59.095
sides, to get 3y equals negative 2x plus 15. Then I would divide each term by 3.

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:03.178
So, 1y would equal negative 2 3rds x plus 5. If I wanted to use this for

00:01:03.178 --> 00:01:07.538
substitution, it's still pretty complicated. We have a fraction and we have a

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:12.049
negative sign. So let's try instead using elimination. When solving this system

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.045
using elimination, I'm going to try and eliminate these x variables. I could

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:20.279
choose to try and eliminate the y variables. It doesn't actually matter. I'm

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:25.090
going to multiply this first equation by 5. So I get 5 times 2x, which is 10x, 5

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.039
times 3y, which is 15y, and 5 times negative 15, which is negative 75. I

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.329
multiply this equation by 5, so that way I could get a 10x here. So what number

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.226
should we multiply this 5x by, so that way we get a number here that would

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:44.190
eliminate with the 10x? Take some time to think about it.
