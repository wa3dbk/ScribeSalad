00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.838
Okay just a couple of helpful tips, to reiterate the one

00:00:02.838 --> 00:00:06.078
I just gave you before is, always automatically escape variables when

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:08.990
possible. Not every template language will allow you to do so,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.590
but always give it a look. Jinja certainly allows you do to

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.230
so. So in this class you should definitely do that. Next

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.140
is, minimize the code that you include in templates. What I've showed

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.740
you so far is statements and foreloops. That's about it. Jinja

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.700
will allow you to put almost, like arbitrary Python into your templates.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.820
But, you remember the whole reason we're using templates

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.480
in the first place is, so we don't have to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.570
have HTML in our code, likewise we don't have code

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.560
in our HTML. Because it makes it very difficult to,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.980
to modify, to edit, to debug, all those things.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.090
It's a total pain. So, and of course, the inverse

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.520
of this is minimize your HTML in code. I generally,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.940
I have a rule generally, where we have zero HTML

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.360
in our code. Even if it's a little one-line thing,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.730
we put it in a template. That way all your HTML

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.340
is in one place, all your code is in one place,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.810
and you don't, your not using the wrong tool for the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.910
job. Which inevitably will bite you down the road as

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.950
your projects get more complex. Those are just some things you

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.060
know, these aren't hard and fast rules but these are things

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.850
that I've found that have served me well over the years.
