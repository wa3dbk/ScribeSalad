00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.575
There are several different situations in which we might see equal signs. The

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:09.565
last case you did had an example of a conditional equation in it. Conditional

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:14.175
equations are true for some values of the variable, but not all. So, like we saw

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:18.320
earlier, this left side of the equation will be equal to the right side,

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:23.053
depending on what we plug in for n. Some numbers will work, but some will not.

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:27.967
Some things with equal signs will be identities. In an identity, no matter what

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:32.546
number you plug in for the variable, you will get a true equation. The third

00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:37.033
case is that we might see an equal sign in something that is not actually an

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:41.838
equation. You've seen a few of these before. No matter what number I plug in for

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.060
y, over in this equation, I will never be able to make the left side equal to

00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:49.890
the right side. We'll talk more soon about the situations in which these

00:00:49.902 --> 00:00:54.060
different types of equations are used or at least, where these top two are used.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:57.998
The last one is usually something that comes up if a mistake has been made

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.698
somewhere in our math.
