00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.020
Let's suppose that we have a TCP sender that's

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.590
sending packets, where the sending rate is controlled by

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.520
the window W, and it's receiving ACKs. Now at

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.870
any time if the window's W, only W unacknowledged

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.590
packets may be outstanding. So the sender's sending rate,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.140
R, is simply the TCP window, W, divided by

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.040
the round trip time of the path. So the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.310
rate is W over RTT. Now remember that TCP uses

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.260
additive increase, multiplicative decrease, or AIMD, congestion control.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.810
So for every W ACKs received, we send W

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.080
plus one packets, and our TCP sawtooth will look

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.510
something like this. We'll start at a rate W

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.330
max over 2, increase the window to W max and then when we see a drop we

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.660
will apply multiplicative decrease and reduce the sender's sending

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.430
rate to W max over 2 again. So here,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.100
right at the point of a packet drop, this represents

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.190
the maximum number of packets that can be in flight. So

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.190
again, the required buffer is the maximum number of packets

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.350
that can be in flight, or simply the height of this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.230
TCP sawtooth. Now we know the rate is W over

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.860
RTT, and we'd like the sender to send at a common

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.050
rate, R. And if we'd like the sender to be sending

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.910
at the same rate before and after it experiences a loss,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.850
then we know that the rate before the drop must

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.470
equal the rate after the drop. So then we can set

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.890
these two rates equal. We know that the RTT is part

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.130
transmission delay T, and part queuing delay which is the maximum

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.310
buffer size of the bottleneck link, divided by the capacity

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.150
of the bottleneck link. We also know that after reducing the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.790
window, the queuing delay is zero. So we can replace the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.020
term on the left with W old over 2T plus B

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.150
over C and we can replace the term on

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.020
the right with W old over 2, because the congestion

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.700
window has been reduced half divided by 2T. Simply the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.160
propagation delay with no queuing delay. Now if we solve

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.200
this equation we find that the required buffering is simply

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.050
2T times C. Now the rule of thumb makes sense

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.215
for a single flow, but a router in a typical

00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:06.120
backbone network has more than 20,000 flows. And it turns

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.300
out that this rule of thumb only really holds

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.800
if all of the those 20,000 flows are perfectly synchronized.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.680
If the flows are desynchronized, then it turns out

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.310
that this router can get away, with much less buffering.
