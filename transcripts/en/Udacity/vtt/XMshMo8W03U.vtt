00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.240
Now let's look at the code for getting an entity

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.130
out of the datastore. Since you know the key for a

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.560
profile entity, as Mark has explained, you can use the

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.140
key to easily yank the, the entity out of the datastore.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.760
You've already learned how to save entities and how to

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.800
view them in the admin console. The obvious next step is

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.170
to extend the conference center application to get the profile entities

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.920
back out of the datastore. With objectify, you use the ofy.load

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.960
function to load an entity. You can get an

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.170
entity by key or you can query for entities

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.810
that match search criteria. You'll be learning how to

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.000
retrieve entities by key first. Then in the next lesson

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.412
you'll learn how to query for entities that satisfy

00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:41.930
certain criteria. Let's take a look at the code

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.540
to get an entity out of the data store.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.820
Ofy gets the objectify service. Load, loads the entity. Key,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.750
is the key of the entity to load. And

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.460
now means, do it now, don't wait, in other words,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.500
do it synchronously. That's all well and good, but

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.690
how do you get the key? You need to know

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870
the unique ID that was used to generate the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.580
key. Remember how you used the [UNKNOWN] annotation to identify

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.240
user ID as the ID when creating a profile entity.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.200
The ID is used to generate the key. The ID

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.490
isn't the key by itself but its essential to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.580
generating the key. So, for any user who's logged in,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.230
your app can retrieve the user ID, which means you

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.400
can generate the key and consequently get the profile entity

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.660
directly from the datastore. As you've already learned, the user

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.640
is parsed in the call to the end points method

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.110
and you can simply get the user ID like this,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.940
getUserId. To get a key, you call the create method

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.310
on the key class and you need to specify the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.210
kind of entity that you want to retrieve. Here entity's actually

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.420
a variable, so let's say we were creating a key

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.120
for recipe, this would be recipe.class. Then you need to pass

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.270
the ID that was used to generate the key, in

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.250
this case we're using user ID. So now we know the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.120
ID and we know the key, we can get the entity

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.120
from the data store using the key. Now it's your turn

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.150
to work on your conference central app.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.200
You need to complete the getProfile method by

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.820
filling in the TODO to load and return

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.310
the profile entity. You'll need to get the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.680
userID, you'll need to create the key, and you get the profile, and then you

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.010
return the profile. When you've implemented getProfile, you

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.020
can try it out in the APIs Explorer
