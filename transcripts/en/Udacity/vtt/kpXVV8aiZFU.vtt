00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.610
So the answer, is yes, we have a good recursive

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.689
definition, no matter what we pass in for t and

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.410
p, we'll eventually get a result, and the reason for

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.717
that is because every time we do a recursive call, the

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:15.650
value that's passed in for t, is one less than

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.730
the previous value, and eventually, if we start with an integer.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.840
And we keep reducing it, eventually we're going to get to

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.540
the case where t is equal to 0, and then we

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.210
have a base case. We can return the value one, without using the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.450
popularity function again. So this is

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.650
a good recursive definition. It will always

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.290
produce a result. It might not produce a meaningful measure of popularity, but

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.810
if this is how we define popularity, this code will always produce a result.
