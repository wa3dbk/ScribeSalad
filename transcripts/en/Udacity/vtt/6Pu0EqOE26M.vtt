00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.160
In this case, we're checking to see that

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.700
the line has six fields. If it doesn't, we'll

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.720
ignore that line. Another good thing to do would

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.510
be to check that the cost is actually a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.460
number. Assuming that line is okay, we'll simply

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.950
write out our intermediate data in the form of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.420
a key, then a tab, then a value. And

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.520
we'll loop back around and do the next line.
