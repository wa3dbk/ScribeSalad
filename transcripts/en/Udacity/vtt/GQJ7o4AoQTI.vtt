00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.740
If you don't take any special steps,

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.960
most new objects that you create will delegate to the Object prototype, but

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.260
some of the special objects that you can make in JavaScript have

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.640
extra features above and beyond the basic characteristics of all objects.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.000
Arrays, for example, have methods like .indexOf and .slice.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.770
Those array methods are stored in another prototype called the Array prototype.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.700
Since arrays behave a little differently from objects, the Array prototype even

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.390
has its own version of some of the standard methods like toString.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.080
The Array prototype in turn delegates to the Object prototype so that

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.560
the non-unique parts of an array can be inherited from the Object prototype.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.190
And not every single method will need to be

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.680
reimplemented here on the Array prototype.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.630
Notice that the Array prototype and Object prototype both have

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.600
dot constructor properties even though one delegates to the other.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.005
So what do you expect to happen when you query an array for

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:56.620
its dot constructor property?
