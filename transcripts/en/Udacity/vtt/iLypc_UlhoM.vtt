00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.349
So what did we learn from the last quiz? Well we've seen that volume of our box

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:09.394
changes depending on how big the square that we cut out of each corner was. So

00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:13.822
that means that volume in this case is a function of square size. That's pretty

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:18.383
cool. Now for Athena, we're going to have a little project. I want us to figure

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:21.746
out how to maximize the volume of a box that we can make out of a sheet of

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:26.558
paper this size. The same size we've been using which is 5 inches long by 7

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:30.562
inches wide. But in order to do that we're going to have to start by learning a

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:32.933
little bit more about volume.
