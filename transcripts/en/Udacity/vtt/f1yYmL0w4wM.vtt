00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.040
We spent a good amount of time playing
with what are known as line breakpoints.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.780
We created these by clicking
in the gutter on the line of

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.860
code where we wanted to pause
the execution of our application.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.590
But Xcode gives us options to
create other types of useful

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.260
breakpoints that are not associated with
any single, particular line of code.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.350
To create them, we'll need to
go to the break point navigator.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.770
And I'll remove this breakpoint for now.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.900
And then we'll want to focus our
attention on this plus sign in the lower

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.380
left hand corner.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.689
If we click it, a context menu appears,
allowing us to add exception

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.796
breakpoints, open GLES breakpoints,
symbolic breakpoints.

00:00:35.796 --> 00:00:37.850
And a test failure breakpoint.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.120
In this course we're going to
focus on only the exception and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.190
symbolic breakpoints.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.840
Because the other two, open GL and test
failure, are more specialized cases.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.890
So let's add an exception breakpoint and
see what happens.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.720
The first that we can see is that Xcode
creates a breakpoint that does not

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.330
belong to any single file and
it reads all exceptions.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.150
To show the difference I'll
set a line breakpoint.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.820
You can see how this one belongs
to a file and this one does not.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.790
So like it sounds, this breakpoint can
be triggered by any and all exceptions.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.670
If we right click and
edit this breakpoint,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.880
we can see that the break
option is set to on throw.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.980
Thus, anytime the run time
environment throws an exception,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.830
this breakpoint will be hit.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.370
We could change this to on catch but
let's leave this setting for now.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.850
To demonstrate how this breakpoint's
used I'll go to the breakpoint bug

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.210
view controller.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.960
Scroll up to the viewDidLoad and
we'll change the action for

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.160
the singleTapRecognizer
from handleSingleTap

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.510
to hangleSingleTaps with an S because we
know that that method does not exist.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.850
And this will force
an exception to be thrown.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.020
So let's run the application.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.850
We'll tap in the breakpoint
debugging scene.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.240
So once I've tapped the screen,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.920
we can see that our
breakpoint is being reached.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.900
And it's saying that an unrecognized
selector is being sent to the instance

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.070
of a memory address for
a breakpoint bug view controller.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.788
And if I try to continue,
then our application will crash.

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:13.490
And it's terminating on a uncaught
exception of NS exception type.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.800
So let's go ahead and
look at the other options we have.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.140
Let's stop for the exception breakpoint.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.483
So the only thing that's different,
besides the action and options,

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:25.620
which we've seen before,
is this exception option.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.887
And we can set it for a particular
language, like objective C and C++, so

00:02:29.887 --> 00:02:34.270
that we only fire on exceptions
triggered in either language.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.270
And that's really it for
exception breakpoints.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.110
You may be wondering to yourself, well,
how is a exception breakpoint useful?

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.910
This type of breakpoint can be
extremely useful if your application is

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.310
crashing on a particular line of code.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.040
But Xcode and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.990
the stack trace really just aren't
giving you a whole lot of information.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.030
So with an exception breakpoint, you
can pause right before the app crashes,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.795
because say it's not
handling the exception.

00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:00.120
And then determine who is
the culprit of the crash.
