00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.240
So what do we have so far? We have three abstract classes without abstract

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.820
methods in them. We've defined three classes for the Mark IV. But we still have

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.910
to fill in the details of those particular operations. We want to do this in

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.580
a way that we don't compromise our abstraction. What Martin says about this is

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.700
that none of the three classes we have created must never know anything about

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.590
the Mark IV. That is, none of the three abstract classes. This is the depen,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.700
Dependency Inversion Principle. We are not going to allow the high-level coffee

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.900
making policy of this system to depend upon the low-level implementation.
