00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.650
So let's recap what we've talked about today. We started off today by

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.590
talking about one of the most important concepts in all of knowledge based AI,

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.510
which are knowledge based representations. As we go forward in this class,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.780
we'll see knowledge representations are really at the heart of nearly everything

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.610
we'll do. We then talked about semantic networks, which are a good particular

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.270
kind of [UNKNOWN] representation and we used those to talk about the different

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.210
criteria for a good knowledge representation. What do good knowledge

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.260
representations enable us to do and what to they help us avoid? We then talked

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.400
about kind of an abstract class of problem solving methods called Represent and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.170
Reason. Represent and reason really lies under all of knowledge based AI and

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.020
it's a way of representing knowledge and then reasoning over it.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.940
We then talked a little bit about augmenting that with weight, which allows us

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.290
to come to more nuanced and specific conclusions. In the next couple weeks, we

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.020
are going to use these semantic networks to talk about a few different problem

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.770
solving methods. Next time, we'll talk about generating tests and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.410
then we'll move on to a couple slightly different ones called Means and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.940
Analysis and Proper Reduction.
