00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I'm going to introduce a cipher called the One-Time Pad,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and this is actually a perfect cipher,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and we'll define more precisely what that means,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but it's a cipher that reveals no information at all about the key or the message,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and it's actually the only one.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And--you might be wondering--well, if we're starting right at the beginning of the class

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
with a perfect cipher, what's there left to do?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's perfect, but it's very impractical.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the reason it's very impractical is because it requires huge keys.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So to understand the One-Time Pad, the first thing we need to understand

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is the XOR function--which is a name for the exclusive or--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and it's often written as a plus with a circle around it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The truth table for XOR is this:

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the value of A XOR B is true if one of A or B--but only one of them--is true.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So that's why we end up with this truth table.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
XOR has lots of useful properties that make it the favorite function of every cryptographer,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and I'll see if you can figure out one of these on your own.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So the question is: for any values X and Y,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what is the value of x XOR y XOR x?

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So here are your choices: 0, x, y, or it depends on x.
