00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.580
This middle choice, f of x equals x plus 1 times x minus 2 times x plus 5 times

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.978
x minus 4, is the only one that could be the factorization of this polynomial.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:16.332
Remember that all the constants we have in our original factors must multiply

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:22.640
to equal this constant out here, 40. We can double check that 1 times negative

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.100
2 times 5 times negative 4 does in fact equal 40. That's not the case for

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.159
either of these.
