00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.010
Hi everybody welcome to another edition of
the hangout on air for Front-End Nanodegree.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.620
Today i'm joined with Mike Wales and
I'm Jonathan Mavroudis.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.320
Today we're going to talk about
project three which Mike Wales

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.200
actually put together for everybody.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.100
And we hope you can enjoying it so far.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.740
We wanted to talk a little bit
about like our expectations.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.045
And sort of what the minimum
requirements for the project are.

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:26.830
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.080
&gt;&gt; So as you can see here
when we load up the game.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.690
We have our little player character.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.170
Starting in the middle of the grass and
he can realistically start anywhere.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.290
&gt;&gt; He can start anywhere, yeah.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.990
So the minimum requirements
we usually ask for

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.600
is first of all that the little
guy can move around.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.090
This is using the direction keys.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.320
And that functionality's
pretty much already built in.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.010
The key handling is already put in.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.660
You just have to, kind of watch, for

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.840
the key handling and
adjust the data of your player.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.630
So that whenever it draws,
it draws in a new position.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.925
There are player should be sort
of confined in that window.

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:03.870
Right.
So if I kind of move my player.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.019
I can't go any further right
even though I'm mashing right,

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:07.510
I can't go any further left.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.530
Even though I'm mashing left and
if he happens to fall off the window.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.660
Then he's kind of not on the game.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.810
Right.
So, we want to try to

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.200
avoid things like this where the player
can just sort of step out of bounds.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.420
And then, the second thing is that
the bugs move across the screen.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.130
So, here we got a bunch of bugs flying
across the screen at different speeds.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.360
And these are the vehicles.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.257
&gt;&gt; The bad guys [LAUGH].

00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:35.560
&gt;&gt; The bad guys, yeah.
That's what you got to try to avoid.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.820
So, we can see that there is just
this constant stream of bugs.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.690
So, let's kind of recap those
three things real quick.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.140
Player moves.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.320
Bugs move.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.568
And player doesn't fall off the screen.

00:01:44.568 --> 00:01:45.283
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:48.270
&gt;&gt; The fourth piece of
functionality we're looking for

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.605
which you probably just saw.

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:52.580
[LAUGH] Is if I happen to get
hit by one of these bugs.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.170
Here no I fall the way
back to the beginning.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.790
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.370
&gt;&gt; The last little piece
of functionality is sort of

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.630
winning the game in a sense.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.910
And that's if I'm able to get
all the way across the road.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.830
And again we've not hit anything here.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.880
I get across it recessed
the game as well.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.060
&gt;&gt; Which is acceptable.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.460
You can go as crazy as you
want with this project.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; This is the minimum viable passing

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.100
product project.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.280
&gt;&gt; So then the next thing we have is
sort of the criteria called object

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.780
oriented code.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.090
Let's talk a little bit about that.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.780
So the whole course this is built off of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.300
is the object-oriented
JavaScript course.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.930
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Can we go into a little detail about

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.470
what we mean by object-oriented,
and sort of how that differs from

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.780
maybe some of the programming
people are familiar with?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so object-oriented programming,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.750
particularly in JavaScript, is whenever
you write what we call a class.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.080
And so in JavaScript we really don't
have classes, but we kind of fake it.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.030
A class in JavaScript is
any structure that can

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.060
create a fleet of objects
that are similar in nature.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.830
So your bugs for
instance you have three different bugs.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.395
There's really no point in having to
write this out three different times.

00:03:01.395 --> 00:03:02.390
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; You just create

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.800
the general structure
that defines a bug.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.460
And then you instantiate
that object a few times.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.950
One of the biggest
things we're looking for

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.240
is using the prototype object correctly.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.140
You don't want to define your render and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.080
update functions on every
single object on the screen.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.630
You want that type of
functionality to be on the class.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.970
That instantiates the objects.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.850
So then the last three sections in

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.450
the rubric I think should
be pretty straightforward.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.380
Code quality, we're just asking that you

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.670
kind of adhere to the style
guide we provide you.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.190
You format your code, it's easy to read.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.990
I think that's sort of the biggest
point is that if you were to give

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.730
this to your mom,
who doesn't know any JavaScript,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.760
she'd at least be able
to look at it like.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.470
Be able to point out like
you know long lines yeah.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.180
&gt;&gt; Like this makes sense.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.040
Just be consistent, we've had some
questions are going like spaces

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.790
do I use more spaces to spaces or
use tabs.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.460
Just be consistent with your spacing and
your the way you lay things out.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.870
And like you said, we want it to
be readable by our coaches and

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.320
not just one line string of symbols.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.200
&gt;&gt; Then the next one is comments.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.959
I think comments should be

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.310
pretty common practice in any
sort of programming you do.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.210
Even with HTML,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.340
leaving comments in to just say this
is what sort of this section is for.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.640
Comments are just sort of a programmer
to programmer way of communicating.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.360
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so you don't want to have
a comment that says like draw the book.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.420
Because it's pretty obvious that
that line is drawing the book.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.850
Comments are really good for

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.840
answering the question of why
am I doing something this way.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.410
It really is programmer
to programmer talk.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.970
Ten years down the road when you
move on to a new company and

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.020
some guy takes over your application.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.360
You want to leave enough comments that

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.186
he doesn't want to track you down and
kill you.

00:04:57.186 --> 00:04:57.988
&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].

00:04:57.988 --> 00:04:58.541
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:00.580
&gt;&gt; The last one, documentation.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.330
Where we asked the students
to provide us a read me file.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.225
I'd say that's more just so you get into
the habit of writing sort of a read me.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:09.870
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.500
&gt;&gt; Write this is if you
were sending this game

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.520
to a friend didn't want to
be able to show it to them.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.340
&gt;&gt; And especially if you
really go above and beyond.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.550
Kind of make this game your own.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.375
A little bit of a read me at
some of the additions you added.

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:24.740
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; How you did them.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.760
That would all be really, really great.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.270
I mean as documentative as
you can make your project.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.560
The better it's going to look.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
