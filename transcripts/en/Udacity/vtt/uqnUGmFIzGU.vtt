00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.670
This is the correct option. Here, let me explain. About 20 to 25% of babies

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.775
have an avoidant attachment style. Ainsworth described this as a baby who is

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:13.736
not distressed at any time. Not when the caregiver leaves, not when the

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:18.830
caregiver returns. And there's no warm hugs or affection at any time either.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.449
The caregiver is basically ignored.
