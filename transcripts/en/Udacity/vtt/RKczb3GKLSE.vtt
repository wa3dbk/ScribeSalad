00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.560
And sometimes, architectural drift and erosion gets you so

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.450
far away from the point where your software architecture should

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.476
be, that your architecture is completely degraded. And at this

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:13.290
point, you have two main options. The first option is

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.140
to keep frantically tweaking the code. And this normally leads

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.370
to disaster. Why? Because you only make things worse. You

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.570
don't know exactly what you are changing and therefore, you're

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.570
basically stabbing in the dark, trying to fix your system.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.580
The other possiblity is that you can try to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.830
determine the software system architecture

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.710
from its implementation level artifacts,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.520
so you try to derive what the architecture is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.610
and try to fix it, once you have derived the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.266
architecture. And this is what is normally called, architectural

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:44.210
recovery, determining a software architecture from an implementation and fixing

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.410
it. And as you can imagine, this is normally

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.330
a more recommended way to go than the first solution.
