00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's now do the variances. The first one we can copy over, but what is the second number?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Well, you might vaguely remember that the sum of two coin flips or sum of any two

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of anythings you do, the variances just add up.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
With this formula in mind, we find that the variance of two coin flips is 0.5,

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the variance of the sum of 10 coin flips which is 2.5, which is 10 times the number over here.
