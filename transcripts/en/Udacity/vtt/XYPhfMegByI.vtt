00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.433
If you said these two, excellent work. For monomials, we said that the exponent

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:08.736
needs to be non-negative, so that means the exponent must be positive or zero.

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:13.032
Here are two examples where the exponent in the monomial is negative, so these

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:18.133
aren't monomials. This term is negative, but the variable, or n, appears in the

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:22.200
denominator. Any expression or term with a variable in the denominator isn't a

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.310
monomial. These two examples are the same, the b appears in the denominator, and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.193
the x appears in the denominator, so these can't be monomials. You might not

00:00:30.193 --> 00:00:34.219
have gotten this reason right, which is totally okay, it turns out that a square

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.940
root can be written as x to the one half, we haven't even covered this topic

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.904
yet, so if you got that right, that's amazing. We'll see this fractional

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:46.181
exponent, later but I just wanted to preview it now. We do know that monomials

00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:50.405
can be the product of two variables and that they can be positive or negative,

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:54.710
these are the real reasons, why all of these weren't examples of monomials.
