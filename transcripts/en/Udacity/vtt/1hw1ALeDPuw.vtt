00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.309
We are one step closer now, to getting this function in its fully factored

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:08.482
form. Now, we know two of its linear factors. We already found x. And now, we

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:13.248
also know that 2x minus 1 is a linear factor. The next thing for us to do then,

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:16.481
is figure out what's left over if we pull out a factor of 2x minus 1 from this

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:22.301
part of the expression. So, how do we do that? Well, we need to divide this

00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:27.942
expression inside the parentheses by 2x minus 1. Please use long divinsion to

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:34.542
divide 2x cubed minus 13x squared plus 32x minus 13 by 2x minus 1. What do we

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:37.290
get? Write your answer in this green box.
