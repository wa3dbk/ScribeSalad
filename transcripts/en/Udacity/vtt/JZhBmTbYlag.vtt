00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.320
You've now gotten everything you need to
get started with building Android apps

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.630
that use Google Services.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.070
The API's that you've installed, give
you access to all of this functionality.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.950
And they give it to you
in a consistent way.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.240
Remember that Google API client that
you saw for accessing your location?

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.650
It's the same object, and very similar
code to what you'd use to access Google+

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.810
or Maps or Wallet or Drive.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.020
You can learn these in
any order you like.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.000
But the most important thing is
to get started and to get coding.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.470
So, you'll see just how easily you
can harness all this goodness.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.400
You should go and
take the location module first,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.250
because many of the concepts you'll
need for the others are covered there.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.750
Let's go.
