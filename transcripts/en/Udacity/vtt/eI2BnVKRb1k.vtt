00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.500
So let's see if we understood
how DRAM is built.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.640
So what is the reason for
not using a normal transistor and

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.620
a real capacitor when making DRAM?

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.860
Is it because trench cell is easier
to make than a normal capacitor and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.260
transistor?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.800
Is it because the trench
cell is more reliable?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.260
Or is it because the trench cell
let's us make cheaper DRAM chips?
