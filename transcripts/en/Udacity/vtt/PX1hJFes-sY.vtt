00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.290
Now let's have a little more fun by
combining operators and assignment.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.600
Let's create a variable called
totalPayroll and set it equal to zero.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.080
Let's also create some other
variables to hold the salaries of

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.129
three hypothetical players on,
say an athletics team.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.090
One way we can calculate the total
payroll with salaries is to do this,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.000
which isn't too bad,
it all fits on one line.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.050
But in certain cases we may want
to only add one salary at a time.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.960
And if we were to do this,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.200
then our calculations would change
to say something like this.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.770
In this case.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.260
we add one salary at a time to
the existing value of total payroll.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.060
So this isn't too bad.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.090
If we want to add them one at a time,
but we can do better than this by

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.450
combining assignment and
the plus operator all at the same time.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.380
And we can do this by using
the operator we want, in this case,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.560
the addition operator
followed by an equals sign.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.540
And while this may be
confusing at first,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.550
let's look at how the operator
reads from left to right.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.220
First, we want to add to our existing
value and then we want to assign.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.650
And we can also do this with
other operators like subtraction,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.520
multiplication, division and
the modules operator.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.870
So go ahead and fix this up, now we got
the same value by combining the addition

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.920
and assignment for
the addition assignment operator.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.980
If you want to see this with a different
operator, we can change all these signs

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.991
to subtraction signs and now our
total payroll is negative 2, 500,000.

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:32.620
And this would be more appropriate
if we wanted to show deficit

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.480
after paying our players as opposed to
the total payroll that we saw earlier.
