00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:05.880
We've covered a lot of
ground in the session.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.210
&gt;From a quick intro to protocols and
delegation, to learning and

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.510
implementing AV audio recorder.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.680
We're almost the last step in having
a finished pitch perfect app.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.620
Your app can now record sounds and

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.210
pass them over to the play
sounds View Controller.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.180
In the next lesson,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.490
we're going to cover how to play back
audio, what changes the pitch, and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.250
how to more easily position
interface elements using stock fuse.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.770
When you're ready, I'll be waiting for
you at the next lesson.
