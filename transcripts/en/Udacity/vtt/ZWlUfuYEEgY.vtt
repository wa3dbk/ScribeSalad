The answer is that magenta matches c, yellow matches b, white matches d and

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:11.295
cyan matches a. But how did I figure that out? I went into BlueJ and created a

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:17.410
rectangle, and filled it. So I got something like this. Then when I set the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.089
color, it changed to this sort of red-blue color. Cyan is this sort of

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.790
green-blue color. I'm pretty sure I know what yellow and white look like, so

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.286
I'll skip those ones. When I set the color to that color described by a, well,

00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:35.950
that looks exactly like the cyan that we just saw. And if I set it to color b,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.515
that looks like yellow to me. Color c looks like that blue red magenta color.

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:48.988
And color d. Well, that's just white. It doesn't show up very well on a white

00:00:48.988 --> 00:00:54.305
background. If you're curious about this system of marking different colors,

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:58.664
you could try making brown or orange. But that's all we'll do with colors for

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:02.136
now. You've got a little more practice with graphics and a pretty cool project

00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:03.229
coming up.
