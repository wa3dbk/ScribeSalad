00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:03.780
I want to briefly explain why in
this matrix vector multiply example,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.060
it's not safe to make
the innermost loop a par four loop.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.450
First, observe that all iterations j
write to the same location y sub i.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.250
This situation is called a data race.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.630
So more precisely, a data race is at
least one read and at least one write

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.364
that can happen at the same
memory location at the same time.

00:00:24.364 --> 00:00:28.500
So let's take two iterations
j just as an example.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.490
Let's assume that i is equal to 1.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.110
And let's look at j equals 5 and
j equals 100.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.190
And furthermore, suppose that y
sub 1 has the initial value of 0.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.010
Now, suppose I start executing
the two statements simultaneously.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.620
And let's say I evaluate
this multiplication and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.480
this multiplication at
the same time as well.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.410
Maybe hypothetically,
I get the values 72 and minus 100.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.180
Now, suppose I
simultaneously read y sub 1.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.690
Then both statements will get
the value 0 when they read y sub 1.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.449
Now, suppose that j equals
5 executes its right first,

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:09.730
then y sub 1 will get the value of 72.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.009
But in the meantime,

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.920
the j equals 100 statement is
operating with a stale value of y.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.010
So when we do this sum, we'll get
minus 100, and when we do the right,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.030
we'll overwrite the value of
72 instead of accumulating it.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.180
So it's clearly an error.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:29.600
Now, data race that leads to
an error is called a race condition.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.470
So when you're designing
parallel algorithms,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.800
you need to be careful to
avoid race conditions.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.090
As a heuristic, it's often helpful
to avoid data races as well.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.310
But an important point is that
a data race does not always lead

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.010
to a race condition.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.220
You'll see some examples of
that throughout the course.
