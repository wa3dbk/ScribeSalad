Okay, let's start with the Android Operating System. The Android

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.170
system, heavily based on the generation and handling of events,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.640
so it is mostly an event driven system. However, it

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.870
also has some elements of publish, subscribe, in the way

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.480
elements in the system can register for elements of interest.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.570
So we can mark both styles here. So what about

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.449
Skype? We haven't discussed Skype yet. So here we probably

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.019
had to take a little bit of a wild guess.

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.068
But as we will see in more detail in the

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:29.736
rest of the lesson. Skype is mainly a peer to

00:00:29.736 --> 00:00:34.035
peer architecture, with some minimal elements of a client server

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:37.770
architecture. For example, when you start Skype and sign in

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.420
to a conceptually centralized server. So let's move to the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.930
World Wide Web. As we just discussed, the Word Wide

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.255
Web is based on a rest architecture. And because rest

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:50.170
style, is a hybrid derived from other architectural styles, including the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.960
client server architectural styles. Both of those styles apply here.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.465
And finally Dropbox is by and large, a client server

00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:01.904
architecture. As conceptually, we upload our documents to a Dropbox

00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:05.370
central server, and get the files from the same server.
