00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.969
On the demand side, customers in the market for a

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.620
less expensive, smaller diamond are probably more sensitive to price

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.530
than more well-to-do buyers. Many less than one carat customers

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.280
would surely never buy a diamond. Diamond were not for the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.980
social norm of presenting one when proposing. And there are

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.090
fewer customers who can afford a bigger diamond that is

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.250
one that is larger than than one carat, hence we

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.260
shouldn't expect the market for bigger diamonds to be as competitive

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.670
as the one for smaller diamonds. So it makes sense that the variants As well as

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.560
the price would increase with carat size. Now

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.280
often the distribution of any monetary variable like dollars

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.710
will be highly skewed and vary over orders

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.290
of magnitude. Now this can result from path dependence

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.245
for example the rich getting richer, or multiplicative

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:51.470
processes like year on year inflation, or some combination

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.350
of both. Hence it's a good idea to

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.080
look into compressing any such variable by putting

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.050
it on a log scale. For more tips on when to use the log scale and how

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.610
to transform your variables check out the link

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.740
in the instructor notes. Let's examine the distribution

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.370
of price again. In this next programming exercise

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.230
you complete the code to generate two price histograms.
