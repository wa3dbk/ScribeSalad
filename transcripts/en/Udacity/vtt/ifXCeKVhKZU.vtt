00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To compute the function for the P-controller, we're computing the difference

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
multiplied by our large number and then clamp the result.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If this product is smaller than 0, negative that is, 0 will be the maximum.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If this inner value is larger than 200, the minimum will be 200. So this min and max does the job.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We could also use in construction business if or that would take several lines of code

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and then the forward Euler solver for the velocity of the rim.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You simply insert the result of the control as the deceleration of the brake and of course,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you're plugging in the optimum value of 0.2 for the target.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you look at the result, you see that the wheel slip indeed stays close to 0.2, a little less,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but just before the car comes to a complete stop, strange things happen.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We're multiplying tiny errors by huge numbers. That's pretty dangerous when it comes to instability.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
When you use this type of controller, you have to be really careful about stability,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but actually in the next segment, we are going to show that we can use

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
this type of controller anyway for completely different reasons.
