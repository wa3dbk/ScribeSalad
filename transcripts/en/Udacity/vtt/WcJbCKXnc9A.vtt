00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.248
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, this ordered pair, or point would be here. If you got this right, well

00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:08.599
done. I haven't even told you about negative coordinates yet. To think about a

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.035
negative coordinate, instead of moving right, we want to move left. We move left

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.754
because it's the x coordinate. We move in the horizontal direction, this way. So

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:22.358
from the origin, we move three units left and then two units up. I know it can't

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:26.966
be either of these points because well the x coordinate would be positive and

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:31.691
ours is negative, so these are out. The same would be true for this coordinate,

00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:36.025
the x value would be positive 3. If you chose this point, you were a close

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:40.525
second. This point is really 3 to the left or negative 3. And then down 2, so

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:45.456
negative 2 in the y direction. But we don't have a negative 2, we have a

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:50.883
positive 2 for our y coordinate. Once we move three units to the left of the

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:54.167
origin, we must move two units up. So one, two.
