00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.665
So let's talk about three of the best ways to measure brain activity, starting

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:08.544
with the electroencephalography. This is commonly called an EEG. It records

00:00:08.544 --> 00:00:13.698
electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. This

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:16.800
technique is really good at showing general activity of the brain, but it's not

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.157
terribly precise at showing where exactly the activity is occurring. This is

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:25.640
what a typical one would look like. Next, we have the Positron Emission

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.410
Tomography or PET scan for short. This measures blood flow to brain areas that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.456
are activated because neural response requires blood. This technology requires

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:40.112
a person to ingest a harmless radioactive form of oxygen or glucose. The

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:43.460
radioactive level in the oxygen is picked up by the scanning device during

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.956
brain activity. Computers then color code the most active areas in red,

00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:52.051
somewhat active areas in yellow, and the least active areas in blue and green,

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:58.141
like you see here. And finally, we have the Functional Magnetic Resonance

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:02.668
Imaging, or FMRI for short. This also measures blood flow to active brain

00:01:02.668 --> 00:01:08.541
regions. But it doesn't use radioactive forms of oxygen. Instead, the FMRI uses

00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:14.318
magnetic fields to detect regions of the brain that are activated. One

00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:17.216
advantage of this, is that it can give us a very precise picture of which part

00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:23.572
of the brain is active. This is what a typical FMRI machine looks like. Now,

00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:27.168
it's really important to point out that none of these techniques directly

00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:32.268
measure neural activity. They all measure indirectly. There are ways of

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:35.464
measuring individual neurons, but because it involves surgery its almost never

00:01:35.464 --> 00:01:40.106
used on humans. I know there's a lot of information on brain structure. So, if

00:01:40.106 --> 00:01:42.790
you need to you can go over some of the parts of the lesson again or always go

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.200
back to the document we gave you.
