00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So again now the question with 5% confidence, tell me should we return the coin

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because the given one is more fair than the one I wanted or should I accept it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To make it a little easier, I will calculate for you the binomial probabilities and of the null hypothesis

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
0.3 for the 12 possible outcomes from 0 heads all the way to 11 heads.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So here are the approximate values in this table and before you make your decision,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
let me ask you a couple of easier questions--what is the most likely outcome for 11 coin flips

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
assuming that the H₀ is correct and the answer is 3.
