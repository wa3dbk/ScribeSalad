00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.980
An important practice to get all of this to work is

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.230
continuous integration, which means integrating and

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.770
testing every few hours, or a

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.390
day at most, because we don't want problems to pile up and

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.060
to be discovered too late when there are too many of them

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.020
to fix. So what goes on here is a cycle. And the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.380
cycle starts with the developer's programming, as soon as the developers are

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.050
done modifying the code and they have a stable version they will

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.380
run the local tests. If the local tests fail, the developers will

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.350
go back to programming to fix their code and possibly add

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.990
new code as needed, and this cycle, mini cycle will continue

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.000
until all the local tests pass. At that point the developers

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.960
can integrate their code with the code of other developers. And they

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.220
can run test for the integrated system, and when they run

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.830
this test again there are two possibilities. The test might fail, and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.160
if the test fails you broke it, and therefore you'll have

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.710
to fix it. So developers will have to go back and modify

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.010
the system and again going through the cycle of running the local

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.900
tests, integrating, and running the systems

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.890
tests. Conversely, if all the systems

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.150
tests pass, then at that point the code is good to go

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.500
and it is integrated into the system. And it will be the problem

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.370
of some other developers if something breaks because at the time you

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.530
integrated your code, the code was compiling, running and passing the tests

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.495
successfully. So again, if we do this every few hours or every

00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:15.740
day, we can find problems very early, and we can avoid the situations

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.105
in which we have many different changes coming from

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:21.290
many different developers in a integration nightmare as a result.
