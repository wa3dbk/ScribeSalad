00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.990
In these lessons,

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.950
you're going to be learning about how
models can be used to summarize data.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.320
You'll learn about some
statistical analyses for

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.390
describing incoming data sets.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.583
You'll learn how to compare different
models against one another to see which

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:15.010
one's stronger or
which one's a better fit for some data.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.412
And you'll learn about how models can
then be used to predict future data,

00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:19.880
predict future observations.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.553
What we really want you to focus
on here is that model building and

00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:23.600
validation component.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.338
We want you to focus on the role of
model building in machine learning, and

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:30.960
how validation let's us compare
different models against one another,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.700
to see which one's a better
fit to use going forward.
