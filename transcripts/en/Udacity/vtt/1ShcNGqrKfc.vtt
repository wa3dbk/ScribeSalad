00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.040
We've all got busy schedules.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.440
And sometimes we need a little
help managing our daily tasks.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.860
So we decided to make your next project,
a to do list.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.070
You will use your new knowledge
about object oriented principles.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.184
To create a command line to
do list called Udacitask.

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:19.150
Using Udacitask you will be
able to create a to do list.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.890
Add items, delete items,
and mark items as complete.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.930
However, we also want to give you
a chance to personalize this project and

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.605
create three new features that improve
the functionality of Udacitask.
