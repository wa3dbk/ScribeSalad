00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.500
In this exercise, I want you to add another indicator to my watch like object.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.236
I've started by putting a magenta sphere in the scene of radius 10. I've

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:11.765
positioned it correctly but it's not looking at all like a hand. Your job is to

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:15.230
stretch and squish this sphere into something looks kind of like a clock hand

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.886
but centered at the origin like this other hand. I want this hand to be 60 units

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:25.298
long and 4 units wide and high. Use the scale parameter to modify the sphere.

00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:30.114
Once you've properly scaled this sort of an hour hand, rotate it so it points at

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:34.673
11 and 5 o'clock. When you're done things should look like this.
