00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.420
Let's discuss a few more visual cues, the

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.380
first of which is going to be direction. Direction

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.410
is similar to angle, but the direction encoding relies

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.130
on a single vector's orientation in a coordinate system.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.401
By looking at the slope of a given line,

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:19.153
we can easily see increases, decreases, or fluctuations within

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:22.480
our data. However, direction is tricky for many of

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.270
the same reasons that angle is tricky. We can

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.050
easily differentiate a horizontal or vertical line, but when

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.240
we're dealing with lines with angles it's harder to

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.660
see the difference between two that are both negative

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.990
or positive. Another encoding that can be used is

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.680
shape. Shapes and symbols are commonly used to differentiate

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.980
categories of objects. For example, say that we had

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.190
a scatter plot. We could use triangles and squares

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.140
to show trends for two different types of data,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.940
say two different baseball teams, or two different

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.630
districts in our Aadhaar data, something like that. We

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.920
can also use the area or volume of our

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
shapes to encode information. So bigger objects typically represent

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.120
greater values. Like length, when we encode information within

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.060
an area or a volume, we are basically representing

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.830
our data with size. So, say we were using

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.420
circles. The greater the value of the data point,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.810
the bigger our circle is going to be.
