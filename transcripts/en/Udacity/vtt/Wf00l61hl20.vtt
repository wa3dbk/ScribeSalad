00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.050
You've seen how to find the first match now we want to find them all. In our

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.343
picture example we just want to collect all of the portraits. This one, and

00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:12.750
this one. Now if we want to collect them we need to put them somewhere. And you

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.926
just learned how to collect stuff, namely with an ArrayList. So we have two

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:21.150
ArrayLists, the one that contains the elements that we inspect and the one in

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.700
which we will collect our matches. Now for each element in the original

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.921
ArrayList we check if it's a match and if so we add the matching element to the

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:38.830
ArrayList matches. When this loop is complete matches contains all matches.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.286
Like I said this one is actually simpler because we don't need to keep track of

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:45.580
whether we have found the first one we don't need to stop after we found the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.710
first one. Go ahead and implement it in Java.
