00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.522
A rational function is a function that's one polynomial divided by another

00:00:03.522 --> 00:00:08.542
polynomial. Rational functions are like rational numbers, except, instead of an

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:12.510
integer divided by an integer, such as 3/4's, it's a polynomial divided by

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.498
another polynomial. We already saw a simple example earlier, in y equals 1 over

00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:22.516
x. But they can get much more complicated, and therefore, much more

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:27.798
interesting. You might even have something like this. Y equals negative 3x

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:34.268
cubed plus 2x squared minus 7, all divided by X to the 4th minus X. Note that

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.796
actually all of the other choices that I gave you here, also technically are

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:43.014
rational functions. They just all have denominators of 1. Remember that

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:45.974
constants are polynomials, too. Most of the rational functions we'll see

00:00:45.974 --> 00:00:48.170
though, look more like these 2.
