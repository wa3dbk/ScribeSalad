This graph over here on the left is the graph of y equals negative x squared.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.557
As we learned a few lessons ago, when a problem has a negative leading

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:12.760
coefficient, it points downward. Both of its ends are reaching toward negative

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.811
infinity. This other graph over here is representing y equals x squared, with a

00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.793
positive leading coefficient. Note that these graphs are just flipped versions

00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:24.490
of one-another. You get from this one to this one by just taking this graph and

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.259
flipping it across the x axis.
