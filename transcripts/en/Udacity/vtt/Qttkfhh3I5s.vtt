00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.086
So, here's my solution to implementing nextDay and you'll note that I start with

00:00:04.086 --> 00:00:08.087
a docstring. This is treated as a special comment by most Python systems and I

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:11.992
put in this warning to make people realize this implementation is not actually

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:15.478
correct. So, it shouldn't be used to schedule, say, the apocalypse, but it's

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:19.120
good for our testing for now. And the logic is quite simple, if the day is less

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.020
than 30, since we're assuming all months have 30 days, we increase the day by 1,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.014
and I'm returning a three tuple of the year, the month, and the day. Otherwise,

00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:30.674
we need to increase the month, so we're going to advance to the next month and

00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:35.920
reset the day to 1. If we're in December, then we need to increase the year by 1

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.458
and reset the date to January 1st. As with the larger problem, you should start

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:44.660
this by thinking about some test cases. And see that those behave as expected.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.894
We provided some in the example. One nice thing you'll notice here using the

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:52.794
Python shell provided by Idle is that, when I try to use nextDay, I see the

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:56.550
docstring right here. And normally, we want docstrings that are descriptive

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.524
here. The warning is very useful. And I give a sample month, day, and year, and

00:01:00.524 --> 00:01:04.617
I see that I get the right result. I should note that for some cases, say,

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:08.766
January 30th, the day following January 30th should be January 31st. I'm going

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:12.956
to get February 1th because of this assumption about all months having 30 days,

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:16.944
and we should try a more difficult case, such as the end of the year. And here,

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:21.102
I'll use December 31st, it would advance the year whether it's December 31st or

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:24.892
December 30th because of that assumption, and we get January 1st, 2013.
