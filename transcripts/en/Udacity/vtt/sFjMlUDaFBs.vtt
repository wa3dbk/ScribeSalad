00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.690
Let's do an exercise to practice this
chain matrix multiplication algorithm.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.260
Consider matrices A, B, C,
D with dimensions given below.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.200
Use dynamic programming to fill
in the table to the right, and

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.280
then place the parenthesis
in the proper place below

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.500
to minimize the number of
scalar multiplications.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.190
Don't use more parenthesis
than necessary in your answer.
