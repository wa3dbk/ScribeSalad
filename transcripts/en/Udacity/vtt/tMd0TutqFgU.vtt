00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.120
So, source working memory not contains all the things that we had in

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.590
the previous shot. Some of these are percepts. Some the things are the pitcher's

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.220
internal goals. Let us see how the contents of the working memory,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.890
now invoke different kinds of knowledge from the long term memory.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.520
So, let us imagine that the procedural part of source long term

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.350
memory contains the following rules. The procedural knowledge and

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.850
source long term memory is represented in the form of rules.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.550
The system sometimes called production group. In fact,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.640
the term production systems comes from the term production group. So, each rule

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.370
here is a production group. I've shown seven here, there could be more rules.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.788
Once again, these production rules are captured in the procedural knowledge, and

00:00:51.788 --> 00:00:57.060
soource long-term memory. Recall that one of the first things that the pitcher

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.380
had to decide was whether the pitcher should throw a pitch or walk the batter.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.080
Therefore, we assume that there are some rules which allow the pitcher to make

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.810
a decision between these two choices. Thus there is a rule here. If the goal is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.690
to escape, and I perceive two outs, and I perceive on the second, and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.720
I perceive a runner on the second and I perceive no runner on the first base,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.200
then I'm suggest a goal of intentionally walk batter. There is another rule.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.820
The second rule says, if the goal is to escape, and I perceive two outs and

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.300
I perceive a runner on the first base. Or if perceived not out on the second, or

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.460
if perceived no runners,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.720
then suggest the goal to get the batter out via pitching. And what might

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.780
happen if I pick the goal of intentionally walking the batter? The goal

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.990
is to intentionally walk the batter then suggest intentional walk operator. Now,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.920
this intentional walk operator corresponds to some action available to all. And

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.310
similarly, the other rules. Let's consider one other rule, rule number seven.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.540
If only one operator has been selected, then send the operator to

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.280
the motor system and add the pitch thrown to the state. So, there is

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.460
both now an action has been selected, and the action is going to be executed.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.470
As well as the state of the working memory is going to be changed, so

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.990
it will say that now the pitch has been thrown. Before we go ahead, let me

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.100
summarize what we just learned. Source long term memory consists of various

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.430
kinds of knowledge. One kind of knowledge, the one that we are considering right

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.040
now is procedural knowledge. Procedural knowledge is about how to do something.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.930
And so procedural knowledge is represented in the form of production rules.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.330
Each production rule is, is of the form, if something then something.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.890
There are antecedents and their consequence. These antecedents may be connected

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.920
through various kind of relationships, like and, and or. The consequence too

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.730
might be connected through various kind of relationships like and, and

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.130
or. So I may have if some antecedent is true, and some other,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.100
other ante, antecedent is true, and so on, then do some consequent. Now that we

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.860
understand a little bit about the representation of production rules. What about

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.740
the content? What should be the content that we put into these production rules?

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.940
Earlier we had said that cognitive architectures are goal oriented. So

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.150
we'll expect goals to appear in some of the production rules. Indeed, they do.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.910
R1, r2, r3, and so on. Earlier we had said that knowledge based

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.290
AI cognitive systems, use a lot of knowledge. And you can see how detailed and

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.320
specific this knowledge is. In fact, the knowledge is so detailed and

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.390
specific that in principle we can hope that as different percepts come from

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.140
the world, some rule is available that will be useful for that set of percepts.
