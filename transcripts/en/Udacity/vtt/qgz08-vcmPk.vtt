00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.588
&gt;&gt; Now that we have the tiledJSON loaded, we need to parse it. So, let's take a

00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:07.277
closer look at the structure of this file. There's a few things that should

00:00:07.277 --> 00:00:11.000
interest you about this file, right away. First is the initial parameters

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.619
discussing the size of the tiles that this map expects. The second, is the

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.502
number of vertical and horizontal tiles used. For instance, the width parameter

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:24.690
here defines that this map is 100 tiles wide. Of course, the total size of the

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.002
map, in pixels, is width times tile width or 64 pixels per tile, given you 6400

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:35.372
pixels. Secondly, you'll notice that there's a section devoted to what atlases

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:40.252
this map uses, called tilesets. This section will list for each atlas, the image

00:00:40.252 --> 00:00:44.284
location, given the absolute path from the editor as well as the width and the

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:48.253
height of the input images, any particular names or properties that you've

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:52.411
attached to the atlas, and most importantly firstgid, which we'll get into in a

00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:57.962
minute while we're parsing our layer data. Finally, we have a separate section

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:04.587
of the JSON file devoted to the layers that you've defined. Now, each layer that

00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:10.048
exists has a data element, which actually lists out a large, very large,

00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:16.145
ludicrously large array of integer values that represent each tile that you've

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:20.786
placed on this layer. Of course, this layer also has other properties like the

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:24.258
height in number of tiles, as well as the opacity, and then any other

00:01:24.258 --> 00:01:28.292
information like the name and whether or not this tile is visible. This type

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:32.508
parameter is also interesting, because tiled allows you to have both tilelayers

00:01:32.508 --> 00:01:36.387
and object layers. Of course, this layer you're looking at is defined as a

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:37.013
tilelayer.
