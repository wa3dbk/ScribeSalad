00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.193
Recall the formula for finding the distance between two points. Substituting in

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:13.905
the formula for u and c, we get. And when we simplify, we obtain the square root

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:18.043
of 25 plus 9, which gives us the square root of 34.
