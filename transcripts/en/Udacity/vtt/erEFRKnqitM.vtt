00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.110
While it's tempting to respond to the input event inside of the event hamper,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.740
it's generally considered bad practice to do that. Now to get a better

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.630
understanding of that, let's look at this representation of a frame over time.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.328
Our green boxes represent the update of individual items that exist. And the

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:20.255
red boxes represent the rendering of those items. Now, let's say, for instance,

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:24.020
the user hits their keyboard which would move the player around. And, let's

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.922
say, that our engine actually gets that call back right here. So, our updating

00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:31.314
of the player in a specific position has already occurred, including physic

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:35.935
engine processing and everything else. While our rendering will now be pulling

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:40.493
data for a new position in the environment. Now what this particular instance

00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:44.027
can lead to is an interesting phenomena. This makes a disjoint correlation

00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:47.534
between our update loop and our render loop. We can actually be updating our

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:51.025
environment with the player at this position. Yet rendering with the player at

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:54.440
this new position. Now while all this may seem minute in a 30-frames or

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.678
60-frames per second environment. Things get a little cooky once you start

00:00:58.678 --> 00:01:02.634
factoring in network physics which hopefully we'll cover a little bit later. In

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:05.782
practice the events come out a little bit like this. So, let's say we have a

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:09.513
timeline of events that are going to be passed into our application. In a

00:01:09.513 --> 00:01:13.489
timeline that represents our update loop. Now what occurs is that we're not

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:18.235
really sure when the events are going to come to us from the browser. They can

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:18.685
occur

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:19.135
[SOUND]

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:20.474
pretty much any time

00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:20.935
[SOUND]

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.570
they want. Now, what happens is, if we respond to them in turn, we're not

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.437
going to have the ability for our update system, or rather, our game code, to

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:32.208
properly be able to react to them. And so what we do is actually store the

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:37.440
input event data inside of our input manager. So that the update loop, or game

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.320
code, can query it whenever it wants.
