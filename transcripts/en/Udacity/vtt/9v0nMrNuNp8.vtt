00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this problem, we're going to build on some of the JavaScript lesson

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we did in the previous one,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we're going to handle identifiers, numbers, and strings.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Real quick, let's ask ourself, what are the differences between those?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So we have an identifier, and as we talked about it in lecture,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
identifier is a name for something, usually a function or a variable.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We then have numbers, and we're going to be able to handle numbers such as

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
-1, 2., 3.5, etc.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Then we have strings.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This string contains the word, "Blah, an escaped quote--so the string contains this double quote,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Blah, question mark--I don't know if you heard my raised pitch at the end. Blah?--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and then another double quote, and it ends.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We indicate the end of the string with unescaped double quotes.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So we want to write regular expressions to match these things

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because that's how we're going to write the functions that tell the lexer how to tokenize it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So let's do the identifier first.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This one's pretty straight forward.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We need at least 1 letter, and it can't be an underscore,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but the casing doesn't matter.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
After that, it can be as long as we want, and it can have as many underscores as we want

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and then letters as well where the casing doesn't matter.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So that's our regular expression for the identifier.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
For the number, it might be a little trickier.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Let's say we have this number--542.555.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We're going to write a regular expression to match this as well as all the other numbers,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but this has all the pieces that we need to consider in a regular expression.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The first thing is the minus sign.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The minus sign can only occur at the beginning, and it's also optional.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We then can match at least 1 but possibly more numbers up into a decimal point

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
if it exists, but it also can just end there such as the -1 we have here.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So the numbers [0 - 9], and it has to be 1 or more of them.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This goes there. This matches that part.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now we're going to have a chunk that's optional.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
If we go down this route, we have to have a period,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and we have to escape the period because it has meaning in a regular expression.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But after the period, we can only have numbers, and there can be 0 or more of them.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
0 for the case in where you just end in a period, which is often denoted to mean

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
you want a floating point.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But in this case, we're going to treat everything as a floating point.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And then a star.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So that's a regular expression.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
To go back, the dot goes here and these 5's go there.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now we just want to do strings.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We have a regular expression.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The first thing and the last thing we have to match are going to be the double quotes,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and I use a single quote because I don't have to escape the double quotes in this,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and that makes it nice.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In between the double quotes, we can have 0 or more characters inside of them.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Those characters can be in 2 groups.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's either escaped--like we have here--or it's just a character by itself--all the other letters.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So let's do the not escaped first.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
That's going to be anything that's not a double quote or a backslash.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We have to escape the backslash if we want to match that,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
so anything but those.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So it's going to be everything here, all of this, but not these quotes right here

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
because there's a backslash or a quote there.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
If we get any one of those, we're going to match a different rule

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
where we have to have a backslash, but after that backslash, we can have any character,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and that's what the period means.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And I forgot to put my question mark. There we go.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
That's the regular expression that we're going to use.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
As you can see, as these regular expressions get more complicated, doing more complex things,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
they get messy. Messy--very, very quickly.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Sometimes it's really conventient to write a regular expression like this.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Sometimes you might just write a bit of code to do the same thing.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But in this case, regular expressions are super powerful and super fun,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and that's what we're doing here.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Here I have my solution.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I'm going to have 3 types of tokens--

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
the identifier, the number, and the string, which we went over.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I have the identifier, which is exactly the regular expression we came up with.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
All we do is identify that type.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
For the number, when it matches, we're going to call float,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
which converts the string value that is in the token when we get it

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
to an actual floating-point number.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then for the string case, we're going to strip off the quotes and just get the contents

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of the string itself--

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that's what matters most--

00:04:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
ignore whitespace, have to deal with new lines and the errors as well.
