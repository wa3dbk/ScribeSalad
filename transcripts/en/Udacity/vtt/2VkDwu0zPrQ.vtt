00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.958
Implementing remove lowest this way was nice because we already had these

00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:07.165
methods and we could just use them. And this almost reads like a kind of

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:12.030
English now. What's the low score, find the low score, remove the low score.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.664
But these first two steps were kind of repetitive. In this example we had to go

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:22.170
through every item to find what the lowest one was. And then go through them

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.356
again to find the index of it. If this were a very long array with millions of

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:30.200
items in it, we wouldn't want to have to go through all of the data twice just

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.868
to get the location. We would want to think a little deeper and try to combine

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:39.158
some of these loops. So, what if we had a method, getlowScorePosition, that

00:00:39.158 --> 00:00:42.812
would replace the two steps of finding the minimum element and also finding

00:00:42.812 --> 00:00:44.757
it's index.
