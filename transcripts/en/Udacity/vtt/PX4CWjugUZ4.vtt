00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:03.557
Well the answer--this an important answer--is insensitive.

00:00:03.557 --> 00:00:08.779
It doesn't matter, the structure of the matrix. It's insensitive to the structure of the matrix.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.416
It doesn't matter if we have short rows, long rows, all rows the same length,

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:14.315
rows of wildly different lengths.

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:17.683
The performance of the multiplications and the performance of the segmented scan

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:21.152
don't depend on the distribution of elements under rows at all.

00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:24.269
Instead the run time is dependent only on the number of elements.
