Now, I hope everyone feels confident that they can finish daysBetweenDates on

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:07.564
their own. And so, that's the final quiz for this lesson. So, for the answer,

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:11.618
we're going to show you how I actually solve this. I'm going to step through how

00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:15.140
I would solve this and maybe I'll make some mistakes. Hopefully, I will. That

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.534
will make it a little more interesting. We'll keep those in the edited answer.

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:21.998
If you get stuck trying to solve it yourself, go ahead and start watching part

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:25.648
of the answer. But then, go back to try to solve it yourself after you see how I

00:00:25.648 --> 00:00:26.733
solve the first part.
