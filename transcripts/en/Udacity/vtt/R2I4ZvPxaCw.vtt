00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.850
Olivia bikes at e miles per hour and Terrance bikes at 4 miles per hour. Great

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.656
solving for getting these two correct. We start solving the equation by cross

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:16.079
multiplying. So we'll have 30 times x equals x plus 4 times 15. Then we

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.646
distribute 15 to both of these terms to get 30 x equals 15 x plus 60. We

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:28.690
subtract 15 x from both sides to get 15 x equals 60. And finally, we take our

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.816
equation and we divide each side by 15 to get x is equal to 4. We know x really

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:40.186
represents Terrance's speed. So Terrance's speed is 4 miles per hour. Olivia

00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:45.362
bikes 4 miles per hour faster than Terrance. So we know she travels at 8 miles

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:46.620
per hour.
