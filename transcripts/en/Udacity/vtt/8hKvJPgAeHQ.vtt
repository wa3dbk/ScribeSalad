00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.540
Welcome to the first lesson of machine
learning algorithms for trading.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.320
In this lesson we're going to
introduce how hedge funds and

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.300
other financial institutions
utilize machine learning.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.640
In general, the focus is on creating
a model that can be used to predict

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.120
future prices for
stocks or other assets.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.930
Models like these have been around for
a long time.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.810
What's different about machine learning
is that it provides a suite of tools

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.430
that support a data-centric way
to build predictive models.
