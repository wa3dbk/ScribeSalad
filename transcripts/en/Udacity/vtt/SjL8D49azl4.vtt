00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.490
Now that you know the various ways to
read and write from Firebase, you might

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.530
have noticed that to update a piece of
data there are a lot of moving parts.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.830
You can call a write
method to update the data,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.550
then the data's changed
in the Firebase database.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.210
This triggers your listeners
which you've added, and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.260
finally the UI is updated.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.120
With so much going on, when you're
trying to debug what might be going

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.580
wrong anywhere in this process,
it can be a little tricky.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.500
So let me tell you about a helpful
method that I've been using to track

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.870
what my code is sending and
receiving from the Firebase database.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.110
So here I am in my
ShoppingListApplication class.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.003
If you find like you need to debug your
app you can type the following in.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:43.860
Firebase.getdefaultconfig.setloglevel.l-
ogger.level.debug.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.210
This turns on Firebase's debug mode.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.160
And in debug mode, you get a printout
of useful data in the logs

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.650
about what is sent to and
received from, from Firebase.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.110
So let's run the app and
see this in action.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.810
With the app up and running,
I can open up the logcat output and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.450
change it from Verbose to Debug.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.040
Okay, so I've cleared the logs.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.710
I'm going to go ahead and
add a shopping list.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800
And we can see here that,
in the logs, I actually

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.610
get a lot of information about what
was just set and where it was set.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.300
I made this list called Let's Go
Shopping with an anonymous owner, and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.380
here's the timestamp info.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.790
And here it shows the data
that was being sent through,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.970
you can scroll over a little bit.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.960
And if I go over to my dashboard,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.000
I can see that it has in fact
been sent to the database.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.750
Knowing how to both use
the debug logger level and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.165
to make sure that you keep checking
what's going on in the dashboard,

00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:37.600
will help you really make sure that
your app doesn't have any bugs in it.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.500
So now, whenever you run into a bug,
you can always try turning on the debug

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
logger level as well as comparing
what's going on in the dashboard.
