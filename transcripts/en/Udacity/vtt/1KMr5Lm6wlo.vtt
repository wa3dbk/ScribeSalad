00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.238
Let's continue with this extension of the t test. Now that we have gone a

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:09.012
little in depth in the numerator, now let's focus on the denominator. Just like

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:13.236
we analyzed the variability of the sample or samples, which we used in creating

00:00:13.236 --> 00:00:17.268
the standard error, we need to consider the variability of each individual

00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:23.616
sample when we are comparing three or more. Let's ease our way into this idea,

00:00:23.616 --> 00:00:27.712
starting with reflecting back on how the variability of individual samples

00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:34.117
impacts the difference in means. In both of these situations, these two samples

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:39.625
have the same means and therefore, they have the same distance between means.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.285
Nonetheless in only one of these situations are the means significantly

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:46.780
different from each other. Which one?
