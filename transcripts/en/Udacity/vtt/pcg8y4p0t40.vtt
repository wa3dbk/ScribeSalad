00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.100
In the new version of the equation we've come up with, we have an x as a

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.942
denominator, and we don't really want it there. So, I'd like you to solve for x.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:13.556
And, just as a hint, you could probably start by multiplying both sides of the

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:16.971
equation by x. What do you get as your final answer then?
