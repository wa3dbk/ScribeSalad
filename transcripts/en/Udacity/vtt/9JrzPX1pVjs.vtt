00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.960
Cross-Site Request Forgery
is another web-based attack.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.580
A user's browser may be running
a script from a good site and

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.990
also malicious script from a bad site.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.620
This can happen when the user has
logged into the good site and

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.550
kept the session alive.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.510
For example, the user has logged
into Gmail and has not logged off.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.570
Meanwhile, the user maybe
browsing other sites

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.460
include the bad site that sends
malicious script to the browser.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.390
The malicious script can then
forge a request to the good side

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.210
using the users cookie.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.830
The good side does not know that
the request was not sent by the user,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.490
here's an illustration.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.570
The user logs in, and establishes
a session with a good site, and

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.240
keeps the session alive.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.810
Meanwhile, the user browses a bad site.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.380
For example, because he's phished.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.880
And the browser runs a malicious
script from the bad site.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.960
The malicious script then sends
forged requests to the good site.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.670
Here's a realistic example.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.489
A user logs into bank.com and
forgets to sign off.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.150
The session cookie remains in browser.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.700
The user then visits a malicious
website which sends an HTML page

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.620
that contains a hidden I frame that
includes this malicious content,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.030
that is when the user's browser displays
the HTML page, actions will be performed

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.280
on the bill payment form of bank.com
as if users are entering these values.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.420
Because the I frame is invisible
the user knows nothing about it.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.100
The browser will send a request
on behalf of the user and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.180
without his consent or knowledge.
