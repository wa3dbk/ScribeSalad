00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
So now we have an expression for the y intercept of a line with slope m that

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.646
goes through the point s, t. What happens if we plug this expression for b into

00:00:09.646 --> 00:00:14.656
the general equation for slope intercept form? Write the equation that, that

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:16.309
would give us in this box.
