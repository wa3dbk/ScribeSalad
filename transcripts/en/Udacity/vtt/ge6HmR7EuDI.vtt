00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.166
So here's one way we can define hashtable_add. We're going to define

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:06.720
the procedure hashtable_add. So the first thing we want to do is

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.310
find the right bucket. We'll use hashtable_get_bucket we just defined to do

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.790
that, passing in the table and the key. We'll store that in

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.430
the variable bucket. The next thing we would need to do

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.350
is add the new key value pair. And we can do that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.000
using append. Append will add a new element to the list. And

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.560
what we want the list to be, is a new list with

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.460
two elements, the key and the value. So let's try this in

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.930
the Python interpreter, and I've done essentially the same thing that we

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.780
did before, except for we don't really need the variable bucket. We

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.490
can do the append right away. So i'm getting the bucket and

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.360
then append the new entry to it. So we'll start, we'll make

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.540
a hash table. We'll keep the size of the hash table very

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.520
low. We would never really want a hash table with only three

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.650
buckets. But to make it easy to look at the results, we'll keep

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.414
the hash table very small, and let's add to our table a key

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:59.080
and value. And for our actual web index the values will be a

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.190
list of urls. For our test, they could be anything, so let's just

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.160
use a number, and now we can look at table, and let's run that.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.750
And we see we have the table. We have

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.120
three buckets, and one of the buckets contains an elements.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.650
If we look at the bucket that we get

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.690
from hashtable_get_bucket for the key udacity, we should get the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.830
bucket, that contains the word udacity. let's try that.

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:30.660
That works and we can add some more words to

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.720
our hash table, more key value pairs to our

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.460
hash table. So now we've, we have got three entries

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.650
on our hash table, they all happen to end up in different buckets. That's just

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.730
lucky in this case. let's add one more, so we have a bucket that contains more

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.400
than one entry. And we should print our table after adding one more.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.800
And now we have one bucket with one word, one bucket with two entries and one

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.630
bucket with just one. Now, there is one

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.259
big problem, with the way we did hashtable_add.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.470
Suppose we add the same word again, and let's say

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.690
now the value of udacity is 27. So now we

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.150
are making a hashtable that has three buckets. We're adding

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.900
a bunch of entries to it, we've added the entry udacity

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.940
twice, now when we get the bucket for udacity. What

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.350
we see is we have a bucket that has the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.280
same keyword twice. If we want our hash table to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.080
be a mapping between keys and values, this is going to be

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.150
a problem. If we have the same keyword twice, when we

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.880
look up udacity, well, we don't know which answer we should get.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.410
Is the value 23 or is the value 27? So, what we

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.580
want is something a little different from add. What we want is

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.180
to make sure that every time we add a new keyword

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.190
to the hash table. If it already exists, instead of having two

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.180
entries with the same keyword. What we'll do is change the value

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.170
associated that is associated with that keyword. So we have a problem

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.990
if we have two entries with the same keyword. We're

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.490
going to fix that later. Before we fix that, let's define

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.760
look up. And it will turn out that lookup will

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.240
actually be helpful in defining a better version of add.
