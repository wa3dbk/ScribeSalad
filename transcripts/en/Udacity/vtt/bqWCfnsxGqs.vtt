00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
These list comprehensions are amazing.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
They are one of my favorite parts of Python.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is really a great way to program. It's very declarative.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You just say what you want, and the system makes it for you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Unfortunately, they have a slight downside, which is that thus far

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we've had to write out the starter list, and that's almost as much work

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as just writing down what we need.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If only there were some way to generate this list,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
especially if it's really big, without us having to write it down explicitly.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For example, suppose I started with a big list like this, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I assert it's big. It's big for me.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is heavy lifting for your professor.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And what I want to do is filter it down so that we only have the odd numbers.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I want to get this part out.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm going to show you a new way to do that in Python.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Here I've written a procedure called odds_only in Python

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that takes a list of numbers, and it's going to iterate over them.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
For every n in that list of numbers, if that number is odd,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we divide it by 2 and check the remainder.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
5 divided by 2 is 4 with remainder 1, so it's odd.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We yield that part into our results.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Note that I did not write the word "return."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Yield is a new special keyword that means we can use this sort of procedure

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to gather up multiple results.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's imagine that this big list here was numbers.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We'll yield 1, not do anything with 2, yield 3,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
not do anything with 4, yield 5, not do anything with 6, and yield 7,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and that's exactly the output that we wanted.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You can view this as sort of a convenient way of filtering.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Here I've written out our odds_only procedure.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm just going to show you in the interpreter how this plays out.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm using a list comprehension.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I want to print out every value of x that's in odds_only of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we get 1, 3, and 5, as we expected.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm also going to show you an even easier way to do this.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Snap, it'll be so cool.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Here I've written a list comprehension.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I want [x for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But over here on the right I've put this sort of if conditional,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a guard or a predicate we might call it in mathematics,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and this is saying I only want you to yield

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
those numbers for which the predicate is true.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Only include x in the answer if x was an odd number,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and look, we get the answer we wanted.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I've written x a few times, but I can make these formulas

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
arbitrarily more complicated.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Here I've said take all of the odd numbers, and multiply them by 2.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Since 1, 3, and 5 were the odd numbers, 2, 6, and 10 are the multiplication by 2.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I love list comprehensions, and you will too soon.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
A function like odds_only that uses yield

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to potentially return multiple answers is called a generator

00:02:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
because you can use it to generate another list or another enumeration.
