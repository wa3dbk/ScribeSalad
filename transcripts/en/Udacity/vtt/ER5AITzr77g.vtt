00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.130
So here are our population parameters. Let's say that I want to bring up this

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.040
ratio. So I want more people to watch more of the lessons, so I'm going to spice

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.936
things up. Well in lesson nine you're going to learn how to formally determine

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:18.059
whether or not something had an effect. This is called hypothesis testing. And

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.399
I'm thinking about writing a song on how hypothesis testing works and then

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:27.411
singing it for you in the next lesson. Like, for example, do you remember

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:34.430
learning the quadratic formula? X equals negative b plus or minus the square

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.180
root of b squared minus 4ac. All over 2a and those are the roots of a quadratic

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.278
function. Some people learned it in middle school as a song and maybe that made

00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:51.408
learning it a lot more fun. So I'm thinking about writing a song on hypothesis

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:55.815
testing. And by the way, this is no joke, I'm seriously considering this.

00:00:55.816 --> 00:01:00.307
However, I don't want to run the risk of a song hurting rather than helping your

00:01:00.307 --> 00:01:05.319
engagement with the course material. So, maybe I'll create the next lesson with

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.216
the song, but only make it available to a random sample of 20 students. And I

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:14.312
won't force them to watch it, I'll just do the same thing I always do, just make

00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:18.702
it available every week, just like I make the other lessons available. Then I'll

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:24.615
look at this ratio. Let's pretend that for this sample we get that the mean

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:25.794
ratio is 0.13.
