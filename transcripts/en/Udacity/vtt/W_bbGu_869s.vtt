00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.200
Before getting to our demo, we still have two steps to consider.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.570
The first step corresponds to the identification of the test case specifications

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.890
in our general systematic approach. And in fact, it's called produce and

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.410
evaluate test case specifications. This is a step than can be completely

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.590
automated given the results of the previous steps. And the final result

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.860
of this step is the production of a set of test frames.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.820
Where a test frame is the specification of a test. Let me

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.330
show you an example of this. What we are looking at here

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.380
is a test frame for the program split. Test frames are normally

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.460
identified by a sequence number. But in this case we are looking at

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.290
the 30th six test frame. And what they do is simply to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.280
specify the characteristic of the inputs for that test. In this case, since

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.920
we have two inputs, we have two entries, the first one for

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.010
string str tells us that the length of the string has to be

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.840
size minus 1, and that the string has to contain special characters. And

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.380
for size, it tells us that the value of size has to be

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.340
greater than zero. As the title says, this step is meant

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.790
to produce but also evaluate the case specification. What does it mean

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.070
to evaluate? One of the advantages of this approach is that we

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.420
can easily use it to assess how many test frames and therefore

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.120
how many test cases we will generate with the current least

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.340
of categories, choices and constraints. And the beauty of this is that

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.320
if the number is too large we can just add additional constraints

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.840
and reduce it. And given then the step is automated we just

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.030
add constraints push a button and we get our new set of

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.580
test frames. And again we can have a wait it either go

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.560
hat or add more constraints if we need to further reduce it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.320
and this is something else that we will see in our demo.
