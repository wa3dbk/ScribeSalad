00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.320
So let's do it, let's make a scatter plot. To make it easier, on the X axis,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.751
we'll say that the miles are in 10,000's. So 60,000 will correspond to say, 6

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:15.790
on this axis and the value of the car we'll say is in 1000's. Click where on

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.170
this graph these points belong.
