00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.750
So suppose that we have a smarter tester, a tester which can detect when any

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.090
state is identical to a previously visited state. In that case the tester may

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.860
decide that this, this, and this state are identical to the initial state and

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.500
therefore dismiss them. The tester also dismisses this state, as usual,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.970
because of the problem specification that one cannot have more prisoners than

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.009
guards on any one bank. This leaves the following state of affairs.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.030
Note also that this particular state has no successor states,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.180
all successor states of this have been ruled out. Therefore this particular part

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.290
clearly is not a good path to get to the gold state. If we notice also,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.860
that these two states are identical, then we can merge them. If we do so,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.460
then we get exactly the same kind of configuration of states that we had when we

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.750
were dealing with the semantic network in the previous lesson. There is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.710
something to note here. We had this semantic network in the last lesson, but

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.620
the knowledge representation of semantics network, while very useful,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.860
by itself and of itself doesn't solve any problems.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.270
You need a problem solving method that uses knowledge afforded by the knowledge

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.560
representation to actually do the problem solving. Generating test is one

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.810
of those problem solving methods. In general, when we do problem solving or

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.470
reasoning, then there is a coupling between a knowledge representation and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.740
a problem solving method, like semantic networks and generating test.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.220
What we did so far had a dumb generator, but we made the testers smarter.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.179
The testers started looking for what states had been repeated.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.290
Alternatively we can shift the balance of responsibility between them and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.410
make the generator smarter. Let's see how that might happen.
