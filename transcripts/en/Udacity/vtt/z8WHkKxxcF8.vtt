00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.480
GitHub is a website that makes it easy to share an entire git

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.400
repository with other people.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.850
For example, here's a repository that we've created at Udacity.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.650
This repository is the source for

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.620
a browser-based, create your own adventure story.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.850
Here are all the files in the repository.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.080
I can click round and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.990
navigate the directory structure and I can look at the commit history.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.150
If I go back to the main page and scroll down a little bit,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.160
you can see some information about the project.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.580
I can also directly view the contents of files, assuming they're plain text,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.710
like code or the story.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.990
GitHub also supports a couple of other formats for

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.190
things like images, 3D models, and map data.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.260
In this file, I can click through to the story itself and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.190
start making some choices.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.880
You can always go back to the main page at the repository by clicking here.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.130
This is a public repository so anybody can look at these contents and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.300
suggest changes.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.720
Caroline and I will go over how this works in detail in this lesson and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.690
by the end of the lesson, you'll be able to contribute to it yourself.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.220
This is a living project, so by the time you visit this page things might look

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.520
a little bit different, but the basics will be the same.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.860
GitHub is the home of many public projects like this one.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.970
A lot of public projects are open source, meaning that you can copy and

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.460
modify the code for your own purposes.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.590
GitHub also let's you suggest changes and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.100
send them back to the creator of the project.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.990
Some of these open source projects are pretty small, and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.470
relatively unknown, like mathquill, which only has ten contributors.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.070
You might recognize this one.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.460
Some projects are much larger, like iPython, an interactive shell for

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.680
Python that's nicer than the one you get by default.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.070
Another large project is Bootstrap,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.280
which is a framework that makes it easier to do web development.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.360
There's also jQuery, a JavaScript Library that makes it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.170
easy to interact with HTML and Atom, a text editor designed for

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.740
editing code, and allowing users to customize their experience.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.430
These are projects that anyone could theoretically contribute to, of course,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.260
any changes must be accepted by the people maintaining the project.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.770
But even if the original author chooses not to incorporate your changes,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.990
you can still keep your own version.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.890
GitHub aims to promote open source by allowing anyone to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.350
host public repositories for free and charging for private repositories.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.210
Many companies including Udacity use Git to keep track of changes to their

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.727
proprietary code and use GitHub to host a private copy of their repository and

00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:24.700
allow for easy code reviews when developers submit changes.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.580
For this lesson you'll be interacting with GitHub a lot.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.510
Creating, modifying, and suggesting changes to public repositories.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.560
So you'll need to set up an account.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.940
This is pretty straightforward but

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.730
you'll probably also want to get set up to smoothly interact with

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.480
GitHub from the command line which is a little bit more involved.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.410
You'll see instructions for how to get everything set up after this video.
