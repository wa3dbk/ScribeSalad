00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To me the best answer is the last one.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The reason being that this area of the pie most closely resembles 20% of the pie.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, closely related is the first one where we cut out a quarter of the pie.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But a quarter is 25%.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So this is slightly smaller than a quarter.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I think it's the best one to correspond to 20/80 in this pie chart.
