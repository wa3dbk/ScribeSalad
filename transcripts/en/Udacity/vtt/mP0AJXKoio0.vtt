00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.090
So I want to introduce one more operation on strings, which

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.930
we'll find very useful, which is the Find operation. It gives

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.980
us the way in a big string to find some sub-string

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.770
that we're looking for. The way we use Find is a little

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.910
different from the way we've used other operators so far. Because

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.320
Find is actually a method, and what that means is it's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.430
a built in procedure provided by Python. We'll be able to

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.860
define our own procedures soon, we'll get to that in unit two.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.630
Find is a procedure that operates on strings, so we use it by having

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.189
a string followed by .find, followed by

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.500
a parentheses, then we pass in another string.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.700
Which is the string that we want to find in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330
the first string. And the output of Find is the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.550
position in the string where that sub-string is found, the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.720
first occurrence of the string. So, if that string happens

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.290
to occur in more places than one in the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.380
input string, the result of find is always going to give

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.900
us the position. That's the number where the first occurrence

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.630
of the sub-string occurs. So the output of using Find

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.060
will be the first position in the search string, which

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.390
is this blue string right here, where the target string,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.520
which is the purple string, occurs. So that will be

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.200
a number. If the target string is not a found anywhere

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.760
in the search string, then the output would be negative

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.140
1. So let's try a few examples to understand how

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.970
that works and we'll do this in the Python interpreter.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.210
Here I've initialized the variable Pythagoras to hold the string here

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.360
that's been attributed to Pythagoras. We don't know if

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.190
he really said it. But it says there's a geometry

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.930
in the humming of strings, there is music in

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.100
the spacing of spheres. So now, we have that variable

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.710
initialized, so I'm going to invoke Find, using Pythagoras as

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.970
the string that we're searching in, and that's the value

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.800
that we initialized it to with a string, passing in

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.290
as the search string the string string. When we run

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.450
this, we see that we get 40 as the result. If we counted, this is position 0, we

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.600
would see string starting at position 40. Since I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.110
don't want to count that far, we can use our indexing

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.560
to see if that's right. So let's print Pythagoras

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.880
starting from index 40, we could print all the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.980
way to the end using a colon. And, when

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.870
we run that, we see that it starts with string

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.820
which is what we found with the Find. We can search

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.380
for other positions if we search for Pythagoras the single letter T.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.515
Well that matches the beginning, so we should find the resulted position

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:34.930
0 which is what we get and we can look for sphere.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.210
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.565
That will match sphere at the end. We get

00:02:41.565 --> 00:02:45.410
position 86. Let's print the quote from position 86. And

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.130
we see the end of the quote starting from sphere. [SOUND]

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.470
If we search for a string that's not in the string

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.840
that we're using as the search string, so let's look for

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.770
say, algebra, which was not in the quote from Pythagoras, we

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.800
get the output negative one. That means the string was not found.
