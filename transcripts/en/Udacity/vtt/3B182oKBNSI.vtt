00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.696
Let's dig into some of the details of the DHT technology. The first name-space

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:10.840
that the DHT technology has to deal with is the key-space name-space.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.670
So the way name-space is managed is, if you have content to

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.980
disseminate. You generate, a unique key, for the content,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.478
by using some algorithm like SHA1 which generates a

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:32.259
160-bit key. The number of bits in the key or the signature is big enough that

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.950
they will not recollision even if different content

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.620
are using the same algorithm to generate this key.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.280
So that is how you create a unique

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.380
signature for a particular content, using SHA-1. The second

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.880
name-space we have to deal with is a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.660
node-space. So here, what we're doing is, we are

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.310
creating an SHA-1 hash of IP addresses of nodes that want to share content.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.090
So, let's say that me and my buddies. Form a social network and all our IP

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.660
addresses, we going to use this algorithm to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.222
encode them into this 160-bit node id. So

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:11.034
now we've got two name-spaces, one is the

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:15.746
key-space, name-space and the node-space, name-space, and both

00:01:15.746 --> 00:01:18.710
of them are derived using the same algorithmic

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.070
technique, let's say. So in this case we've

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.940
created a key for the content so that

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.490
there's a unique signature for a particular content,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.970
similarly, we've created a node id from the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.000
IP address, which is again a unique signature

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.570
for a particular IP address. The objective is, if I have a key, I want to store.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.670
That key in a node id N, such that the key is very close to the node id

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.270
N. Ideally, if you're lucky, the key is exactly

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.870
equal to N, but, you know, it's not possible

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.870
to guarantee that this hash and this hash will

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.420
result in exactly the same value. So long as

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.570
it is close enough, like in the previous example

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.280
I showed you. That if I generated a hash 149,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.440
I stored it in that node 150, which is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.490
close enough to the hash that I created. So the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.210
API for manipulating this distibuted hash table data structure would

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.910
be putkey and getkey, so putkey would take two arguments.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.500
The key and the value. Value can be anything

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.790
that you want to associate with that. In the previous

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.960
example, I've said the value may be the IP address

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.620
of the content that is associated with the particular key.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.890
And getkey takes one argument, namely the key, and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.700
returns the value that is associated with that key-value pair.
