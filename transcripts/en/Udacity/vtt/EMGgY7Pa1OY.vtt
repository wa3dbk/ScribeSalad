00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.630
The process we just went
through will repeat.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.370
But running Saga a second time will
create totally new execution context

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.190
instead of referencing
the original blue context.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.540
This accommodates for
storage of different bindings.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.470
As ever, the interpreter's
lookup focus will also shift

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.320
into the newly created content.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.230
The var declaration creates
a new variable in this context.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.520
And if you like to think about the
storage layout that languages use for

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.670
your data, you could say that
this variable is stored in

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.640
a new distinct location
from the first one.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.290
Now while this isn't necessarily
the case, it's likely true and

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.030
it's a useful way to think about it.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.040
What values do you expect
to be logged by this line,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.960
given the current in memory conditions
