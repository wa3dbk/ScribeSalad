00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.498
We saw before that x minus a is a factor of f of x if f of a equals 0. So that

00:00:06.498 --> 00:00:09.519
means we can test the constants that we came up with in the last quiz by

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.911
substituting them in for x here and seeing which ones of them gives us y equals

00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:17.319
0. So that it's clear what we're plugging in, I'm going to switch to function

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:22.296
notation up here instead of using y. Let's make this f of x instead. Great, now

00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:25.784
it'll be very clear what numbers we're plugging in. Let's start with something

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:30.350
from down here, maybe one, since that's first in the list. First tell me what f

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.070
of 1 equals, using this function, and then tell me whether or not that means

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.003
that x minus 1 is a factor of this function.
