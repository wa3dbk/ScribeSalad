00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
And the answer to that question of course is a little more subtle.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.130
So there's two reasons why that doesn't work.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.350
The first reason is a very formalistic one. The RAM can only handle integers.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.710
Or at least the RAM cannot handle numbers with an arbitrary precision

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.930
because having an arbitrary precision is exactly the same thing as having

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.550
an infinite amount of values available for each variable.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.630
And we said that the RAM doesn't support that.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.960
And actually your computer also doesn't fully support that.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.980
So you might be working with numbers such as 1.2345 or so,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.270
but these numbers are always rounded numbers.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.360
So also your computer does not have arbitrary precision.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.900
It' s pretty well thought out normally how your computer handle such numbers

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.410
which is why we normally don't notice but in general

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.240
there's no arbitrary precision for your computer also.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.520
Secondly, the table size wouldn't change. So we're not allowed to do this.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.090
But let's say we're allowed to do this and then represent all of the values in the table exactly.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.130
Then, the table size itself wouldn't change because you start out with a table that has

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.260
1, 2, 3, 4 and so on until you get to the columns.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.660
And now in your new table, you would just have the same amount of columns

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.500
only the columns would be labeled 1/v, 2/v, 3/v, 4/v until you get to 1.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.430
The third and the fourth are not valid reasons.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.160
Just because then P would be NP is no counterargument against this.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.850
And of course, as I've just shown you, that is also not true.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.180
But asking this question here leads us to something else.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.770
What if we were to divide all values by some number, which I'm going to specify to you,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.370
and then round it down.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.810
By rounding, we do two things.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.560
So by rounding, we would make numbers that the RAM can handle.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.380
And also in the case of rounding, the table size would change.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.340
So let's say you had a table that looked like 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and so on.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.030
Then, you could always put two columns together. So these two.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.440
Except for the first one. That would become 0. But all the others you can put together.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.990
So those two would become column 1. Those two would become column 2.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.750
If you have 3.5 here, they would become column 3 and so on.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.070
So you would be able to scale down the table but of course the whole thing comes at a price.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.000
Because scaling down the table means that you put two columns together

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.490
only taking the minimum of it and therefore possibly arrive at a suboptimal solution.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.520
Because certain objects where one object has a slightly higher value than another one

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.430
become indistinguishable using this technique.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.310
Well, we're not going to divide by V. We're going to divide by some factor.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.450
Dividing all values by a certain factor is a good idea but we have to round and this gives us an error.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.170
Now, if you take a close look at this, you can almost see the approximation algorithm

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.900
emerging here because what happens when this factor here becomes very large?

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.500
Well, then we scale down the table that we build a lot.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.770
So here we have n and here we have v.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.290
If we divide all values by some large factor and of course we have to round,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.280
then this table here becomes very small but of course our error also increases.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.410
And if this factor here is very small, which means we almost keep all of the original table,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.280
well then our running time is still very large but the error that we make is potentially smaller.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.850
So this is exactly where the time and quality tradeoff will come from.

00:03:24.850 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's now have a look at that in more detail.
