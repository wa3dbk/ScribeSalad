00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.132
We'll reject h not, because our t statistic is huge. We know that this will

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:09.794
fall well beyond the t-critical value no matter what significance level we

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:15.769
choose, the smallest usually being 0.01. We reject h-not because the

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.266
probability of getting this T statistic? In other words the probability of

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:26.117
getting this sample mean from a population with mean six point zero seven is

00:00:26.117 --> 00:00:32.900
very, very small. That's the p value. It's the probability of getting this

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.392
value if the null hypothesis is true. Since the probability is so small, then

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:43.770
there must be something else going on. The null hypothesis is probably not

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.349
true. Finches with this beak width come from an entirely new population. Not

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:53.693
equal to 6.07 as the mean.
