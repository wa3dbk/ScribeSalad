00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.938
As you saw by that Beck test,

00:00:01.938 --> 00:00:05.600
regression-based forecasting
can be useful.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.600
It's also worth noting that that
particular Beck test was not

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.760
spectacular.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.280
It did indeed beat the S&amp;P 500,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.265
which is important, but
it didn't beat it spectacularly.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:22.900
[LAUGH] Usually we find that
performance in the real world

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.200
Is not as awesome as in back testing.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.880
So we would probably still see
good return from that strategy but

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.510
it wouldn't be quite the same
as we saw in that back test.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.300
So I want a list a few problems
we see sometimes with regression

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.300
based forecasting.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.990
First of all, our forecasts always
seem to be noisy and uncertain.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.520
So there is value in there, but

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.220
it has to be accumulated over
many trading opportunities.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.920
It's hard to know how confident
you should be in a forecast.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.670
I mentioned in my software demo
a moment ago that we could look at

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.590
standard deviation of
the nearest neighbors.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.820
That works okay.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.810
It's really not too strong of a measure,
however.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.630
So it's difficult to know how confident
you ought to be in any particular

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.550
forecast.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.280
It would be nice if you could know
because that would enable you to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.730
essentially bet less on
forecasts that are less certain.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.070
Additionally, it's not clear how long
you should hold a position that might

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.550
have arisen from a forecast, and how
you should allocate to that position.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.730
These are all challenges using
regression based forecasting.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.280
Some of these issues can be addressed
using reinforcement learning.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.260
Where instead of making a forecast of
a future price, we had the system learn

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.240
a policy and the policy tells the system
whether to buy or sell a stock.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.200
We'll get to this towards
the end of this class but

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.630
it's an interesting alternative to
the regression based approaches

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.390
we're going to use here at
the beginning of the class.
