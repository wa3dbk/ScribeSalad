00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.130
Congratulations. You're done doing all four challenges. We have one

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.320
optional challenge, of putting everything

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.690
together. Measurement uncertainty and trying

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.590
to chase an escaping robot with you being just as

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.480
fast as the robot. There's a reason why I'm not counting

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.000
this, we're making it optional. It turns out when I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.209
tried to program it, it was actually really hard. Was hard

00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:22.440
for our [UNKNOWN], so it is a real challenge. You

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.200
might want to try it but we didn't want to make it mandatory.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.770
But, try it out and see how far you get.
