00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.600
Quantitive research is effectively
research with numbers.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.480
Those numbers could be test grades.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.580
They could be scores on
some attitude inventory.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.100
They could really be any kind
of objective measure of reality.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.080
The really nice thing about quantitive
research is it gives us a toolbox of

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.130
analyses we can use with our data to
understand the conclusions of it.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.760
We could, for example, compare the means
of two different groups to see if one

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.820
outperformed another on some task.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.060
We could analyze how a group of
students performed after getting

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.760
some intervention from us to see if some
measure of their performance improved.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.960
So the nice thing about quantitative
research is it has a suite of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.656
tools we can use to create
easy-to-understand,

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:39.910
easy-to-defend conclusions
about our research.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.180
Now two places we get a lot
of quantitative data for

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.410
quantitative research are controlled
experiments and survey results.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.090
But those aren't the only two places.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.300
So here we'll talk about the different
places we can get quantitative data for

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.680
this kind of research and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.230
some of the different analyses we
can use to process this research.
