00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.110
So far, error handling has come in
the form of .catches like this one.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.810
But there are actually other ways.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.615
These two chunks of code
are actually equivalent.

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:17.950
.catch is just shorthand for .then
undefined and then a rejection function.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.540
Notice how, this then is
actually is taking two arguments.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.600
The full function signature for
then is actually this.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.245
In this form,

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:30.460
if any previous promise is rejected,
the reject function gets called.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.860
If they resolve,
then the resolve function get's called.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.220
If there is no resolve function and
the promise before this then resolves,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.489
then this then gets skipped over and
the next then is called.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.620
In all cases,
as soon as a promise rejects,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.880
then the JavaScript engine skips to
the next reject function in the chain,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.976
whether that's in a .catch or a .then.

00:00:52.976 --> 00:00:55.740
So that means an error
here in this promise or

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.885
here in this promise,
both get caught by this cache.

00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:05.660
Both methods .catch and .then with
two callbacks work equally well.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.010
However, it's actually recommended
that you use .catch when you can,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.570
because .catch is just
easier to read and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.690
write than a second .then call
back which can be hard to spot.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.850
In fact, you might not have
even noticed it right here.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.630
That being said,
there is a major difference

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.190
in the execution order between
.catch and a second call back.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.480
Notice that you cannot call
both the resolve function and

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.825
the reject function if they're
part of the same .then.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.150
Only one or the other, or
neither will get called.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.903
If something goes wrong with the resolve
function, you'll need another .catch or

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:46.320
another .then,
farther down the line to catch it.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.600
But if you have .then and then a .catch.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.940
Each with their own resolve or
reject function.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.790
Both of them can possibly get called.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.810
And finally,
I want to make one more subtle point.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.570
It's also worth noting that
it isn't necessarily true,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.220
that passing a value to resolve
means that the promise succeeded.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.340
This is a subtle point.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.590
So go see Jake Archibald's blog
post in the instructor notes for

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.258
more information.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.130
In the next quiz, you'll be thinking
through the flow of a chain of promises

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.330
using different formats.
