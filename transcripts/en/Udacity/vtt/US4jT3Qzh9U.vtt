00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.649
So let's look at the trend of the step complexity of parallel reduction.

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:10.058
First we're going to look at what happens when we add 1, 2 elements to create 1 output.

00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:14.420
So if we have 2 elements in our input sequence, it's going to take 1 step to finish.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.432
If we have 4 elements in our input sequence, it's now going to take 1, 2 steps to finish.

00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:25.003
And if we have 8 elements in our input sequence--

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:31.886
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--we know that it's now going to take 1, 2, 3 steps to finish.

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.311
So the quiz is, what is this relationship?

00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:37.438
Is the number of steps as a function of n,

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:42.395
√n, log2(n), n, or n log2 (n)?
