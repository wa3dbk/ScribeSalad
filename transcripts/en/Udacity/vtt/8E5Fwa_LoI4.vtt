00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.200
Here are our solutions. 1.5 times 10 to the 11th meters is the distance from

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.069
the earth to the sun. 2.4 times 10 to the 22nd meters is the distance to the

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:14.276
Milky Way's nearest neighboring galaxy, Andromeda. 1.7 times 10 to the 1st

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:19.079
meters is the height of a human. 8.8 times 10 to the 5th meters is the distance

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.830
from San Francisco to Paris. And 2 times 10 to the negative 4 meters is the

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.549
size of an ant.
