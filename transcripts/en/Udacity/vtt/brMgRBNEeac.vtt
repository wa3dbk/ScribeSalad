00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.560
The mini net tool we have been using

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.040
in the course, is actually a example of, network

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.080
visualization, we are in fact running a, an

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.940
entire virtual network, on your laptop. When you start

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.950
mini net using the MN script, each host

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.695
in the virtual network, is a bash process. With

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:23.270
it's own network name space. A network name

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.490
space is kind of like a virtual machine except

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.664
it's a lot more lightweight. It's infact

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:31.350
called OS Level Virtualization. So, each one of

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.000
these virtual nodes, has its own view of

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.580
the network stack as shown here with these

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.280
interfaces. But it has a shared filesystem and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.470
it's not, in fact, running it's own independent

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.180
virtual machine. The root namespace manages the communication

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.650
between these distinct virtual nodes, as well as

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.140
the switch that connects these nodes in the topology that you set up. Virtual

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.220
ethernet pairs are assigned two name spaces.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.610
For example, S1 eth1 is assigned to an

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.870
interface in H2's network name space. And S1 eth2 is assigned to a network

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.910
name space in H3's virtual network name

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.090
space. The open flow switch effectively performs forwarding

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.760
between the interfaces in the root name

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.650
space. But because the interfaces are paired, we

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.680
get the illusion, of sending traffic, between h2

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.320
and h3. When we make modifications, to the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.230
open flow switch, via the controller we're infact

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.830
doing that in the root name space. In

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.020
summary, virtual networks facilitate flexible, agile deployment, by

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.840
enabling rapid innovation at the pace of software.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.140
Vender independence, and scale. We talked about the distinction

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.670
between SDN's and virtual networks, as well as various

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.130
technologies that enable virtual networks, such as virtual machines

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.750
for creating virtual nodes, and tunneling for creating virtual links.
