00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.755
So, to learn more about the different sections of Xcode, I went up to Help and

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:10.815
then clicked on Documentation, and started typing in Xcode Overview.

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:14.677
And the resulting help page provided a lot of good detail, including what

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:19.160
the names of these different sections within Xcode are actually called.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.970
By the way, an online version of this document is also available in

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.370
the instructor notes.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.020
Now, if I go back to my Xcode project,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.540
we can see that Xcode is divided into three main sections, the Navigator on

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.480
the left, the Editor in the middle of the screen, and the Utility on the right.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.240
Now, the Navigator, as the name suggests, allows us to browse through files.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.300
Here you can see that we are making this app for iOS 8.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.190
We are building this on iPhone and the device orientation of

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.230
the phone is Portrait, Landscape Left, and Landscape Right.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.300
For the sake of simplicity,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.075
however, I will only choose Portrait as the device orientation.

00:00:57.075 --> 00:00:59.570
Xcode created a few files for

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.080
us by default, one of which is called ViewController.swift.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.379
Let's check this one out.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.650
By the way, this code may be a little bit too small for

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.290
you to read, so let me make it a little bit bigger.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.280
That's much better.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.580
Notice that this file says it was created by Udacity.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.510
Now, this for you is probably the name that

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.720
you entered under organization while you were making this app.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.480
We are going to begin to write code in this file in just a few minutes.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.920
For now, I will click on Main.storyboard in the navigator.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.580
Now, you will notice that Xcode likes a lot of real estate, and these three

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.320
buttons here at the top right are very helpful with managing that real estate.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.950
For instance, this button helps us show and hide the Navigator.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.790
This button right next to it helps us show and hide the debug area, and

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.830
this is the place where you actually see error messages.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.079
And the final button here will show and hide Utilities.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.050
Okay, back to the Main.storyboard.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.850
Here is where we will actually draw the things that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.560
our user will see on the app.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.220
It is empty for now, but by the time we are done making this app,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.490
this is what the storyboard will look like.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.090
These storyboards can get really elaborate.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.010
For instance, here is a screen shot of what the storyboard for

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.650
the Udacity iPhone app looks like.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.320
Now, one thing to notice here is that this box on your

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.690
screen almost looks like a square.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.690
If you've done some work with Objective-C, another language which is used to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.420
make iPhone apps, you will notice that this is new.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.760
We can change the way this box looks by changing the width and

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.960
height settings here at the bottom of the screen.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.550
They currently say Any, which means that this layout works for

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.280
both iPhones and iPads.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.030
Since I'm making this app for the iPhone, I can change the layout here.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.560
Great. This looks a little bit more like the phone.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.550
Now, Xcode has a lot of other helpful features that we

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.640
will explore while making our app.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.030
For instance, we will talk about these buttons on the left,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.790
the cluster of these three buttons here on the right, and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.270
if I pull out the utility area, we'll also talk about these buttons here.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.000
If you're curious about any of these buttons right now,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.730
you can look at the handout that we have provided in the instructor notes.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.780
Before I end this tour, I have a challenge for you.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.770
I want you to explore Xcode and see if you can figure out

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.410
a way to run the current version of our app in a simulator inside your computer.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.780
Once you're done with that, I want you to see if you can figure out how to

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.900
check the CPU and memory usage for our app.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.080
As a quick hint,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.840
the answer is somewhere in the documentation listed in the instructor notes.
