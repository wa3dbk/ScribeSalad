Upon figuring out her shoe was untied, Lauren sought social support from her

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:08.472
friends and family. Often times we talk to our friends and family when we're

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:11.433
experiencing stressful events and it can help relieve some of the negative

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:16.790
emotional responses that we have. A second type of coping strategy is the one

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.614
that we see Lauren doing. And this is called emotion focus coping. One form of

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:26.704
that is seeking social support. With emotion focus coping we try to reduce the

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:31.810
emotional distress that we're experiencing. Now psychologists have come up with

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.010
at least six different ways in which we can use emotion focus coping, as tools

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.250
to reduce our stress. In addition to seeking social support, another

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.210
emotion-focused coping tool is distancing.
