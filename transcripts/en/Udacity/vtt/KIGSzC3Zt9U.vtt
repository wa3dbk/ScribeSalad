00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.232
The second possibility, the second strategy was Distributed Responsibility.

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:07.740
The ScrollBar receives the change requests and determines the new value, that,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.870
that is the relative, relative position in the ScrollBar tray.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.950
It also knows that the ViewPort depends on this information, so

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.292
it makes a method call passing the relative position to the ViewPort.

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:20.860
The ViewPort compares the relative position received to the current value

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.920
associated with the top displayed line, and realizes that it cannot

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.890
satisfy the responsibility. It formulates a request to the FileManager for

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.080
the additional lines. The FileManager component returns the lines to

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.870
the ViewPort for display, thereby reestablishing the invariant. That is,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.920
Knowledge of the invariant is distributed among three components that

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.740
delegate partial responsibility to each other when needed.
