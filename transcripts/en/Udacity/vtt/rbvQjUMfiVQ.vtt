00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.910
With jQuery, you'll be seeing the dollar sign a lot.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.970
But what is the dollar sign?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.980
Is it some special JavaScript keyword?

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.880
I'll press Enter, and, low and

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.190
behold, we see the exact same object that we saw before.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.080
As it turns out, the jQuery object and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.530
the dollar sign are mapped to the exact same thing.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.000
So, what is this dollar sign?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.530
The dollar sign is a character like any other.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.595
We could even reassign it as variable to something else if we wanted to.

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:34.760
For instance var $ equals cameron.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.190
And then when I type in the dollar sign and press Enter, we see cameron.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.120
With jQuery the dollar sign is just a pointer to the same JavaScript object we

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.510
saw before.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.290
In the spirit of making your front-end code easier to write,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.010
jQuery uses the dollar sign because because it's faster and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
easier to type than the whole word jQuery.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.940
In fact, some other JavaScript libraries use the dollar sign as well.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.730
For instance, the MooTools library also maps the dollar sign to a variable
