00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So, at this point, we know that the quote variable must have been set to true at some point.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Because initially it was false, but we already know that if it had stayed false,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
then the less than character would never have been added to the output.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So we now have deduce that quote must have been set,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and there is only one place in the program where quote is set, which is down here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So we can deduce that this long condition, which checks for quote,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
must have held at some earlier point before the less than sign.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Why must it have been true at some earlier point?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, because at the moment when symbols left was the less than sign

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
then the condition did not hold

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That simply assumed it was the character right before the less than sign

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
then the variable tag had never been set to true.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It was false from the beginning and it was false till the very end.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you look at this condition, what was the value of c and again over to you.
