00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.840
Did you get it?

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.719
&gt;&gt; Yeah I did actually. so, so this one

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.150
I think I understand completely. So we know that from

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.360
the last discussion we had about how you would recover

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.120
the joint, that what you're saying on the right of

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.850
this equation probability y times probability of x given y means that

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.020
the probability of y, the variable y doesn't depend on

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.320
anything. So, between those two graphs the one on the

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.500
right is the one where you're saying that. You don't

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.770
need to know the value of any other

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.890
variable in order to determine the probability of y.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.030
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.650
&gt;&gt; So it has to be the one on the sec, the second and just to make sure

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.230
if you look at the second product the probability

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.237
of x given y the second multican? Is it multican?

00:00:40.237 --> 00:00:41.817
&gt;&gt; Hm, factor.

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:45.150
&gt;&gt; Factor? Let's say factor. The second factor,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.240
this says that while you determine the probability

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.580
of x given the value of y and there is an arrow from y to x

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.810
so, the second one is in fact correct.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is actually just one way you could just read this

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.590
network is to say what is this node x with an arrow coming into it?

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.580
That is the probability of x. But, the, the things pointing into it are what's

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.459
exactly being given. What it's being conditioned

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.240
on. So that's exactly right, the second one.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.160
&gt;&gt; Right. So this, this, so this makes sense to me. This is why when

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.450
you look at a network, a Bayesian  network, it's very

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.350
hard not to think of them as dependencies.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.210
Even though they're not dependencies, they're conditional independencies.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.170
&gt;&gt; Well the arrows are a form of dependence but it's not a causal

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.670
dependence necessarily, it's it's again it's just

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.480
the way the probabilities are being decomposed.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.340
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.270
&gt;&gt; And the last of these three equations just Bayes rule,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.440
this time written correctly where the denominator has to be the probability

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.350
of x, and we've gone over this a couple of times. I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.700
don't, I don't need to, to describe it again, but what Would

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.210
like to, just, bring to your attention to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.350
this three together turn out to be kind

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.320
of our, you know, three musketeers in working

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.150
out the probability of various kinds of events.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.190
&gt;&gt; Excellent.
