00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.210
&gt;&gt; So in this problem, we are dealing with a two-dimensional grid, because here,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.900
two coordinates, x and y, are enough to represent any one point.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.700
In the real world, of course, problems are not that easy to represent, and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.610
one might need a multi-dimensional space in order to be able to represent all

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.020
the cases in the new problem. Let's examine a problem like that now.
