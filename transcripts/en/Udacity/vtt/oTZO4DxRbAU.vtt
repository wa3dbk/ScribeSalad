00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.879
Good job trying to match each construct with each operational definition. For

00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:09.852
depression, someone's score on the Beck's Depression Inventory, could be a way

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:14.781
of measuring and defining depression. For hunger, grams of food consumed. For

00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:19.831
stress, levels of cortisol, which is the stress hormone. For anger, this could

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:24.692
either be number of profanities uttered per minute or even ratio of minutes

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:29.722
spent smiling to minutes not smiling. The difference is that ratio of minutes

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:34.583
spent smiling to minutes not smiling would be a better measure of happiness.

00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:39.985
Because if it's greater than one then you're spending more time smiling. So the

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:44.698
higher this ratio, the happier you would be. So this would be a better measure

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.562
of happiness. So for anger, a better operational definition would be the number

00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:54.418
of profanities uttered per minute. Some operational definitions aren't so good,

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:59.737
but this is just an example. Health, could be resting heart rate. Obesity, body

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:05.046
mass index. Effort, minutes spent studying for an exam. And brand loyalty, the

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:10.305
number of products purchased per year from a particular brand. So these are all

00:01:10.317 --> 00:01:15.736
operational definitions which allow you to measure each of these constructs. And

00:01:15.748 --> 00:01:19.254
after being able to measure these constructs, we can analyze them.
