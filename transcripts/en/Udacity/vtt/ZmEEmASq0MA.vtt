00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.260
Now what we want to do is extract the

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.650
url. So we found this position, that's going to be

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.340
the value of start_link. Now our goal is to extract

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.160
this url. And the url starts from the first double

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.790
quote that we find after start link, and it

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.510
ends with the second double quote. So for the last

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.480
quiz of this unit, your goal is to write all

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.390
the code we need to end up finding that url.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.620
So this is going to be the hardest quiz that we've had so far. It's going to

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.040
involve you thinking about variables, thinking how

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.800
to use find in different ways. And write

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.920
several lines of code yourself. Think carefully

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.480
about how to do this. But I think

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.012
if you understand what we've covered so far, you'll be able to do this yourself.

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:45.179
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.203
So to be specific, here's the quiz, your goal is

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:51.519
to write Python code that assigns to the variable url.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.849
These are all lowercase letters, a string that is the

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:57.513
value of the first URL found on the page, in

00:00:57.513 --> 00:01:01.060
a link tag. So you should assume that we have

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.120
the variable page that's already initialized to the contents of

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.700
the page. And in your browser this will be initialized

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.320
to the contents of an example page. From the previous

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.510
quiz we also have the value of start-link already

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.150
worked out. It said start-link is the result of calling

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.800
find on page, passing in the string, a href

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.210
equals. And your goal is to finish this code, so

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.280
at the end of this code, the value of url is the first link on the page. And if

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.690
you print the value of url, and you've done

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.780
all the code correctly for the example that we provided,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.040
you should get the result http://udacity.com,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.610
which is the url that finds the Udacity webpage. So this is pretty tough quiz.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.340
There's a lot of steps. Think about it carefully. So it uses almost everything

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.370
that you've seen in the unit today. You'll

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.900
have to think about how to use the find

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.470
method, possibly passing in numbers as well as strings,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.170
as well as variables to keep track of things.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.040
To find the result, you'll also need to think about how to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.920
use the string indexing operators to select a sub-sequence of a string.
