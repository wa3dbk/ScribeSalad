00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.040
It's usually comforting to break down
a complex task into small doable steps.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.150
For instance,
build Tetris isn't a doable task so

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.190
let's try breaking it down a bit.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.129
One of the sub-tasks of building Tetris
would be to draw the tetrominos.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.390
Then we need to make
the tetrominos fall.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.080
Another aspect would be to make it so

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.210
that the tetrominos rotate when
you press the left or right keys.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.070
And another aspect of Tetris would be to
play a sound when a line in the field of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.370
play is complete.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.110
Especially if you're
newer to programming,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.170
this might just look like breaking down
one impossible thing into a whole bunch

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.970
of little impossible things.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.840
So, as lazy programmers,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.670
what do we do when we come
across an impossible problem?

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.390
Well, of course, we go find a library
that just does this for us.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.610
Actually, since there are a bunch
of capabilities that are often used

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.000
together in games,
we can usually find a game engine

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.850
that packages up a ton of libraries
into a whole system we can use.
