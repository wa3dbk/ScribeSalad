00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.502
People with post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD experience many intrusive

00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:10.241
symptoms that last at least one month. These include things such as recurring

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:15.521
intrusive thoughts, feelings or memories of the traumatic event. This can

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:19.996
happen while awake or while dreaming. A person may experience flashbacks, which

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:24.484
are vivid reactions that a person feels when they're experiencing the traumatic

00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:30.558
event over and over again. People with PTSD are easily startled, with hair

00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:37.337
trigger tempers. They may also be reckless or self-destructive. PTSD can occur

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:43.410
in both children and adults. And as we discussed in lesson six, many veterans

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.515
experience PTSD. In fact, some research shows that approximately 24% of war

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:55.225
veterans will experience PTSD. These veterans are also at greater risk of

00:00:55.225 --> 00:01:01.273
developing major depression, drug abuse and suicide after returning home. The

00:01:01.273 --> 00:01:05.604
death and despair of war induced PTSD is seen in a suicide note from an Iraq

00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:12.230
war veteran. In 2007, Daniel Somers was diagnosed with a traumatic brain

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.853
injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, Gulf War Syndrome, fibromyalgia, and a

00:01:16.853 --> 00:01:22.206
host of other medical problems. He sought treatment through therapy,

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:27.592
medication, music and film production. But eventually took his own life June

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:32.348
10th, 2013. He left behind a powerful suicide note. Here's part of what it

00:01:32.348 --> 00:01:37.934
said. All day, every day a screaming agony in every nerve ending in my body. It

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:41.886
is nothing short of torture. My mind is a wasteland filled with visions of

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:46.955
incredible horror, unceasing depression and crippling anxiety. Thankfully there

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:50.489
are treatments available for PTSD which we're going to talk about in our next

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:51.809
lesson.
