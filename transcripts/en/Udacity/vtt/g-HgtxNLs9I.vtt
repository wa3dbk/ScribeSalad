00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.810
For a second review problem, let's take a look at division of polynomials.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.686
We've learned two specific new strategies for determining all possible real and

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:13.584
complex zeros of a function. Let's next take a look at long division. Divide

00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:21.809
the following. 4 x squared plus 20 x plus 24 by 2 x plus 6.
