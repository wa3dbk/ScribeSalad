00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
All right, so the two choices are that it is an NP and it is NP hard, so it NP complete--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
4-colorability is NP complete, and the reasons are--well, so this one's true,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we can in fact quickly verify a certificate that list the color assignments.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We actually did that in general already earlier in the unit, so yeah, 4-colorability is definitely an NP.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's not necessarily an NP because the number of colors is bigger. Well, no.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The first argument is the correct one.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's not necessarily NP hard because having four colors to work with makes things easier.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That is kind of true--four colors does give you a little bit more slack

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and there's things that you can 4-color that you can't 3-color, but this argument

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is less compelling than the next argument that says that it is NP hard.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The reason for that is because the solution to 4 colorability solves 3 colorability.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So if you give me a graph and say--is this 3 colorable and to help you out,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'll give you an algorithm for solving 4 colorability.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
All I need to do is add a node to the graph, connect that node t every other node in the graph

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that means that that new node is going to have to have a different color

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
than everything else in the graph.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And now you say--okay, is this graph 4 colorable and if it is 4 colorable,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
then the color for this newly added node would be different from all the other ones,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so the rest of the graph has been 3 colored, so it actually solve 3 colorability,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and that's why knowing that 3 colorability is NP hard tells us 4 colorability is NP hard.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And, no no's. Since any graph that is 3 colorable is 4 colorable--that's true.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It doesn't make them equivalent because it would also have to go the other way,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
every 4 colorable graph would also have to be 3 colorable and that's just not true.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So this is actually the proof that 4 colorability is NP complete.
