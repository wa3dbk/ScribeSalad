00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.632
If we take out the factor of a from these two terms, the coefficient of the

00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:09.810
first term becomes one, and the coefficient of the second term becomes b over a.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.838
So we have a times the quantity x squared plus b over a x, and then, of course,

00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:16.417
plus c equals 0. Great.
