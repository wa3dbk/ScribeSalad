00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.900
One topic we didn't talk
about in the last lesson.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.860
Was where exactly NSUserDefault exists?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.090
Where is it being saved?

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.630
Where is anything being saved for
that matter?

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.510
To answer this, you have to take
a look at our devices file system.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.640
In this lesson,
we'll talk about the iOS file system and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.740
the concept of the sandbox.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.120
We'll then look at the basics of where
and how to access these files with code.
