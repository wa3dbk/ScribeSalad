Let's take a look at an example HTTP

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.880
request now. You can see here the request line,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.140
and here are some headers. Accept indicates that the

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.910
client's willing to accept any content type, that it

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.150
would like the content to be returned in English,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.500
that it can accept pages that are encoded in

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.580
particular, compression formats. We talked about the user agents.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.460
So in this case, its a Mozilla 5.0 browser.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.060
Here's the host, that the request, is being

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.530
made to. This is particularly useful in cases

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.240
where a particular web server IP address, might

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.030
be hosting multiple websites on the same server.
