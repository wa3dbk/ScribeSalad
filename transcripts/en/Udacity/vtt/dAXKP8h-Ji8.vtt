00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.010
This chart summarizes some of the discussion so far. Content deals with

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.700
the content of knowledge. Encoding deals with the representation of knowledge.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.000
Content and form. The content of knowledge can be visuospatial,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.710
that deals with what and where. Where is spatial, what is visual, and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.390
the encoding of the visuospatial knowledge could be either analogical or

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.070
propositional. An analogical inquiry of visuospatial knowledge is a structural

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.350
correspondence between the encoding and the external world that is being

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.000
represented. In the propository presentation of visuospatial knowledge, there is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.770
no such correspondence. Examples of this verbal knowledge include things like

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.320
scripts or going to a restaurant. The script for going to a restaurant again can

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.950
represented either propositionally or potentially analogically. And

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.670
a propository presentation of the kind we say we may have tracks and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.140
props and actors. In an analogical representation of the script for

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.160
going to a restaurant, we may have a short movie. In much of the codes,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.150
we have dealt with the right hand side of this chart with verbal knowledge and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.140
prepositional presentations. Part of the point of this lesson on visuospatial

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.530
knowledge and reasoning is that reasoning and knowledge can be visuospatial, and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520
representations can be analogical. But we have yet

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.390
to fully understand the role of human cognition and you [UNKNOWN] agents that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.500
can deal with visuospatial knowledge and analogical representation.
