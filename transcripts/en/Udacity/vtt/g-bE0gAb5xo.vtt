00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.100
So in packet monitoring, a monitor might

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.380
see the full packet contents, or at least

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.420
the packet headers that traverse a particular

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.550
link. Common ways of performing packet monitoring that

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.000
you may have tried yourself include tcpdump,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.770
ethereal, or wireshark. And in some of the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.140
exercises, you'll get a chance to Explore packet

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.370
monitoring with one of these tools. Sometimes packet

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.270
monitoring is performed using expensive hardware that can

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.340
be mounted in servers alongside the router that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.370
forward traffic through the network. In these cases,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.830
an optical link in the network is sometimes

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.440
split So that traffic can be both sent

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.340
along the network and sent to the monitor.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.520
Even though packet monitoring sometimes requires this expensive

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.440
hardware on very high speed links, what you do

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.850
when you run tcpdump or wireshark or ethereal

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.240
is essentially the same thing. Your machine acts as

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.260
a monitor on the local area network. And if

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.860
any packets. Hapen to be sent towards your network

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.000
interface. The network interface records those packets. Now on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.840
a switch network, you wouldn't see many packets that

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.580
weren't destined for your own mac address. But on

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.520
a network where there's a lot of traffic being

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.670
flooded, you might see quite a bit more

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.920
traffic destined for an interface that you're using

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.650
to monitor. So the advantages of packet monitoring

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.570
is that It provides lots of detail. You can

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.680
see timing information and information in the packet

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.180
headers. Unfortunately, a disadvantage is that it's fairly high

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.610
overhead. It is very hard to keep up

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.810
with high speed links and often requires a separate

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.620
monitoring device. Such as the monitoring card that we've shown here.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.860
What if we are happy with a little less detail, then packet

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.830
monitoring can provide. But we can't afford its overhead? In that case,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.450
there is actually another approach that we can use, called flow monitoring.
