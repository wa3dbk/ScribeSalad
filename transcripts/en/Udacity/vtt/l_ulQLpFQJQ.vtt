00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.600
So I'm going to describe that process, and I'm going to write it out

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.740
in a, fairly precise way, but not as actual python code. Because it

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.500
will end up being your job to finish the python code to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.460
do this. But I want to describe it precisely enough so we can

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.820
ask some questions about it. So we're going to start with some seed

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.970
page and to crawl will just be that page. The list containing just

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.530
the seed page, and crawled will be empty. And we're going to keep going

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.040
as long as there are more pages to crawl. And for each step

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.200
we're going to pick one of the pages, we'll add that

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.610
page to crawled to keep track of the fact that we've

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.030
crawled it. Then we'll find all the link targets on

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.880
this page, and add those to tocrawl, and we'll keep going

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.480
as long as there are more pages in tocrawl. And

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.110
then when we're done we'll return crawled. So that's the basic

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.630
process that I've walked through. So for this quiz. I

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.290
want to see that you understand the process that we're using

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.500
to crawl the web, well enough to understand what will happen

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.580
if we do this starting from the seed page on the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.730
example test site. And you can try exploring that site yourself.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.019
So the choices are, it will return a list of all

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.900
the URL's that can be reached starting from the seed page.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.430
The second choice it will return a list of some of

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.990
the URL's but not all of them that are reachable from

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.860
the seed page. And the third choice, it will never return.
