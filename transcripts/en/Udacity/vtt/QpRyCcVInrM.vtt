[Wes] Ok, I'm here at Mozilla, which is responsible for the Open Source Firefox web browser.

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:09.642
And it's also where we find Brendan Eich, the designer of JavaScript.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.942
Let's go in to learn more about that language.

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:17.761
So in this class we handle a very restricted subset of JavaScript.

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.676
For example, we don't pay very much attention, or any attention to the Document Object Model.

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:27.092
One question that one might have is: how really useful is to focus on a subset

00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:30.177
of Javascript or HTML.

00:00:30.177 --> 00:00:35.927
Can the skills that we'll learn in making a lexer, a parser, an interpreter for a smaller language

00:00:35.927 --> 00:00:38.838
carry over for important tasks in the real world.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:46.092
[Brendan]The answer is yes. Mozilla and other working browser in the Web

00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:49.427
often are doing with a subset of JavaScript.

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:53.642
There is a subset, not quite a subset, called JSON

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:56.426
that is quite popular, for describing trees of data.

00:00:56.426 --> 00:01:01.641
And it turns out that we want to parse JSON very quickly

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:08.792
in order to have Javascript to "eval()".

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:17.108
So, in our implementation we actually do a very quick subset's parse in the middle

00:01:17.108 --> 00:01:20.492
of line for JSON, because that's such a common case.

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:24.476
And if we can parse this JSON, which is asubset, JavaScript would be much more efficient.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:29.658
I also observed a lot of JavaScript libraries, that have almost 'query' in their name,

00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:34.442
are doing a sort of compiled generated functions that are optimized to match

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:37.792
certain queries against the Document Object Model.

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.892
And so there's co-generation going on.

00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:44.593
There are some partial evaluations going on, there is a subset of the language been used

00:01:44.593 --> 00:01:46.916
to construct simple matches and rules, for matching trees.
