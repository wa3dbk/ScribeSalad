00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.632
&gt;&gt; Now you saw that it's pretty complicated to calculate the standard deviation,

00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:08.975
but what's so great about it? Why don't we just find the average absolute

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:13.705
deviation? Why do we have to square each deviation, find the average square, and

00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:18.090
then take the square root? Doesn't it seem like a lot of extra complicated

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.174
steps? Well actually, the standard deviation is really cool, and it helps us a

00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:27.745
lot when we do statistical analysis. It turns out that with a normal

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:32.974
distribution, and if you remember, that's where the mean equals the median

00:00:32.974 --> 00:00:38.535
equals the mode, right in the center of the distribution, which is symmetrical,

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:44.078
the standard deviation has great properties. Approximately 68 percent of the

00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:49.287
data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean. So here's 1 standard

00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:55.317
deviation on each side, and I'm using the lower case sigma to represent standard

00:00:55.317 --> 00:01:01.572
deviation. So 68 percent of the data falls between this value, which is x bar

00:01:01.572 --> 00:01:07.672
minus 1 standard deviation, and this value, which is x bar plus 1 standard

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:14.017
deviation. And 95 percent of the data falls within 2 standard deviations. So

00:01:14.017 --> 00:01:20.737
this value here is x bar, the mean, plus 2 standard deviations, and this value

00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:26.957
is x bar minus 2 standard deviations. So 95 percent of the data will be between

00:01:26.957 --> 00:01:32.398
this value and this value. In fact, we can approximate how much data will lie in

00:01:32.398 --> 00:01:37.856
between any number of standard deviations from the mean. We know this because

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:43.400
some poor mathematician calculated this for us and put it all into a really nice

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.031
table. We're going to use this table a lot in the course, but not yet.
