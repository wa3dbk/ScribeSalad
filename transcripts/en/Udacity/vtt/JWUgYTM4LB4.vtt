00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.650
Health care industry is huge, and

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.415
there are a lot of data
coming out of health care.

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.290
U.S. health care is
incredibly expensive.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.700
Overall spending is $3.8
trillion in U.S. per year.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.780
That's more than the value of
ten biggest companies plus ten

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.730
Beijing Olympics plus a Warren Buffet,
and a Bill Gates.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.690
But does it have to be that way?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.230
There is massive waste in
health care unfortunately.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.390
The estimated waste in U.S.
healthcare alone is $765 billion.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.550
That's equivalent to the NASA's
total budget for the past 50 years.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.590
Not only the cost is an issue, but
also the quality of healthcare is poor.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.662
There are 200 to 400 thousand
preventable deaths per year in the U.S.

00:00:52.662 --> 00:00:55.093
That's 1,000 people per day.

00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:59.050
Four preventable deaths
occurred during this video.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.350
If we classify the preventable deaths
against other causes of deaths,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.270
it will be the number three causes
of deaths in the United States.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.310
After only heart disease and cancer.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.190
So, there are massive problems
presented in modern health care.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.350
Including high costs,
high waste, and low quality.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.200
How can big data help?

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.870
The hope is big data can lead
to better care and lower cost.
