Okay! Unit 3 homework. We've only got to do 1 thing in this homework,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and it is build a blog. [Chuckle]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Specifically, we want a front page that lists your entries--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it doesn't need to list all of the entries, but it should list at least the 10 most recent or so--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a form to submit new blog entries--this needs to check for errors to make sure

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
both fields--a title and a blog body--are present,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and if it is successful, it should redirect to a permalink page for the entries.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is just--a permalink is just a link to a specific entry.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And that's that! Let me give you a demo of what I'm expecting.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here is Udacity-cs253.appspot.com/blog. This is a blog I've made.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I only have 1 entry, and in this particular case, it's just "The Raven".

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We can go to /newpost if we want to enter a new post.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I can type in a title.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If I were to submit this form without a body, I would get an error message

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that requests both a title and a body,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and if I were to click submit with a title and a body,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I would get redirected to the permalink page, which just appears at some URL.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And we can see my title and the body,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and I can go back to the front page--/blog--and see, in my particular case,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the 10 most recent entries.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So, this is what I'd like you to build.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We've got more details in the description for this homework in terms of form parameters

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and all of the redirection handling things we're expecting,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and when you're done, submit the URL of your blog here.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Okay! Good luck!
