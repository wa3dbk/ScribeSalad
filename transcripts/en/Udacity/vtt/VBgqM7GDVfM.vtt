00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If we graph this with the probability as the horizontal axis and P(data) as the vertical axis.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then, for 1/2 we get a certain value. For 2/3, we get a larger value.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For 1/3, you might be down here. And for the extremes of 1 and 0, you end up down here in 0.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we effectively are getting a cliff but as we find out P is exactly at 2/3

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and goes to 0 in both extreme so this point, 2/3, is the one that maximizes the likelihood of the data.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Therefore, it's called the maximum likelihood data estimator or MLE.
