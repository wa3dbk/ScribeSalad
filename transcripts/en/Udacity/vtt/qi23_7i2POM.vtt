00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.590
Let's take a look at one last problem before we finish this lesson. I'd like you

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.122
to find the roots of the parabola y equals x squared plus 2x plus 10. I'd like

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:13.453
you to use the quadratic formula to do this, and get your values for x in the

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:17.383
form, so that there's just a single number in each of these boxes .
