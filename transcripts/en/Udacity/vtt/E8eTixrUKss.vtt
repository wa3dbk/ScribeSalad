00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.440
Now that we know we need to subtract 3 from both sides, what does x equal? We

00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:09.275
saw already, from simplifying expressions, that subtracting 3 from the left side

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:13.690
is going to get x by itself. But how does this affect the right side? Please

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:18.055
fill in this box right here with just one number that you think the right hand

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:18.922
side should be equal to now.
