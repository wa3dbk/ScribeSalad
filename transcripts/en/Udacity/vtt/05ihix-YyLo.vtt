00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.060
Hello, my name is Mustaque Ahamad.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.240
I'm a professor of computer
science at Georgia Tech, and also

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.630
a member of the Georgia Tech Institute
for Information Security and Privacy.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.050
I've been at Georgia Tech for 30 years.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.030
And it's been a great journey.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.040
My research interests are in computer
systems and system security.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.990
In addition to doing research and
teaching, I served as Director of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.370
the Georgia Tech Information
Security Center from 2004 to 2012.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.597
I also co-founded Pindrop Security that
is commercializing our research that we

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.328
did here in telephony security.

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:36.240
I'll be co-teaching this course
with Professor Wenke Lee.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.220
Both of us have taught this
course on our campus many times.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.200
We're delighted to bring this course
to all of you in this new format.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.790
The course,
Introduction to Information Security,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.930
provides a broad overview of
the field of cyber security.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.490
Unlike our adversaries who just have to
find one way to compromise our systems,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.940
we have to secure every
aspect of these systems.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.020
I'll be starting with topics
like software security.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.099
Operating system security,
database security and so on.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.000
Once I'm done with part one,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.600
we're going to move on to part
two with Professor Wenke Lee.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.117
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:12.325
My name is Wenke Lee.

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:15.380
I'm a professor of
Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.470
I'm also the co-director of
the Georgia Tech Institute for

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.330
Information Security and Privacy.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.598
My research interest are in systems and
network security, applied cryptography,

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:26.080
and data mining.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.840
I've also cofounded
company called Amala.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.040
It commercializes our
research in detection.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.500
I'll be covering the second
half of this course.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.470
The topics will include cryptography,
security protocols, network defenses,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.415
malware, web security,
and mobile security.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:46.360
Mustaque, I'm very excited about
bringing this course to students.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.030
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and by the time we
are done, hopefully they'll have great

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.330
understanding of the basic principles of
cyber security, and walk over lots of

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.260
practical techniques that help us
all stay safe in our online world.
