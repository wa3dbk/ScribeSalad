00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.600
We just learned that the square root of some number n can be written in exponent

00:00:05.612 --> 00:00:10.585
form as n to the 1 half power. That's great, that's super useful. What if

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:15.705
instead though, I have something y to the 5th, and I want to do something to

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:21.749
this using exponents that I end up with just y by itself, what exponent belongs

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:22.652
in this box?
