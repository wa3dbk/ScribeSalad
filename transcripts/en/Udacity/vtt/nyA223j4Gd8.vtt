00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.496
Most Android apps won't
live alone on the device.

00:00:03.496 --> 00:00:05.740
You'll probably want to talk
to your app at some point.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.029
And to do that you'll need a server.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.120
Now, I'm not going to walk you
through building a server.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.680
There are plenty of resources
out there for that.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.190
Instead, I'm going to show you how
to communicate with your server.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.240
So let's focus on how to get data
from your server to your app.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.410
The easy way,
which you're already familiar with,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.370
is known as polling the server.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.380
This is when your app
calls up the server,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.350
just to see if anything has changed.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.998
With a repeating alarm, the app does
this after a specified amount of time.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:34.027
But, with a sync adapter, it'll do
it whenever the radio is turned on,

00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:35.580
after some time has already passed.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.248
Sorry, let me just, there.

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:40.236
Sorry.

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:43.628
So, by waiting for the radio to be
activated by something else, we can

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:47.670
spare a bit of battery life, but that
requires a flexible timing schedule.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.310
So you need to determine what
your priorities are when choosing

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.660
a polling method.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.500
For example, in Sunshine, we poll
the weather servers every three hours,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.023
give or take,
to keep the weather data up to date.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.480
An alternative to polling
would be pushing.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.240
With this method, the server is
responsible for the messaging and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.266
will inform your app when
new data is available.

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.888
Your app doesn't need to regularly
check in with the server.

00:01:12.888 --> 00:01:15.260
Just, okay.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.031
Where was I?

00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:16.982
Oh yeah, pushing.

00:01:16.982 --> 00:01:18.306
Oh, pushing.

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:20.106
What a good idea.

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:21.545
Okay.

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:23.402
So pushing can happen in two ways.

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:26.397
Either the server can send a small
message called a tickle, which says

00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:30.230
something has changed and asks the app
to sync at its earliest convenience.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.680
Or, the server can just send the updated
data directly to the app and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.535
cut out the middleman.
