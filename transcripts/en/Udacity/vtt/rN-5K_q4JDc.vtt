00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:04.150
Ã¯Â»Â¿Student Hu asks about the complexities that are involved in the PageRank algorithm

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.367
that you went over in unit six is how similar is this to what Google does

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.853
or other search engines when they are ranking pages.

00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:12.615
So this is a good question. So the PageRank algorithm

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.627
that we described in unit six is exactly what Google started with

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:21.002
and this was the research paper that Larry Page and colleagues wrote

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.508
about how they would improve search ranking

00:00:23.508 --> 00:00:26.374
and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s exactly the algorithm that we implemented in unit six

00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:28.578
and that was what Google was doing in its early days.

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:30.864
Things are a lot more complicated today

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:34.065
and a lot of the reason for that is well, sites adapt.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:37.326
And youÃ¢Â€Â™d remember Anna Patterson was taking about how sites adapted

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:41.015
to the way AltaVista was ranking by putting lots of copies of the same word

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.644
on the page to try to show up top in the rankings

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.657
and this started to make the results less useful.

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:49.866
Sites have also adapted to PageRank by trying to find ways to get links to the page,

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:54.361
have their own pages linked to their own other pages that look different to Google,

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:57.370
making it so there are lots of in links and trying to make it

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.859
so you get a high rank in the page

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.204
and there is entire consultants whose business is try to find ways

00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:05.200
to get your page higher ranked in Google.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.307
So that means that for PageRank to continue to work,

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:11.015
well they have to take into account more things, so they look at things like

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:13.906
how things appear on the page, they look at other context,

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:17.282
they look at other information, not just the link structure.

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:21.674
But thatÃ¢Â€Â™s still the basis for a lot of Ã¢Â€Â“ the ranking of the pages is the link structure.

00:01:21.674 --> 00:01:26.592
And you can see evidence of PageRank on kind of what the search results you get

00:01:26.592 --> 00:01:29.103
when you are using Google, itÃ¢Â€Â™s very, very common that Wikipedia

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:31.936
is one of the top three results on almost anything you search for

00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:34.426
and thatÃ¢Â€Â™s because a lot of people link to Wikipedia

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:38.439
because it has got authority but also that Wikipedia links to itself a lot.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.248
That kind of a structure helps.

00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:42.968
Yeah, hundreds of pages link to other higher pages.

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.399
And itÃ¢Â€Â™s also that content of the pages is also high quality

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.156
and there is things that Google is trying to do to measure the quality of pages as well.

00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:51.000
Yes.
