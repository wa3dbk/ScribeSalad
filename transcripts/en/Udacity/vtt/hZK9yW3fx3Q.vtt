00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.630
So now that we have seen that unrolling can really help both reduce the overall

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.570
work, and also schedule the work better. We might be tempted to do unrolling all

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.200
the time. So is there any downside to unrolling? Well, yes there is. So

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.810
first there is code bloat.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.430
Let's say that our original body was four instructions. After we unroll, for

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.190
example it might be that instructions one through three,. Need to be replicated,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.520
and this is for example our branch, so we can just have one. So now there is

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.500
fewer instructions executed per original iteration. We had four per iteration,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.550
now we have seven per two iterations. But the code size is much larger. Here we

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.790
had four instructions in a our code, now we have seven instructions in our code.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.630
If we decide to unroll more than once, meaning. Do the work of let's say,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.700
four of these iterations. The code size will be proportionally larger.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.570
So the code grows quickly, with the number of un-rollings with we do. Second,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.950
what if the number of iterations is unknown at the beginning? For example,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.800
this could be a while loop. In that case, here, we do one iteration at a time.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.480
Here we're doing two iterations at a time. What if we needed to exit here?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.540
Even in a four loop where we know the number of iterations in advance.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.538
What if the number of iterations we need is not a multiple of N?

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:19.156
The number of iterations we are doing per iteration of the loop. So

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:22.650
we might still for example, we might need to do seven iterations of this loop.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.580
We unroll it once. Now we need to do this three times and then exit in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.560
the middle. So, how do we handle this? The solutions to this problems do exist,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.750
but they are beyond the scope of this class. So, these are questions that

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.900
are better answered in advanced compiler class, not in an architecture class.
