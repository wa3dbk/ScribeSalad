00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.660
To see how see how a DNS cache

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.850
poisoning attack works, consider a network where a stub

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.440
resolver issues a query to its recursive resolver, and

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.720
the recursive resolver in turn sends that A record

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.309
query to the start of authority for that

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.480
domain. Now, in an ideal world, the authoritative name

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.320
server for that domain Would reply with the correct

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.460
IP address. If an attacker guesses that a recursive

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.080
resolver might eventually need to issue

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.070
a query for say, www.google.com. The attacker

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.260
can simply reply with multiple, specially crafted.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.900
Replies each with different id's. Although this

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.960
query has some query id, the attacker doesn't need to see that query because

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.520
the attacker can simply flood the recursive resolver with a bunch of bogus

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.870
replies and one of them, in this case the response with id3 will match. As

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.610
long as this bogus response reaches the recursive

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.129
resolver before the legitimate response does, the recursive

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.710
resolver will accept this bogus message. And

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.700
worse, it caches the bogus message. And DNS,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.400
unfortunately, has no way to expunge. A message

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.550
once it has been cached. So now this

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.310
reclusive resolver will continue to send bogus

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.530
A record responses for any query for

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.020
this particular domain name until that entry

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.050
expires from the cache. Now there's several defenses

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.900
against DNS cache poisoning, and we've already seen one, which is the query ID.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.910
But of course, the query ID can be guessed. The next defense is to randomize

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.190
the ID so rather than having a resolver, end queries where

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.080
the ID's increment in sequence, the resolver can pick a random

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.490
ID. This makes the ID tougher to guess, but still,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.600
the query ID is only 16 bits, which still makes it possible for

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.330
an attacker to flood the recursive resolver with many

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.620
possible responses. And, it's likely that, with

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.050
relatively few responses, One of these bogus

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.160
responses will match the ID for the real query. Due to the birthday paradox,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.500
the success probability for achieving a collision

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.595
between the query ID of the query

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:28.840
,and of the response actually only requires

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.700
sending hundreds of replies, not a complete 32,000.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.410
Due to the birthday paradox, The probability that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.810
such an attack will succeed, using only a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.520
few hundreds of replies, is relatively close to

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.770
one. The attacker does not need to send

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.780
replies with all two to the 16th possible

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.000
IDs. The success of a DNS cache poisoning

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.420
attack not only depends on the ability to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.230
reply to a query with a correct matching ID,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.050
but it also depends on winning this race. That is, the attacker must reply

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.810
to that query before the legitimate authoritative

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.180
name server replies. If the bad guy, or

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.910
the attacker, loses the race, then the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.090
attacker has to wait for that correct cached

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.460
entry to expire, before trying again, however

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.770
the attacker can generate his own DNS query.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:30.180
For example, he could query one.google.com, two.google.com and so forth. Each

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.950
one of these bogus queries will generate a new race. And eventually the attacker

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.430
will win one of these races for an A record query. But who

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.384
cares? Nobody necessarily cares to own

00:03:44.384 --> 00:03:47.780
one.google.com, or google.com. The attacker really wants

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.450
to own the entire zone. Well the trick

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.990
here is that instead of just simply responding

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.080
with A records in the bogus replies. The

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.950
attacker can also respond with NS records for

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.510
the entire zone of google.com. So by creating

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.660
one of these races, using an A record

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.320
query, and then responding not only with the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.340
A record response, but also with the authoritative

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.750
of the NS record,for the entire zone. The attacker can in fact own the entire

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.690
zone. This idea of generating extreme of A record queries to generate a bunch of

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.960
races and then stuffing the A record responses for each of these with a bogus

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.220
authoritative NS record for the entire zone. Is

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.740
what's called the Kaminsky Attack, after Dan Kaminsky,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.410
who discovered the attack. The defenses of

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.610
picking a query ID and randomizing the ID,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.280
help, but remember the randomization is only 16

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.880
bits, so let's think about other possible defenses.
