00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Congratulations! You've finished something really complex.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You've made your own bar charts, your own histograms, and your own scatter plots.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Isn't this a lot of fun? Isn't statistics really great?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Did you learn that by just looking at data, you can already understand a lot.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So the purpose of this unit was to empower you to instruct the computer to plot data,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the reason why I told you this is because the very first step every statistician does

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is to look at the data if you're given data.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now on the next unit, I will give you something that'll bend your mind.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I will give you data that depending on how you look at it

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
will get you a very different conclusion.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Stay tuned and check out the next unit where I will bend your mind.
