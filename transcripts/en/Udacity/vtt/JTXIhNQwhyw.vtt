00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.026
The predictor that fixes the two mis-predictions per anomaly behavior of the one

00:00:05.026 --> 00:00:10.205
bit predictor is called a two bit predictor. Often we write that as

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:15.550
2BP,or even a 2BC which stands for

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.460
a 2-bit counter. We will see that this predictor behaves like a 2-bit counter.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.115
The 2-bit predictor has possible values zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, and

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:30.460
one, one. The way it works, is that the more

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.680
significant bit of the predictor tells us what the prediction should be.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.230
So this is what we will call the prediction bit, the more significant bit of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.835
this predictor. This prediction bit really functions similarly to.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:49.210
How the 1-bit predictor functions. This lower bit, here,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.740
is called the Histeresis or Conviction Bit. This tells us

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.630
how sure are we that we should be predicting what the prediction bit is saying.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.390
Usually, the state zero, zero is treated as a strong not-taken state.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.270
This means that we will be predicting not taken. And

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.930
we are fairly convinced that not taken is the dominant behavior of this branch.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.300
The zero one state will be the weak not taken prediction state.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.500
Were still going to predict not taken but

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.610
this time we are less sure that that's the dominant behavior. Similarly here for

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.050
the, predict taken, states we have, Weak Taken, and the Strong Taken state.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.203
So how does this predictor work? The 1-bit predictor only had the, not-taken and

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:45.230
the taken state. If, our state is zero, we will predict not-taken.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.070
If we indeed see the not-taken decision later, we stay in this state.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.600
Next time we'll predict not-taken too. If however, we're predicting not-taken,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.950
but this decision turns out to be taken, we change our mind and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.310
move to the taken state. In the taken state, we stay there if the branches

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.610
in it taken, but if we predict taken and see that the branch is not-taken,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.550
we go back to the not-taken state and state predicting that. So pretty much,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.740
one outcome changes our mind completely about what to do with a branch.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.830
And that has resulted in two mis-predictions per anomaly.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.980
let's say that the dominant behavior is not-taken, the first time the branch

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.740
is seen to be taken we move here and then the branch moves back to the dominant

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.330
behavior we will predict taken and mis-predict again before we move here.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.770
With 2-bit predictor we have four states. Zero zero, zero one,

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.360
one zero, and one one. Now this is our strong not-taken state. And

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.070
of course if we see a not-taken decision we stay there. We were convinced

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.540
that the branch will be not taken and the outcome really confirms that.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.260
If we see a single taken decision from the strong not taken state we move to

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.250
the weak not taken. So now we're predicting that the branch is still not-taken,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.540
but we are less convinced about that. In the case when the not-taken behavior is

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.712
the dominant one this would be the anomaly and we would move back to the strong

00:03:14.712 --> 00:03:19.610
not-taken state. Once we see that the branch is not-taken, so the idea is that,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.380
unlike here, where the anomaly itself will result in a mis-prediction, and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.620
then we will predict differently so

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.170
that the dominant behavior again will be mis-predicted for once.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.450
Here, this taken while in the strong not-taken state will be a mis-prediction.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.550
But then, we will predict not-taken. It's just a weak prediction. So we will be

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.410
right for this not-taken outcome. So if the branch really is mostly not-taken,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.400
we only have a mis-prediction. When the anomaly happens, not also,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.540
not when the dominant behavior happens after the anomaly. Similarly,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.550
if we are in the strong taken state, we believe now that the taken behavior

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.300
is the dominant one. A single not taken will result in a mis-prediction, but

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.770
move us to a weak taken state. So that if we see a taken outcome again,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.910
we don't mis-predict and we move back to the strong taken state.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.260
Of course we stay in the strong taken state as long as we are seeing the taken

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.360
outcome. So the idea is that if not-taken is a dominant behavior, we expect

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.600
the predictor to stay in these two states. If taken is the dominant behavior, we

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.350
expect the predictor to stay in these two states. Either way, it's predicting so

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.510
that only the anomaly gets mis-predicted, but not the dominant behavior that

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.750
follows the anomaly. However, we can have a branch that, for example,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.070
tends to be not-taken for a while, and then changes its mind about it and

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.200
starts being taken for a while. Thus, if we are in the weak taken state, and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.120
we see another taken outcome, we will go to one of the taken states,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.050
and similarly, if we are in a weak taken state, and we see another not-taken,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.730
we will move to one of the not taken states. So, the idea is,

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.940
if we see a branch that is mostly not taken. Periodically it's maybe taken and

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.600
then again stays not taken. We stay in these two states and keep predicting not

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.350
taken. But if the branch starts being taken very often from now on,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.210
it will take one, two mis-predictions before we are in the taken states and

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.095
start predicting taken again. So somehow, a single anomaly will cost us one

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:35.840
mis-prediction. A switch in behavior will cost us two mis-predictions. So

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.480
why we call this a 2-bit counter is because if you look at what this is doing,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.690
is, it's a counter that counts up. When the branch is taken, and

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.540
saturates at three. And counts down when it's not-taken, and

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.920
saturates at zero. So really it's a 2-bit counter that just

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.260
counts up when the branch is taken, and counts down as the branch is not-taken.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.700
This also means that this is a relatively easy behavior to implement.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.020
Basically it's very easy to implement this type of predictor
