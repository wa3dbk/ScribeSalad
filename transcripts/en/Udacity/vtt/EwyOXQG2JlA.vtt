00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.830
You can use OCL for a variety of voices. You can specify invariants on classes

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.450
in your class model diagrams. You can describe pre and post conditions on

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.330
the operations, in your diagrams. You can specify derivation rules for

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.800
derived attributes. Remember them? You can describe guards on transitions

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.290
in statecharts. You can specify the targets for messages and

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.650
actions, you can speci, specify type invariants for

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.600
stereotypes, which we'll describe a little bit later. You can even use it

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.550
as a query language. Class model diagram is describing a set of.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.090
Possible instances, and you might wish to query those instances for

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.550
certain things, OCL can be used as a query language in that sense.
