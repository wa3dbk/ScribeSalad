Have you ever thought about how language can effect our thoughts or

00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:08.455
perceptions? If you're like many of us, we often take language for granted. For

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:11.380
example, have you ever been in a situation where everybody else around you was

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.268
speaking a different language and you didn't understand? Or perhaps you've been

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:19.587
sick and lost your voice. You can appreciate how difficult it is to

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:24.055
communicate. However, we do have other ways to communicate. Such as through

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:28.930
gestures, writing or typing, or even american sign language. I'd like to you to

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.450
take a moment and think about what it would feel like, if you were in a

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.285
situation where everybody else was speaking a different language that you

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:38.680
didn't understand. Chances are you will feel isolated.
