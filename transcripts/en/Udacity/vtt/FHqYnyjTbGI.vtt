Our answer is 3 4th. We can rewrite what's inside the parenthesis here as x to

00:00:05.812 --> 00:00:09.075
the 1 4th power, that's what we want to cubed. From here, we can use one of

00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:14.525
those lovely shortcuts we talked about earlier. This is the same as x to the 3

00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:18.800
times 1 over 4, which is the same as x to the 3 4th.
