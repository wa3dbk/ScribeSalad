Now, what type of function is each graph representing?

00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:06.330
One of them is a constant function,
one of them is a linear function,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.722
one a quadratic function,
one an absolute value function,

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:13.542
one a cubic function,
and one a square root function.

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:20.695
Please place the letter of the graph that goes with each of these types of functions in the box next to it.
