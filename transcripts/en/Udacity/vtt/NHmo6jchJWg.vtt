If we want to define the set Fruit like we did before,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we can write the following, and when I print Fruit I get the following.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Notice that I could have included apple twice,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and when I print I get the exact same thing because sets don't take duplicates into account.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I can also print the set Vegetable and notice that the order that I defined this set in

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is not necessarily the order that it gets printed in. Sets don't care about order.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Once we've defined these sets, we can check for membership.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For example, maybe I want to know if apple is in the set Fruit,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and when I run this statement I get a true.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Apple is in Fruit.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Sense apple is not in Vegetable, this statement gives me False.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
For a quiz, what's going to be the output when I print this statement:

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
fruit--with a vertical bar--vegetable? Select the best option.
