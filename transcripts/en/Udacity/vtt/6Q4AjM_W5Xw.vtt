00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.930
The right answer, either SPIN or monolithic, will result in the least number of

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.771
border crossings. Why? In the microkernel based

00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:12.229
structure, we're assuming that each one of

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:17.070
these services are available as server processes.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.350
In their own hardware address space and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.360
therefore any system service that an application

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.710
needs may have to go through multiple

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.540
border crossings. And by border crossing we, of

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.250
course, mean going across different address spaces and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.075
the incumbent loss of locality that it entails.

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:39.630
Whereas, in the case of mono, you have

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.970
only two border crossings. One to get to

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.630
the monolithic kernel and the other to come

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.440
out back into the application. And by construction,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.050
in SPIN also, because we are taking SPIN and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.551
extending it with the services. They're all

00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:57.450
contained in the same hardware address space.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.890
So, even though we may be going

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.390
through several different protection domains in satisfying the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.730
system call emanating from an application. Those

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.750
prediction domains are all logical prediction domains.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.070
It does not involve border crossing that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.670
entails change of locality and loss of performance.
