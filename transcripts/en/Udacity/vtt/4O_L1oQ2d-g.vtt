00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So now for your homework, go and extend my spyder with the following commands--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we have s step one line--this is already in there, we have c for continue execution,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and we have quit--this is already in there.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now come the extra command--we have p for print all variables and also with an extra argument,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which should print the variable as variable equals value.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We want to have commands to set breakpoints--b at line sets a breakpoint in line,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
meaning that after you enter this command, execution will always stop

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
whenever that line is reached, and finally, special command and is specially useful--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
if you typed in w for watch point or anything that starts with w such as watch

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and give a variable name as argument, then the program should stop

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
whenever the variable changes its value.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
With these commands, you can actually go and debug the remove HTML markup function

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
step by step, printing out individual variables, but as we discussed today,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you should go and use the scientific method for your homework.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We will test your debugger by coming up with commands such as these

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and of course, expecting very specific output.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is an extra part that will not be graded, which you can do just for fun.
