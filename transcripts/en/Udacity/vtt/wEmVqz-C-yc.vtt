00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.500
The last practice I want to mention is on-site customer, and what

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.590
that means is that literally the customer is an actual member of

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.310
the team. So the customer will sit with the team and will

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.546
bring requirements to the team and discuss the requirements with them. So

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.461
the typical objection to this practice is the fact that it's just

00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:19.640
impossible in the real world. There is no way that the customer

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.550
can have one person staying with the team all the time, and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.130
the answer to that objection is that if the system is not

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.700
worth the time of one customer then maybe the system is not worth building. In

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.530
other words, if you're investing tons of

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.440
dollars, tons of money in building a system,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.870
you might just as well invest a little more and have one of the people

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.080
in the customer's organization stay with the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.450
team and be involved in the whole process.
