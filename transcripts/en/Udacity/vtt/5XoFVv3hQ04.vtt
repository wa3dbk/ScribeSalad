00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 8.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The easy way to see that is to observe that 15 is 3  5.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That's a composite number that can be broken down into two primes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then if we look at the numbers from 1 to 14--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
these are all the positive integers less than n--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we want to figure out how many of these are relatively prime.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The multiples of 3 are not. You can cross all those out.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
true for the multiples of 5 as well.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The multiples of 5 are not.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That leaves us with eight numbers.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This works in general. If we know that n is the product of two primes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then we could compute φ(n).

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's the number of integers less than n,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
which is also pq - 1. That would be all the integers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Then we subtract out all the multiples of p that are less than n.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Since n is pq, there are q - 1 of those.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Then we want to subtract all the multiples of q less than n,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which is again pq, so there are p - 1 of those.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If we do the algebra, we get pq - (p + q) +1,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which we could also write as (p -1)(q - 1).

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Since p and q are prime--and this property depended on q being prime.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Otherwise, some of these multiples might have collided.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Since they are prime, we know they didn't.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That means that we know that φ(n) is equal φ(p)φ(q).

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is going to turn out very useful for RSA.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The reason for that is if we know the factors of n,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
we have an easy way to compute the value of φ(n).

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But if we don't know the values of p and q,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
it appears to be hard to compute the value of φ(pq).

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
That's the crux of what the security of RSA relies on,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and we'll talk more about that later.

00:01:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For now we're still focused on correctness.
