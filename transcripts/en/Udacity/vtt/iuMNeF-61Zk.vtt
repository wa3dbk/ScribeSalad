00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.060
In this lesson, we've seen that there
are some problems that we can not

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.440
compute in a traditional
programming language like Python.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.170
But somehow this feels
a bit unsatisfying,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.160
since all we showed was there
are more problems to solve than there

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.140
are computer programs to solve them.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.120
But we haven't actually given
you any specific problem

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.510
that can't be solved on a computer.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.680
The set of problems with finite
descriptions accountable, so

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.170
at this point we haven't even ruled out

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.620
that every problem we can describe
we can solve in a computer.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.200
Turns out this isn't the case,
there's some very natural problems that

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.270
cannot be solved by computers,
now or ever.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.020
To get to that point we need more tools.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.900
We need to find some model of
computation simple enough to study yet

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.490
powerful enough to capture
everything we mean by computing.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.550
In the next lecture we
do exactly that and

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.390
introduce you to
the wonderful Turing machine.
