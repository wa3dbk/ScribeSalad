00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.990
That concludes our lessons max
matching in bipartite graphs.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.570
If the topic of matchings
is interesting to you.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.160
I suggest exploring
matchings in general graph

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.250
instead of just the bipartite
ones we studied here.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.070
And also taking a look at minimum cost

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.100
bipartite matchings in
the Hungarian algorithm.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.060

in the instructor notes.
