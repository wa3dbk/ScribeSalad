00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.220
We just said that the slope of a line is equal to its increase in the y

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:09.105
direction divided by its increase in the x direction. Here are two new points

00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:14.096
that I've drawn for us, 1,7 and 5,3 and I've drawn the line that runs through

00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:18.962
both of them. Notice that instead of pointing up and to the right, this line is

00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:23.967
pointing down to the right and this affects the slope of this line in some way.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:28.762
Thinking about that, what can we say about the slope of this line? Is it a

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:33.557
fraction, is it positive, is it negative, is it not defined, or is it zero?
