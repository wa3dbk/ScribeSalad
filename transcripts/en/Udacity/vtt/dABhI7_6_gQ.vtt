00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.560
So let's do a quick check of our

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.460
knowledge of benchmarks and performance reporting. Which of

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.650
the following uses code from real applications, but

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.760
does not use all of the code from any

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.738
of, of the applications? The choices are, the

00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:15.958
actual workload mix from the user? An application

00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.824
suite? An application kernel? Synthetic benchmarks? And peak

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:24.670
performance reporting? Select all of those that satisfy this.
