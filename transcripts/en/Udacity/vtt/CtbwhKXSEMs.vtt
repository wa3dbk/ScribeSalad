00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.162
Well, since this value is one standard deviation above the mean, 13 plus 4.8 is

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:14.657
17.8. If we add another 4.8, we get 22.6. And similarly, if we subtract 4.8 from

00:00:14.657 --> 00:00:21.928
13, we get 8.2. And then subtract another 4.8 to get 3.4. So here's our normal,

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:24.933
unstandardized distribution.
