00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.082
This problem deals with mailing a package. The price for mailing a package

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:08.538
varies directly with its length and its width. This should make sense, since the

00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:12.198
larger something is, the more money and work that it would take to ship it

00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:16.388
across the country or even the world. So if it costs $20 to ship a package that

00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:20.692
measures 4 feet and weighs 10 pounds. How much would it cost to mail a package

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:24.988
that measures 7 and a half feet, and weighs 15 pounds? Write that price here and

00:00:24.988 --> 00:00:28.763
don't worry about putting your dollar sign. I have it written for you.
