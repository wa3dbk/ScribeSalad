00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.360
So let us look at the semantic network representation of the relationship

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.630
between A and B. In one view of the transformation from A to B,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.690
we can think of q, the outer circle, as remaining unchanged, and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.790
p the inner circle, as getting deleted. Let's look at

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.250
another view of the transformation from A to B. In this view, we can think of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.200
p as getting expanded and q, the outer circle, as getting deleted.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.800
Both of these views are valid views. If both of these views are valid,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.120
then how would anyone decide? How would an AI agent decide which view to select?

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.300
Let us suppose that the AI agent had a metric by which it could

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.290
decide upon the ease of transformation from A to B.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.680
Let us suppose that, that metric assigned different weights to different kind of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.320
transformations. You will notice that these transformations like scaling,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.600
rotation, reflection make for a fine transformations. In this scale,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.640
a larger value like 5 points, means more ease of transformation and

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.970
greater similarity. A lower value means less ease of transformation and

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.710
more difficult transformation and less similarity. Given the scale,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.810
let us calculate the weight of transformations for

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.090
both transformation #1, and transformation #2. In transformation #1,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.440
you can see that p is getting deleted, which we gave a weight of 1. And

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.934
q remains unchanged, which we gave a weight of 5. So the total weight here is 6.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.850
In case of transformation #2, the weight of p being expanded, we said will be 2,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.800
scaled. And, q getting deleted is 1, so the total weight is 3.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.530
If you prefer the first transformation over the second transformation,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.930
then we can see why someone will answer the square is the correct answer, and

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.020
not the triangle. Let us return to this exercise. And now we can see why

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.990
both 3 and 5 are legitimate answers. We can also see why an AI agent

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.090
may prefer 5, given the similarity metric that we talked about in the last shot.
