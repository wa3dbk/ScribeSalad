00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.500
Now that you've learned about data types I want you to take a look at

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.340
this image, which is linked in the instructor notes.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.450
I've gone ahead and identified the different variables in this visualization,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.320
but what I want you to do is identify it through data types.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.620
For example, is this variable, doctor visits per year, a nominal data type,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.360
an ordered data type or a quantitative data type?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.870
Choose one of these for each of the variables.
