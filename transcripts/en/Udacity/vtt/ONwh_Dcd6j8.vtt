First of all, where does 5 fall on our distribution? Here, in between 3.4 and

00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:11.232
8.2. How many standard deviations below the mean is that? Looks like about 1.5

00:00:11.232 --> 00:00:16.832
or somewhere in between 1 and 2. So that's important. To keep in mind when we

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:22.372
use the z table. So what we need to do first is figure out exactly how many

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:28.127
standard deviations 5 is from 13. How far is 5 from 13? It's 8 away. And how

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:34.166
many standard deviations of 4.8 fit into 8? This is negative 1.67 if we round to

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:40.098
the nearest hundredths place. And remember, it's negative because 5 is less than

00:00:40.098 --> 00:00:45.045
the mean. So now we can bring up our z table. So here's the z table. And I

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:50.479
shared it with you in the link at the bottom. So we have negative 1.6 here. And

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:56.901
for negative 1.67, we find where this row and this column, intersect. And that's

00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:03.585
here at 0.0475. So if we look at our distrubution, then the proprotion less than

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:10.096
5 is 0.0475. That means that a little less than 5% of students have gotten less

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:12.945
than 5 points per post on average.
