Now, let's think of another thing that we
can count. How about something simple like

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:09.510
cupcakes. Let's say that one of your
friends bakes a bunch of cupcakes for your

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:15.102
birthday party. He bakes 50 cupcakes. You
are a very popular person. So a ton of

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:20.030
people come and the cupcakes are really
delicious, so pretty much everyone eats at

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.255
least one. Halfway through the party
people start coming up to you and asking

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:28.951
you how many cupcakes are left. You look
around and realize that you can't seem to

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:34.153
find any cupcakes anywhere. They must have
all been eaten. Can you tell your friends

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:40.816
that there aren't any cupcakes left using
a natural number? Please pick yes or no.
