00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.450
There are a few more methods that D3 defines on a selection object that allow

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.960
you to transform and mutate DOM nodes.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.070
If you're curious about all the possible options,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.010
I suggest reading through D3's API docs on their site, or

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.500
by simply exploring the selection objects using Chrome's autocomplete.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.160
In this case,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.480
I'm going to store the return value of the selection into a variable header.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.860
And now with my header dominoed, I can try to call a function on it and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.510
see what the Chrome console tries to autocomplete.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.880
Calling header dot shows not only the functions D3 defines but

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.080
any function I could possibly call on the object I'm working with.
