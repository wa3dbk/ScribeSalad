00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.346
Whenever we write the solution to a quadratic equation, we write it as a set. X

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:08.943
could equal negative 3, or x could equal negative 2. Use curly braces on the

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:13.170
outside, and commas between the elements. You'll also notice that I listed the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.023
negative 3 first. By convention, we list the numbers from least to greatest.
