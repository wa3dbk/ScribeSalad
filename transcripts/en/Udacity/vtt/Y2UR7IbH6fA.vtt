00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.990
Pq of x is a parabola. Thinking about the graphs of p and q, this makes sense.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.702
Since they are both linear functions, if we multiply two linear expressions

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:14.700
together, we get a quadratic one, which produces a parabola. We can also see

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.795
this in the table, the curve starts down low at negative 5, comes up, and then

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.949
drops back down again. Let's look at its actual graph.
