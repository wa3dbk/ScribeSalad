00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.580
So the, these three conditions that Jared has come up with

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.830
about whether it's available, whether it hasn't been requested by somebody else

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.619
and the one that we had before concerning age correspond to three conjuncts.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.100
You know, three, three possibilities that all must hold. And

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.560
as we talked about a minute ago we could have three separate preconditions, or

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.270
we could have one precondition with three, with, with two ands separating

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.300
the three parts of it. The other thing to note in the expression of it is.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.950
We've use some new operation names, in expressing it.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.798
So we said, is available. Now, is available is not one that came

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:55.800
out of the process of building the [UNKNOWN] class diagram. But that's okay.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.110
It's like. Breaking the writing of a a method into, into pieces and

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.390
calling other methods along the way. Okay it's, it's just divide and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.580
conquer. So, we're going to assume we can invent the names of these convenient

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.800
operations. And, that simplifies the, not only the writing here, but

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.080
the reading as well, if we're trying to show the requirements to the customer.
