00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.660
Let's take a closer look
at each round of AES.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.189
Again, in AES,
data is represented as state array.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.460
The first operation is substitute bytes.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.370
This involves using S boxes to
perform byte by byte substitution.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.910
And again,
the result is stored in the state array.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.820
The second operation is shift rows.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.960
And this is permutation
that's performed row by row.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.060
Again, the result is in the state array.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.140
MixColumns is a substitution that
alters each byte in a column

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.400
as a function of all
the bytes in the column.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.140
Again, the result is in the state array.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.480
And then we XOR with the round key.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.030
The result is in the state array, and
this feeds to the next round of AES.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.380
As you can see, each round of AES
involves substitution, permutation,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.330
which represent confusion and diffusion,
and also use the encryption key.
