00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.263
Good job. Let's do one more. You have a sample of size 24, and you get a t

00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:12.660
statistic of 2.45. So remember, this is just like the z score. So here's your t

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.510
statistic. The area to the right of the t statistic is between what and what?

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.310
Enter these values exactly as shown in the t table, and as precise as possible.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.230
This one might be kind of tricky but just remember what the t statistic means.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.433
And remember that the values in the column headers are the probabilities.
