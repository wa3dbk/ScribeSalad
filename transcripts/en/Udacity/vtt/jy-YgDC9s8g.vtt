Let's look a little bit more at the general form for a linear equation. I'm

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:08.250
going to do a little thought experiment concerning a, b, and c. Now what would

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.245
you have if both a and b were equal to 0, but c was not equal to 0. Would you

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:16.547
have an equation for a vertical line? An equation for a horizontal line? Would

00:00:16.547 --> 00:00:20.232
you have something that's not an equation at all? Or would you have a

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:21.545
conditional equation?
