00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.953
Note that the slope from our last line was negative. As we look at this graph

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:08.090
from left to right, the line goes down. If someone were walking or hiking along

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.228
this line, they'd be going downhill, which corresponds to negative slope. Our

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:16.361
slopes don't always have to be negative, though. If we turn the line slightly,

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:20.807
we can see that we would have a flat line. We know a flat line has 0 slope,

00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:25.892
because it has lots of run, but no rise. And 0 divided by any non-zero number,

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:31.033
would make 0. We could also turn our line a little bit more. This would produce

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:36.047
a positive slope. So now we would be walking uphill. Positive slopes always

00:00:36.047 --> 00:00:40.922
point up, and to the right. The last type of line is a vertical line and these

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:45.657
slopes are undefined. They have lots of rise but zero run. Remember, we cannot

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:50.208
have zero in the denominator so the slope must be undefined. For our walking

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:54.849
guy, we also remember he can't walk up a vertical wall. That's impossible, so

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:59.251
the slope is undefined. So that might be a way you can remember the slope is

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:00.003
undefined.
