Hello again. Well, that was a bit of guesswork.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But I think you might have guessed the right answer.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We can do so by elimination.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we remove the angled brackets, the all of this HTML tag is going to turn into regular text.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This will create a very different behavior in Mozilla,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and therefore we are probably not going to reach the code

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which originally caused the failure.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The same goes for select.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If we remove the attributes--that is, name equals operating system

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or multiple or size equals 7--then our input will still be a select tag

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
with no attributes at all,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and this will still trigger the original failure.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, you see that in this big HTML input, only eight characters are relevant

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for reproducing the problem.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This will certainly give us nice reward from the Mozilla developers.
