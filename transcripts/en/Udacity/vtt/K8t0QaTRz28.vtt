00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.640
Let's move up a dimension into
a three dimensional space and

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.320
let's start out by
thinking about planes.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.480
We're going to start by studying
planes in three dimensional space

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.520
because they are highly analogous
to lines in two dimensional space.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.951
Just like a single linear
equation Ax + By = k in codes

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:22.974
aligned in two dimensional space
A single linear equation Ax

00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:28.580
+ By + Cz = K encodes a plane
in three-dimensional space.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.540
Another way to view the equation
Ax + By + Cz equals k

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.750
is like before,
a dot product of two vectors, A B C.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.960
x y z = k.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.720
And like before with lines.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.560
If we take A, B, C dot x, y, z = 0.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.210
That means that vectors from
the origin to points x, y,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.860
z in the plane are orthogonal
to the vector A, B, C.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.390
Thus A, B,
C is a normal vector to the plane.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.550
And also like with lines changing
the value of the constant term k

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.590
shifts the plane but it doesn't change
the direction of the plane at all.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.597
So regardless of the constant
term the plane defined

00:01:14.597 --> 00:01:19.440
by Ax + By + Cz = k has
ABC as a normal vector.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.160
Let's call two planes with
parallel normal vectors parallel,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.770
since their faces are in
the same direction.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.342
If we have two parallel planes Ax +
By + Cz = k1 and Ax + By + Cz = k,

00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:35.478
the same coefficients in
front of each variable but

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:40.768
different constant terms And
that means any point XYZ satisfying

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:46.190
the first equation can't satisfy
the second and vice versa.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.560
So two different parallel
planes do not intersect.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.640
This is just like the case
with lines in two dimensions,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.540
two different lines with the same
normal vector don't intersect.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.560
We also have another analogy to our
treatment of lines in two dimensions.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.790
Remember that if we knew two lines were
parallel then we could check to see if

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.199
they were the same line by finding the
vector between a point on one line and

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.440
a point on the other.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.710
If that vector was orthogonal to
each of the lines normal vectors

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.320
then the lines are the same.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.660
Similarly if two planes are parallel
that is they have parallel normal

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.240
vectors then we can pick a point on one
plane and another point on the other.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.930
If the vector connecting them is
orthogonal to the planes normal vectors

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.380
then the two planes must be the same.
