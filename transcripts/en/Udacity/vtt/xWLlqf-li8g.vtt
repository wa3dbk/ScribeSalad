00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.130
We start out by multiplying the top and

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.160
the bottom of our fraction by the conjugate of our initial denominator.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.870
So that means we're multiplying by negative three minus the square root of five,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.020
over negative three minus the square root of five. We can't really simplify

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.420
the numerator. It's just going to stay as negative three times the square root

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.791
of two minus the square root of ten. The denominator does simplify however,

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:28.370
since we know that the square root of five squared is just five.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.220
And nine minus five is just four. So this is our final answer, negative three

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.769
times the square root of two minus the square root of ten all divided by four.
