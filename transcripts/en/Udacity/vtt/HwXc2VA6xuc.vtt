00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.080
Let me show you how I did this. We have the loop for the rows, and the loop for

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.707
the columns. Notice that the rows jump in steps of two. We'll do the same thing

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:13.585
for the columns. Now I need to compute the average of these four pixels. Let me

00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:18.230
draw my little picture again. So here's position I J. And I want to compute the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.182
average of this one. This one. This one, and this one. I already have the one

00:00:23.182 --> 00:00:30.356
in I J. This one here has row I, column J plus 1. The one over here has row I

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:34.707
plus 1 and column J. And finally the one over here has row I plus 1, column J

00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:42.560
plus 1. I add those four, divide by 4, and that's my average. And I need to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.984
stick it back into. Each of those four pixels. I already have the coordinates,

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:52.080
so I can just copy them. I'm almost done, but I still have to put in the bounds

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.967
here. When we talked about the gas prices, we were told, what the general rule

00:00:56.967 --> 00:01:02.487
is, so let's just do that. The length of a two dimensional array, is the number

00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:07.638
of rows, and the length of a row is the number of columns. Let's see what it

00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:12.370
looks like when we run it. Here was the original picture. Here are the process

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.048
gray levels. Now, you won't be able to see this on the video, but if you run

00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:19.324
this at home, if you carefully look at this arc for example, you will see that

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:25.080
it is more pixelated. Now, the point of all this was, to work with neighbors.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.090
To figure out if you have a pixel position, what other neighboring positions.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.930
That many, many image manipulation algorithms where you have to do just that.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.240
For example, to blur a photo, to sharpen it or to process it in other ways. Now

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.190
you will work with Sarah with an entirely different problem. She will show you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.970
how to use two dimensional arrays for a grade book with a kind instructor who

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.750
wants to know which students are doing very well and also which exams are too

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.213
hard.
