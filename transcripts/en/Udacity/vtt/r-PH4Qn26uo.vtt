00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.910
The main point of what I just showed
you is that instead of looking at all

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.190
possible paths, by using recursion,
we can look at n squared t paths.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.340
And remember, the reason we
can do this recursion is that,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.240
that, that recursive form, formula
only looks back at the previous state.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.270
We're taking advantage of
that Markovian property.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.420
And with just the forward algorithm,
we can evaluate the probability

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.240
of seeing that entire observation
sequence, given the machine.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.800
So for example, and I haven't yet

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.820
told you how to do this,
if we had trained up a bunch of HMMs,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.710
and some new observation sequence comes
in, I could have told you which one was

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.590
most likely using just the recursive,
just the forward recursive algorithm.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.150
Right?
It requires the As and the Bs,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.500
but that's what it means
to have trained up the HMM.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.210
So I want to tell you about
the rest of the problems, but

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.680
I'm just going to tell it you in words.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.142
I'm not going to give you the math and
you can go look,

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:57.540
there are A bunch of tutorials on HMMs
out there if you want to do the math.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.200
They're pretty straightforward,
all right?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.270
So, the forward recursive
algorithm that I just showed you,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.080
can compute the likelihood of
being in state i at time t.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.140
And having seen all
the observations up to time t,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.090
given that you have the HMM lambda.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.812
You can similarly define
a backward algorithm.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.315
All right,
just sort of starts from the back,

00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.940
goes backwards instead of the front.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.320
And it's a recursive algorithm
that computes the likelihood

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.680
of being in state time t and seeing
the remainder of the observations.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.210
Again, given the, the HMM.
