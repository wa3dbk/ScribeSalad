00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.107
All right Michael, last example
I want to give you is something

00:00:03.107 --> 00:00:06.100
that comes from the world of
what's called drama management.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.630
And the way I'm going to
introduce this to you

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.360
is I'm going to point out what we've
actually been talking about so far.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.710
So I'm cheating a little bit for

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.480
you in helping you with what have
we learned part of the lesson.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.120
So I'm going to claim
that if you think about

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.880
at least the last few things
about communication and

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.430
coaching particularly on the coaching
thing with human beings we've kind of

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.750
talked about three different ways that
a human can communicate to an agent.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.299
The first is demonstrations.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.900
You show the example of one
particular drawing through

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.110
a grid world to do inverse reinforcement
learning and that was a demonstration.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.290
And I can give you
multiple demonstrations.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.610
And we talked a little bit about rewards
and that what a human can give you is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.160
rewards for various things that you do
and that's a kind of reward shaping way.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.780
And then last thing we talked
about was policy shaping where

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.680
the human is communicating to
you is not demonstrations and

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.250
not reward values, but
actually telling you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.310
what the correct policy thing is in
response to things that you've done.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.780
And the last policies is different from
the first demonstrations in that in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.850
the first case you would actually
demonstrate what the right action is.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.270
But here with the policy shaping
you're just giving critique that

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.560
gives information about whether
a particular policy is correct or not.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.420
Does that make sense?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.312
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's interesting there's
these different kind of mechanisms for

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:20.240
giving feedback.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.230
&gt;&gt; Right, so I want to talk
about another sort of model and

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.510
way of doing coordination.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.310
This time between a human and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.760
an agent who's interacting
with another human, right?

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.360
So in the cases we described
before there were two.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.640
There was the human and
there was an agent, but

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.400
here I'm going to say
there's a third person.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.865
So I'm going to replace the human
with what I'm going to call a Player.

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:45.552
For example,
a player of a game like Pac-Man.

00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:48.770
The Agent,
which in this case would be Pac-Man, and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.750
a third human,
I'm going to call the Author.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.810
So in the world of drama managment
there's this basic idea that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.274
there are these things like Choose
Your Own Adventure stories there's

00:01:58.274 --> 00:02:00.945
ways of seeing tasks in the world
as if they are a games.

00:02:00.945 --> 00:02:05.092
Where there's some Author, someone who
designs the game designs the system

00:02:05.092 --> 00:02:07.449
whether it be Pac-Man or
a story or a movie or

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:11.020
anything if you can imagine any sort
of interaction in the world and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.888
wants to build an Agent,
which is actually a system,

00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:17.650
which interferes with the third agent so
to speak which is the Player,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.540
the person that's controlling
what's going on in this world.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.390
So, in this Pac-Man example the Author

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.910
would be the person
that created Pac-Man.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.670
The Player would be

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.486
the person controlling Pac-Man running
around in this world and eating.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.950
And then the Agent would be
the actual Pac-Man game itself, and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.980
that Agent might have the ability
to change the way the ghost behave.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.290
To set up another level that
has different properties or

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.120
whatever it wants.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.660
And the goal of the Agent is
to create an experience for

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.800
the player that is consistent with
whatever it is the Author wants.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.939
Does that make any sense at all?

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.240
&gt;&gt; At a high level.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.800
I mean, how does the Author
express what he or she wants?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.710
&gt;&gt; That's a good point.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.070
So, he Author wants to
the Agent something,

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.510
the Player is going to be
interacting with the Agent and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.200
the Author never gets to
play with the Player.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.380
How does the Author express
to the Agent what it wants?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.290
Well, that's what I'm
going to talk about but

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.680
let me just kind of give
you a little preview.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.330
Imagine that the Author
says to the Agent.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.090
I want the Player to be able
to win every level, but

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.760
only after they died several
times in that level.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.530
I want the Player to feel like they
have to learn how to play better.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.080
So the game has to be hard,
but it can be so

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.520
hard that the Player can never win.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Now I haven't told you how to

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.820
communicate that with numbers, but

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.640
you can imagine that that's
an objective function.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.955
It's a thing I could write
down that I keep track of

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:53.475
how quickly a Player
can go through a level.

00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:54.735
Whether it gets better over time.

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:58.125
I could come up with a function that
tries to capture elements of that

00:03:58.125 --> 00:03:59.745
either directly through
the experience or

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:04.235
by describing properties of the game,
properties of the Pac-Man level

00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:07.220
that need to be traded off one another
in terms of things like difficulty.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.887
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; So there's lots of ways of

00:04:08.887 --> 00:04:12.766
doing it and people have been solving,
worrying about this problem for many,

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:13.607
many years now.

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:18.081
And I want to describe a particular
mechanism that combines this notion of

00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:21.966
demonstrations and rewards so
that you can come up with a way for

00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:24.973
this Author to convey
information to the Agent so

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:30.200
that the Player has an experience that
is consistent with the Author's intent.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.726
Okay?

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:32.856
&gt;&gt; Neat yeah, that seems to fit with
a couple of things we've been talking

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:33.750
about in this lesson.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.140
&gt;&gt; Excellent, so let's dive in.
