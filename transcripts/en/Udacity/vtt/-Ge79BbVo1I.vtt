00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And now we come to a model that has way more compartments than the one before.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A model for heat conduction in a wire.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's draw imaginary lines after each millimeter of that wire

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and treat each millimeter as one compartment.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Every single compartment is treated in the same way,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so we can just look at one single of them to get an idea of what happening, let's take no. 8.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Compartment no. 8 loses a specific percentage of its energy

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
per time to compartments no. 7 and no. 9.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
To be specific, let's say it's going to lose 1%/ms to the left and 1%/ms to the right,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but there will also an energy flow from compartment no. 7 to no. 8 with the same

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
percentage of the energy of no. 7 and there will be an energy flow

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
from compartment no. 9 to compartment no. 8.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Again, the same percentage but of the energy content of compartment no. 9.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So after a short amount (h) of time, the temperature of the compartment no. 8

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
will be its initial temperature plus that amount of time

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
times 1%/ms to be gaining 1%/ms from compartment no. 7

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and we are gaining 1%/ms from compartment no. 9 but we are losing 1%/ms to the left and to the right

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so we're losing thrice that percentage.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
One final thing to be doing to clean things up a little, let's get rid of this 1%/ms here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If we work with seconds instead, 1 second amounts to 1000 ms, so we need 1000%/s.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
1000% is 10--so now, we have an equation for the temperature

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of the compartment no. 8 after one time step.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Of course, this works similarly for all other compartments.

00:01:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We've just change the numbers. Its about the left neighbor, the right neighbor, and ourselves.
