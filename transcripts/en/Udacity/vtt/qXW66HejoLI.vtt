00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now in economics and in game theory, the value of a state is called its utility.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's just a number.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we're at the end of the game, and if there's 1 state where we win,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we'll give that a utility of 1.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If there's another state where we lose, we'll give that a utility of 0.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now if I have a choice here--it's my turn to move--I have a choice to go either way.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm going to maximize my choice, and I'm going to move there.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That means the utility of this state is going to be 1 because I know I can get 1

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
by taking the optimal strategy.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We keep backing up the tree that way.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's if it was my choice here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If it was my opponent's choice, and they could go in either way,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
then my opponent is going to minimize my score or maximize their score

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and go in this direction, forcing me to lose and allowing them to win.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So we'll say the utility of this state is 0 for me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And I want to also introduce here another idea called the quality,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is the function on a state and an action and gives us a number--a utility number.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So that's saying, what's the quality of this action in this particular state?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So if these were the actions, hold and roll, then we'd say for my opponent

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the quality of rolling from this state would give us this utility,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and the quality of holding would give us this utility.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Finally, if it was the dice's turn--and let's say there are 6 outcomes, but 3 of them

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
lead to this state and 3 of them lead to this state--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
then from the dice we're going to average over all the possibilities,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
so it's half of one and half of 0, so the utility of this state is 1/2.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So now we have a way--if we know the value of the end states,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
which is defined by the game, defined by when we win and lose and how many points

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
each player gets for that--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
now we have a way of essentially searching backwards to say, from the end state,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I can go backwards and say, what's the value of one of my moves?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Oh! I know that. It's the maximum.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
What's the value of my opponents? I know that. It's the minimum.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What's the value of a random dice roll?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I know that. It's the average.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now we could go all the way back, backing up the tree to say,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
what's the value of this start state?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I can collect those values, and I can have a utility for this start state,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and we'll see--in the game of pig--the start state for the first player has a little bit better

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
than 50% chance just because they go first.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
For the game we defined, I think it works out to about 54%--

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
.54 utility for the player who goes first.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We can also work out the quality for each of these moves.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We can work out, what's the quality of rolling from this state,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and what's the quality of holding from this state,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and then the optimal strategy is just the one that says choose the move

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
which has the highest quality.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If roll has the highest quality from this state, then that's the move that we should do.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So just as we did in search, we're finding our way from the start to the goal.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We can do that with a random problems,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
but we have to find a way not to just 1 individual outcome,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but to all the outcomes that were covered by all the possibility of the dice.

00:03:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So the complications going to be more complex, but the idea is the same.
