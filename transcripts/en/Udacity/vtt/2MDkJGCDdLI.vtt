The solution for the drinking birds crossbar and nose are nothing special. You

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:07.228
set the position. You rotate it by 90 degrees and you're pretty much done. The

00:00:07.228 --> 00:00:10.956
eyes are a little bit more interesting. First you have to translate to position,

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:14.542
then rotate. To do this, you have to make an object 3D so that you can do the

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:18.492
rotation after the translation. Our drinking bird is functional but could always

00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:21.639
be improved. He could maybe have a few helices for his tail feathers. His

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:25.164
eyeballs could be flatter and he could have pupils for his eyes. He could have a

00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:28.796
jaunty hat and a corncob pipe in his mouth. The crossbar could surround his tube

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:33.275
instead of poking through it. He could have classier feet. I hope you'll play

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:36.025
around with him and improve his appearance. I'd love to see what you come up

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:36.273
with.
