00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's practice a bit more with regular expressions.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to write out a bunch of strings, and I want you to check all of them--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
there may be multiple--that exactly match 0 through 9, the regular expression.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Down here I've written seven strings.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.950
Check each one that matches the regular expression 0 through 9.
