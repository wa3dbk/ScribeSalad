00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.562
We already said that the value of X that makes the denominator equal to 0, which

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:08.832
is the first way that we can find a critical number was 4, so that will be one

00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:13.299
of them. The other way we can look for critical numbers is to set the numerator

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.531
equal to 0 and solve for X. So if we set 2 X minus 18 equal to 0 we end up with

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.903
X equals 9. So that must be our other one.
