00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.687
In the previous exercise, we had to
sent the username and password with

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:07.627
every request that was protected by
the off.loginrequired_decorator.

00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:09.051
This is inconvenient and

00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:13.640
can be seen as a security risk even
if the transport is secure HTTP.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.890
Since the client application must
have those credentials stored without

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.280
encryption to be able to send
them with these requests.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.560
When rendering HTML pages with Flask, we
had the ability to use the login session

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.310
object to store information about the
state of the client between requests.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.770
Flask did this by creating
an encrypted cookie for

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.120
us that the browser could
append to each HTTP request.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.580
But since our RESTful API may not
always work with the browser or

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.860
a client that can securely store and
transmit cookies,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.820
we need another method for storing and
communicating credentials.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.220
A popular solution to this
problem is to create tokens.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.380
A token is a string that
the server generates for

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.700
the client that can be passed
along inside an HTTP request.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.560
The idea is that the client application
exchanges authentication credentials for

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.450
an authentication token and

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.430
in subsequent requests,
just sends the token.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.970
When the server receives the token,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.940
it can then look up the credentials
of the user and determine whether or

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.520
not it is authorized to
the information it is requesting.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.650
Tokens are usually given out with an
expiration time after which they become

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.113
invalid and
a new token needs to be obtained.

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:23.153
The potential damage that can be caused
if a token is leaked is much smaller due

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:24.534
to their short life span.

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:28.476
A server can easily determine if a token
is to old and decide to reject it,

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:30.235
if it doesn't view it as valid.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.650
So how would we go
about creating tokens?

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.883
A straight forward implementation
is to generate a random sequence of

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:38.677
characters of certain length
that is stored with the user and

00:01:38.677 --> 00:01:41.080
the password in the database.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.120
Possibly with an expiration date,
as well.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.240
The token then becomes sort of a plain
text password in that it can easily

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.650
be verified with the string comparison
plus a check of its expiration date.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.565
A more elaborate implementation that
requires no server side storage

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:59.460
is to use a cryptographically
signed message as a token.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.976
This has the advantage that
the information related to the token

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:07.274
namely the user for which the token was
generated is encoded in the token itself

00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:11.398
and protected against tampering with
a strong cryptographic signature.

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:14.753
Flask uses a similar approach
to write secure cookies.

00:02:14.753 --> 00:02:18.210
This implementation is based on
a package called itsdangerous.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.120
In the next video,
we will use the itsdangerous library

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.220
as we take on adding token generation
and verification to our user model.
