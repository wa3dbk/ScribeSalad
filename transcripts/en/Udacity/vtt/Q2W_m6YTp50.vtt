00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.927
So after the initial warm-up period, we have seen,

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:08.362
that the 2-bit history predictor will start predicting this,

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:13.750
with 100% accuracy. We also see, that this predictor is really wasting

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.540
one of its four 2-bit counters because, it's only using three of the four,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.110
to predict this pattern. And the fourth one simply never gets used. So

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.930
we have it in the entry, but we really didn't need it.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.940
Now let's see what happens if this same 2-bit history predictor is trying to

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.300
predict, the alternating pattern, the not taken taken, not taken taken, and so

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.080
on. For that pattern, when we are trying to predict this non-taken here,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.890
we're seeing a history of 01. That means the counter 1, will be counting down.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.030
When we are trying to predict this, we have a history of 10, and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.180
when we have 10, that means counter 2. Is counting up. For this,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.670
we again have a history of 01. So, counter 1 counts down. And

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.423
when we try to predict this, we have 10, in history. So counter 2,

00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:12.213
is counting up. As you can see, for this pattern, counter 1 and

00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:16.150
counter 2 will very soon start predicting correctly. And there are really,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.430
only two of these counters used. One because the history can be 01, and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.540
one because the history can be 10. We never can see the history of 00,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.690
or 11, which means, after the initial warm-up period, this predictor will also

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.240
predict this with 100% accuracy. We have already seen that the 1-bit

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.040
history predictor can predict this with a 100% accuracy, which is good.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.590
But, this predictor is not using half of its 2-bit predictor entries. So

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.668
basically, in the entry that corresponds to this branch, we are really

00:01:47.668 --> 00:01:52.800
using only two of the four 2-bit counters, so the waste is larger. In general,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.930
an N-bit history predictor, will correctly predict all patterns of length.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.220
Less than, or equal to, N plus 1. We have seen that a single bit predictor,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.030
can predict correctly the pattern that is of line two. A 2-bit predictor

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.700
can predict correctly a pattern of length three and also of length two.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
Both of them, of course, can predict a pattern of length one, which amounts to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.310
always taken, or always not taken. In general, an N-bit history predictor,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.580
will predict all patterns of length, its history size, plus one, or

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.023
less than that. However, the N-bit history predictor, will cost us,

00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:37.850
the N-bit of history plus, 2 to the Nth, 2-bit counters. Per entry.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.580
Each branch will have an entry that we index into that will be of this size.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.900
So the entries become very large. For example,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.240
if it's a 10-bit history we're talking about several kilobits worth of stuff,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.250
for a single branch to be predicted. If we have, for example,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.210
a loop that has something like a. Loop out branch and a loop back branch.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.330
That will spend two of these entries. And, how about the waste? Most of

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.160
the 2-bit counters that we have in our entry will be wasted. Why? Well because,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.950
if we have for example,. A 10-bit history, there are 1,024 entries.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.710
We can only predict patterns that are up to 11th in length, and

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.140
a pattern of length 11, will have 11 possible histories at most. So

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.963
of the more than a thousand histories, we will really be using. Only up to 11 of

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:38.740
them, for accurate prediction. The rest of the histories are mainly, waste. So

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.090
as as we can see, by increasing the N here which is the length of the history,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.990
we're improving, our ability to predict longer and

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.410
longer patterns. But, our predictor becomes very expensive,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.490
very quickly and much of the cost that we are adding is waste. So

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.330
the question is, why would we want to have N large? Why not just settle for

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.050
something like, patterns of length three? Well it turns out,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.420
that a very common type of a pattern, is a loop, where we have something like,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.620
this would be. Don't exit the loop, don't exit the loop, exit the loop.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.019
So it's a tri-iteration loop, and then we repeat that loop many times. So for

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.150
example, in order to do something like a eight iteration loop,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.550
we have to have a pattern, of eight or nine length. Which means we need,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.260
an 7 or 8-bit history in order to predict that successfully. So

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.550
we do want to have a long history, but we'd rather have it,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.760
without this huge cost and without the huge waste that the cost comes with.
