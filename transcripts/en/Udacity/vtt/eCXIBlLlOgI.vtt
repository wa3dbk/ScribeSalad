00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.399
This is an algorithm, although this is maybe up for debate. And when it works,

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:09.270
it makes a doorway. You might have felt like my instructions were ambiguous.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.380
I'm going to pretend they were perfect, though. If you can write clearer

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.085
instructions, post them on the forum. I'd like to read them. And now, I'm going

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:19.533
to do my best impersonation of a robot and follow this algorithm. So, first I'm

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:23.678
going to place an 8 by 2 block horizontally. I'll do it this way, so you can

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:26.983
see what I'm doing. And I'm going to stick a 2 by 2 block on the top of the

00:00:26.983 --> 00:00:31.600
left end of the 8 by 2 block, so right here. Now, 3 times, I'm going to stick a

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.510
2 by 2 block on top of the previous block. So, this was the previous block,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.700
one, two three. And now, I'm going to stick a two by two block on top of the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.586
right end of the 8 by 2 block. And I'll repeat three times, putting a 2 by 2

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:49.642
block on top of the previous block. And now, I put an 8 by 2 block on the

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:52.030
highest two. And we have a doorway.
