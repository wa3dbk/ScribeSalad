00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.980
So here's the reducer code. Let's step through it. We'll

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.689
start by setting up a couple of variables. Sales total,

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.420
which we'll keep the running total, is initialized to 0.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.700
Because we haven't read any keys yet, old key starts at

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.790
none. Then we start reading from standard input. As with

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.890
the mappers we receive a line at a time that's tabbed

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.290
eliminated. In this case we expect a store name, a

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.350
tab, and one of the sales. So we'll strip out the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.670
new line, separate the value and the key by

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.395
tab. That should give us two items which we'll store

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.370
in an array called data. If we don't have two

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.870
items, something strange has happened so we'll skip that line,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.830
but that should never be the case. Because we know

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.390
that mappers send us the data in this format. For

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.130
the sake of clarity, we'll store the two items in

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.130
the array into variables. ThisKey will get the store name,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.340
thisSale, the value. So here is the tricky part. We want to

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.860
know if the key has changed since the last row we

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.560
read. So we'll check if oldKey is even set, because if

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.140
it's not, then this is the first line we're reading. And if

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.230
it is, we'll see if it's different to the key we

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.020
just read in. If that's true, then the key has just

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.940
changed. In our example data, we had just switched from the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.190
Miami row to the New York City row. So now we need

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.290
to write out the result. Which'll be key, which

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.690
is the store name, a tab and the sales total

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.890
for that store. Then we reset sales total back

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.570
to 0. Now for every row that we process, we'll

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.250
set oldKey to the key we are working on,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.210
then add the current sale to the running total. And

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.450
then we'll loop back to the next row. Eventually, we'll

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.190
run out of data, which will take us out of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.790
the loop. Do you think we're done?
