00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.790
So the answer's 20. And here's why. So

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.890
initially, we've created the name hours, and assigned it

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.340
the value 9. So, I was, will refer to the number, 9. That's what we have after

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.020
the first assignment statement. For the second assignment

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.170
statement, first we evaluate the right side. And that

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.390
says hours plus 1. That will produce, 10, heading 1 to 9. And now we assign that

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.360
new value to hours. So that'll change what

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.090
the name hours refers to. Now ours will ref,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.430
refer to the, number 10. Then we do

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.170
a multiplication. The third assignment statement, has hours on

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.350
the right-side, hours times 2. So that will

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.770
evaluate to, the value hours refers to which is

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.060
10, times 2, so we get 20. And then

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.410
we get assignment, that will change the value of

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.530
hours to now refer to 20. So, at the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.071
end of these statements, the value of hours is 20.
