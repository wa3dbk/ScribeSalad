00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.318
Here's a thought experiment. Imagine you're a firefly. Now, imagine you're

00:00:04.318 --> 00:00:08.790
flying around in a closet with the door closed. You're the only light source.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.665
Finally, imagine your light is quite bright and that you have human eyes. Horrified yet?

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:17.628
An easier way to say it is this. Imagine there's a single light source in

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:20.991
the scene and you're viewing everything from its location. Which of the

00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:25.603
following are true, if any? Objects are visible, but get dimmer the farther you

00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:29.850
are from them. Objects are visible, but only in shades of gray. Objects are

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.388
visible, but are only solid colors without shading. Objects are visible, but not

00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:36.903
shadows can be seen.
