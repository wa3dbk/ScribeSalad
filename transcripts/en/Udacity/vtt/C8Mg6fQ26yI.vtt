00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And here is my answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To get the likelihood of a set of numbers, we just need to multiply in

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the probability of seeing every single data point.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we start at 1 since that's the identity.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For every data element we go through and multiply by the probability for element i

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and then we return it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you're interested in a real challenge, note this function can actually be written on just 1 line.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So for anyone watching who is a real Python enthusiast,

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
feel free to post your 1-liners to the forums. Have fun.
