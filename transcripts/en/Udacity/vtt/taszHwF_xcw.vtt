00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.108
As it is, this equation could be useful
for Grant, but I think that it could be

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.368
more helpful if it looked a little bit
cleaner. So, let's simplify. But wait, how

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.224
do we deal with this minus sign and these
parentheses around this part of the

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:16.627
expression? We see like terms here so we
know that we will be able to simplify this

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:20.803
somewhat, and even though, we haven't
talked about exactly how to do this, just

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:25.033
give it a try. If it doesn't work out, no
problem. We'll talk about it in a second.

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:29.227
So type your answer for the simplified
version of this expression into this box

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:32.484
and please remember to simplify as much as
you can. Good luck.
