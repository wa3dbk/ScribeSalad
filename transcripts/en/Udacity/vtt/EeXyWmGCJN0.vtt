00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Yes the answer is $120.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
By our logic, 1500 lies between 1400 and 1800.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In fact, it's a quarter away from 1400.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We'd say it's $112,000 plus 1/4 of the way from 1400 to 1800.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's a difference of the price of an 1800 square foot home and a 1400 square foot home,

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
adding a quarter of this gets us from $112,000 to just $120,000.
