00:00:00.171 --> 00:00:03.140
Now that we have some background on why GPUs look the way they do,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.810
we'll now discuss what a GPU looks like from the point of view of a software developer.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.317
One of the themes of this class is the importance of programming in parallel.

00:00:10.317 --> 00:00:14.719
This is a crucial skill, not just for GPUs, but also for CPUs even.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.290
If you buy an 8 core Intel Ivy Bridge processor, we see that it has 8 cores.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.195
Each core has 8-wide AVX vector operations.

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:26.234
Each core supports two simultaneously running threads.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.700
Multiply those together and you get 128-way parallelism.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.945
On this processor, if you run a completely serial, C program with no parallelism at all,

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:37.475
you're going to use less than 1% of the capabilities of this machine.

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:41.946
There's no doubt that parallel programming is harder than serial programming, no matter what your target.

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:44.149
But I hope by the end of the class, we'll convince you

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.887
that this additional complexity is worthwhile for the potential performance gains.

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:49.321
And throughout the course of the class,

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:52.790
we'll try to lay out the benefits and the limitations of this programming model.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.395
One of the really exciting things about GPU computing is that it moves quickly,

00:00:56.395 --> 00:01:00.433
and some of today's limitations may disappear in the next generation of GPUs.
