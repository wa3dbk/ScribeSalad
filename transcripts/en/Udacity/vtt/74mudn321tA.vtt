00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.115
This one is true, the mode can be used to describe any type of data, numerical

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:10.524
or categorical. You saw in the last quiz that male versus female is categorical

00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:15.465
and the mode was male, however, all scores in the data set don't affect the

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:20.942
mode, necessarily. Take this data set. The mode is 22 because it occurs 3 times

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:26.401
and the rest of them occur once. However, if we take away the value 14, the mode

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:31.647
will still be 22. Now, let's say we add an extreme value like 1 million, the

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:36.705
mode will still be 22. So, we cannot say that all scores in the data set will

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:41.484
impact the mode, this one is also false, if we take a bunch of samples from a

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:46.830
population the mode is likely to change from sample to sample, let's illustrate

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.630
this idea with this applet, its really cool. Tthis is a histogram distribution,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.210
this is called the bell shape curve and let's pick a random 5 sample that this

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.497
software will generate for us So just look at these top two. You see that the

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:12.996
mode is here, which is kind of at the left of this distribution. Let's do it

00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:21.840
again. Now the mode's here at the right of the distribution. If we do it again,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.472
the modes again, at the kind of far left of the distribution. Now here, there's

00:01:30.472 --> 00:01:35.814
not even a mode. So you can see that if we take samples, the mode is somewhat

00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:40.754
arbitrary and it won't necessarily be similar to other modes and it also won't

00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:45.897
necessarily represent the population. Another thing about the mode is that it

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:51.666
changes as you change the bin size. So, if we make the bin size smaller, looks

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:58.708
like the mode is going to the left. Here it's at about 470. Here it looks like

00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:06.049
it starts at about 450. And the mode changes as we change the bin size. If we

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.969
make the bin size really big, then the mode occurs in this interval, between 346

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.961
and 514 point 74. So the mode really depends on how you present the data.

00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:23.319
Because this third point is false, we can't really use the mode to learn about

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.076
our population. And this is our goal in this course, inferential statistics. But

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:32.509
still, the mode is important to take into account when describing a data set.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:37.442
And finally, this last one is false. While there's a procedure to find the mode,

00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:42.242
where you look at all the data values, you see which one occurs the most, or you

00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:47.117
look at the histogram and you see which bin has the highest frequency, we can't

00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:51.767
describe the mode with an equation, and this is why we often use the mean, or

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:52.777
the average.
