So of course yes, we could reload the page 10,000 times. That

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.660
might take a while and that would make this a very boring

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.470
quiz. Send the link to 10,000 friends. Well that's not going to really

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.130
work, right? Because if we send the link to 10,000 friends they're

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.460
going to be in 10,000 different browsers. And they're all going to have their

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.120
own Now, their own cookie with their own counts. So, that's no

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.490
good. Or we can just edit the cookie in our browser. Which

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.210
is the answer that I'd like to talk about. So, let's go

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.580
ahead and see if we can do that.
