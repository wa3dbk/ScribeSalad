00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.160
One way of setting up live
editing is within your browser.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.690
Some editors, like Brackets,
come with live editing built in.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.802
In Brackets, you press a button
that will launch a new instance of

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:14.940
your browser with your
updates already live.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.860
Sublime Text doesn't have it built in,
but the Takana plugin gets pretty close.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.710
However, it supports CSS and
SCSS live editing, but not HTML.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.950
Chrome DevTools has a relatively
little known feature called Workspaces

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.150
that allows you to ditch
the editor altogether and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.270
work directly in the browser.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.570
You can make changes to your CSS
right in the Styles panel, and

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.200
have them persist.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.620
The same goes for JavaScript.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.510
There's a link in the instructor's notes
listing all the steps you need to take

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.160
to set up Workspaces on your computer.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.420
The fundamental flaw with
live editing in your editor

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.400
is that it isn't aware
of your build process.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.390
So be mindful of that.

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:03.840
Browsersync allows us to have live
editing that is assisted by our build

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490
tool, improving upon the two
methods we showed you before.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.880
For this to work, we can reuse something
we've already learned about, and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.170
that's the watch task that currently
watches our Sass for changes and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.415
compiles them into CSS.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:21.570
Browsersync works by creating or

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.290
proxying a local web server which serves
and tracks your files for changes.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.650
Best of all, it's free, open source, and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.440
is compatible with most Node.JS-based
build tools including Gulp.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.750
So let's go ahead and set it up.
