00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.480
Determining the top line, top visible line and

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.810
the number of lines together tells us which lines will be displayed.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.490
This determination is based on the attributes of the viewport, its size,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.230
the file manager, its document size, and the scrollbar, the handle positions.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.020
Hence there is an association, a three way association, amongst all three

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.800
components. You can also call that a ternary, as opposed to binary, association.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.860
Let's call this association displays, as in the view port displays the contents

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.660
provided by the file manager and determined by the scroll bar
