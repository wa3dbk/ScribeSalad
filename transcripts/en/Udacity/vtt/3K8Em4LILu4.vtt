00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now for the answer--if I undo the failure-inducing change as returned by delta debugging,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
can I actually build the program.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yes, I can because this actually tested by delta debugging that the alternative

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
makes the program passed, so the program should build normally

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and also the failure should no longer occur.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Whether the problem is properly fixed though is another thing.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I may have fixed the failure in question, but by undoing these changes,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I may have introduced new bugs.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In particular, these changes appear they're probably made with some specific feature in mind

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the very least that will happen is that I'll lose the new feature that would be introduced

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
by these changes, so I can't really say that the problem is properly fixed.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I need to come up with a change that includes the new features or at least the effect

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
or at least the intended effect of these original changes,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but avoids the bad effect mainly the failure--so this is the final answer..
