00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.670
Now that you have a cluster
running it's time to test it out.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.340
You need to make sure everything
is running as it should.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.540
To test the cluster's processing
capability you can run terasort.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.710
Typically you test your cluster
on a terabyte or more data but

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.010
since you didn't provision that
much storage you'll do less.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.600
You'll have to type in
some long commands here.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.340
So like before I'll give you
the command so you can copy and paste.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.300
First create a home folder for any data.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.500
Next you'll need to create some
random data for the terasort example.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.290
Teragen writes rows of
random data to a file.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.220
Here are our random data.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.681
Each row is 100 bytes long and
we have 500,000 rows.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.780
So 50 megabytes in total.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.180
Remember this is replicated
across the cluster so

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.140
it takes up 150 megabytes
across the three data nodes.

00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:51.270
Now run terasort on the data you
generated which will sort the data and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.680
write it to a file sorted data
If the cluster was configured

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.790
properly everything should
have run without feeling.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.370
Next, we can measure the input and
output IO speeds with test DFSIO.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.410
This will write in removable
files to and from H.T.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.460
F.S and record the average IO speeds for
these tasks.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.890
Then to read files from disc.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.670
The results are written to
test DFSIO results dot log.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.890
If you want to view them later.
