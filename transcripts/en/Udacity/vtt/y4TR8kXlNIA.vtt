00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.796
The object starts in model coordinates, choice F and is transformed to world

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:08.227
coordinates, choice I. The object then gets transformed to view space a, so

00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:12.590
that the world is oriented with respect to the camera's frame of reference. In

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.470
practice we often go directly from object space to camera space with a single

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.604
transform, the model view matrix. The projection matrix is applied to get the

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:23.438
clip coordinates, choice h. And the coordinates are divided by w to get the

00:00:23.438 --> 00:00:27.352
model into normalized device coordinates, choice e. Finally the data is

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:30.172
converted into Window Coordinates to get it into an image to put it on the

00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:31.929
screen, choice C.
