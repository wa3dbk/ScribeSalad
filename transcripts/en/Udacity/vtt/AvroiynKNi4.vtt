00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.030
In this lesson, you'll become more familiar with ANOVA by going through a full

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.109
length example that not only includes calculating the F statistic, but learning

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.890
about and calculating a measure of effect size for the differences between

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:19.430
three or more groups. This is similar to Cohen's d for the t tests. To improve

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.980
the lives of dairy cows, a researcher examined 3 types of foods, they wanted to

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.530
assess cows prefernece for one food over the other all were equally nutritous

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.436
and afforadable. Together the farmer and the researcher gave the cows each type

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:39.576
of food there were nine cows bessie frank and slim got food a Bob, Red, and

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:46.485
Pippin got food B. Sam, Merry, and Chip got food C. They were randomly assigned

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:51.341
to each type of food. Over eight hours this is the amount that these cows

00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:57.336
consumed in pounds. The data can be visualized with bar graphs. Before we get

00:00:57.336 --> 00:01:01.824
started with our analysis, match the independent variable dependent variable,

00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:07.656
null an alternative hypothesis, with the column on the right. Not all of these

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:11.680
will be used. Put the appropriate letter next to each.
