00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.150
All right, let's use these games and

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.808
screens to create a game with multiple
different screens it can display.

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:09.294
Instead of a ApplicationAdapter here,
we're using a Game.

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:14.168
If we right click on Game,
and say Go To &gt; Declaration,

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:19.792
we can jump into the source code
of the Game class inside LibGDX.

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:22.968
As we see,
Game implements ApplicationListener.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:27.251
It seems that the Game class has
a screen member variable, and then for

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:30.302
each one of
the ApplicationListener callbacks,

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:35.060
if it has a screen it then delegates
that callback to the screen.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.019
Here we've declared two screens,

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.617
one of which displays the number
of frames displayed per second.

00:00:40.617 --> 00:00:43.559
And the other display is the number of
seconds between the current frame and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.127
the last one.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:48.010
To set the active screen, we just
need to call set screen on our game.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.060
Let's check out delta screen.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.236
&gt;&gt; Screens are very similar to
application listeners with a couple

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:54.009
differences.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.837
Instead of create,
screens get a show call.

00:00:56.837 --> 00:01:00.967
Screens can receive a hide call when
another screen becomes active and

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:06.120
the render call received by a screen
includes this argument called delta.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.485
The argument delta is the number
of seconds after the previous

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.342
frame that this frame is
expected to hit the screen.

00:01:12.342 --> 00:01:15.685
In a normal game running
at 60 frames per second,

00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:20.834
this will be approximately 0.0167
seconds or 16.7 milliseconds.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:24.662
However if your game is running on
old hardware or is just trying to

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:28.506
draw way too much stuff you may
end up with a delta that's larger.

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:32.020
In this screen we've created a bitmap
font and a sprite batch, and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.428
we're just displaying the delta that's
been passed into the rendered callback.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.613
Also we've included logging on
all of the life cycle methods so

00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:42.750
that we can investigate what
happens when we switch screens.
