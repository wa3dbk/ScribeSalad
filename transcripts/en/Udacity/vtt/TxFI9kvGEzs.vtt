00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.486
1 divided by 9axy is correct. You're becoming a pro at these complex fractions

00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:09.053
if you got this one correct. The lowest common denominator might have been

00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:14.090
tricky, so let's find that first. We look at the denominators of 3 a squared b,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.418
and ab. We know these two denominators share a common factor of a times b. The

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:22.797
other factor for this denominator is 3a. And the other factor for this

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:27.980
denominator is 1. We multiply them together to get 3 times a squared times b.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.798
And remember we want the highest power of any variable or factor that appears in

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:37.324
our denominators, 3 is the highest number factor, a squared is the highest

00:00:37.324 --> 00:00:42.210
variable factor for a And 1b or just b is the highest for, well b. Next we

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.446
multiply by the LCD divided by LCD a form of one. These two factors would cancel

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:56.384
out, leaving us with 2xy in the numerator. Here we can cancel out 1a and 1b.

00:00:56.384 --> 00:01:01.140
This means we have to drop this power down by one. Leaving us with 3a times this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.920
expression. 3 times 6 is 18 and then we just list the product of the variables.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.020
Now you might be wondering why I listed this a first instead of on the end.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.304
Usually we list the product of the variables in alphabetical order but it's

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:19.700
certainly okay to leave this a on the end. And finally we want to simplify our

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.718
rational expression. These are the factors of the numerator. And these are the

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:28.526
factors of the denominator. We can cancel the factors that equal 1, which leaves

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:33.680
us with a 1 in the numerator and 9 times a times x times y, in our denominator.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.527
This is why it's important to remember that 2 divided by 2 equals 1. There's

00:01:38.527 --> 00:01:42.740
still a 1 in our numerator. We want to make sure that appears in our answer. We

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.390
can't simplify this anymore, since 1 is the only factor in our numerator so

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.943
we're completely done.
