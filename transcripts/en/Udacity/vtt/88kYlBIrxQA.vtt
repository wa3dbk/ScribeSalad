00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.640
In addition to design methods, representations and

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.860
validations, there are some other issues that arise with software design.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.510
We already talked about the difference between architectural and

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.840
detail design and exactly where that boundary is. Of key importance is

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.760
the respective energies we put into designing the functional part of the system

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.190
versus dealing with those non-functional constraints. At a more abstract level,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.700
there's the difference between what and how. The specification process deals

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.210
with what the system will do. The design process begins to say how we're

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.380
going to do it. Finding the right boundary between those two is a key issue. And

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.120
finally, what is there about your particular application that is going to affect

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.620
the design process? For example, you have some existing resources that you want

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.220
to reuse and build in your solution. They can affect the design that you do.
