00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.400
For this one, we'll have one square root of 5 plus one square root of 5. We

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.615
simply add the coefficients in front of the radicals together, to get 2 square

00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:12.248
roots of 5 or 2 times the square root of 5. We do the second one in a similar

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:16.230
way, to add 3 and 1 to get 4 times the square root of 2. Here, we're

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.300
subtracting the same quantity from the original amount. So that would make 0.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.586
If you need a little bit more convincing on this one, keep in mind there's a 1

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:27.607
in front of each of the radicals, so we can rewrite this expression by

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:33.845
factoring out a fourth root of x. We'll have 1 minus 1, which we know equals 0

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:39.131
and 0 times anything is 0. For the fourth one we subtract 1 from 3 to get 2

00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:44.820
times the cube root of a times b. Here, are the indexes of 3 match and the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.750
radicands are same ab, this means we can actually subtract the two radicals.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.821
And finally for our last one, we have 1 root of 3 plus 1 root of 3 plus 1 root

00:00:53.821 --> 00:01:00.720
of 3. This gives us 3 roots of 3, or 3 times our square root of 3. I know these

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.733
are pretty tricky, so great work if you got at east three of them correct.
