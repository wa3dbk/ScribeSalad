00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.032
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite in sine. And they're

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:09.738
reciporical of one another. This is negative 3 halves. So I know my slope must

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:14.392
be positive. And it must be the reciprocal of 3 halves. So it must be 2 3rds. If

00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:16.545
you put positive 2 3rds, nice work.
