00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:03.030
Okay, so I can see how
the Firebase database is a better

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.230
choice than other data
options out there.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.939
But are there other features that
are part of the platform that

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.020
are a good fit for
shopping list plus plus?

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.100
&gt;&gt; Well, knowing what you want
to do with your application.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.550
Here are the top reasons why I
think you should use Firebase.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.200
Data that is available in real time, so

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.360
users all get updated
shopping lists on demand.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.680
So if Walter adds some
items on a shopping list,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.230
you'll see these immediately.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.370
Synchronization handled by the client.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.050
Regardless if the client is online or
offline.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.180
This ensures that clients that were
turned off or maybe in airplane mode

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.210
get the freshest copy of the data
possible when they come back online.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.680
This is also helpful because you can
still add items to your shopping list

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.100
when you're offline and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.440
have those changes available to
Walter when you're back online.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.730
Easy to implement
authentication methods,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.140
all without writing a lot of clients.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.980
With this, Walter can use e-mail and
password or

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.070
his Google Plus account to log on.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.540
Well in addition to what
we've talked about,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.550
another benefit is Firebase's
two tier approach.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.020
Many applications use
a three tier approach

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.110
where the middle tier contains business
logic or some application server.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.340
But this introduces complexity and
system management issues.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.880
For shopping list plus plus,
it's not necessary.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.730
Instead, with Firebase you
use a two tier approach.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.770
Basically, this is a client server model
where you communicate directly with

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.980
the database.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.060
It's cheaper, easier to maintain,
quicker set up and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.130
in the case of Firebase,
highly performant.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.740
&gt;&gt; All right,
that sounds pretty good to me.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.900
Although I do have one more request.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.070
Do you happen to know any developers
that are actually using Firebase?

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.910
&gt;&gt; Sure I've actually got
a Firebase developer advocate

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.650
here with me right now.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.910
&gt;&gt; Well, shoot.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.380
I'm a bit busy getting our first
user set up with the app but

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.990
the developer has some free time.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.860
Maybe they could join you.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.010
&gt;&gt; Sure.
That'd be great.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.590
&gt;&gt; Hey, if you want,
you can take the company skateboard.
