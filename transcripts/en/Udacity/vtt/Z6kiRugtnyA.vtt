00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.904
Even though the spotlight has disappeared, the way that three

00:00:02.904 --> 00:00:03.391
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.446
shadow system works in this case is that it dims down all kinds of contribution

00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:11.274
including ambient. The reason the spotlight itself disappears is that the

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:15.876
Lambert material is normally evaluated per vertex for illumination. The ground

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:18.648
plane has just four corners all of which are outside the spotlight's area of

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:23.782
influence. So, just the ambient light is applied. The shadow in the scene isn't

00:00:23.782 --> 00:00:27.824
baked on. It's in fact evaluated per pixel. But that's a separate part of the

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:31.498
illumination process in this case. A spotlight is not a specular highlight, it

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:35.992
effects diffuse and shiny objects, alike. Finally, you can think of the area

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:39.284
outside of a spotlight as being in shadow. But that doesn't explain why the

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:43.605
Lambert material effects it. If you use the Lambert material and were to test

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:46.440
like the ground plane into a grid of squares, you'd start to see the effect of

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.194
the spotlight as you can see in these images. Going from left to right, the

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:51.741
ground plane is

00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:52.178
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:52.178 --> 00:00:55.673
more and more, catching the spotlights effect better and better. However,

00:00:55.673 --> 00:00:59.313
evaluating the spotlights effect per pixel instead of per vertex, means many

00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:03.050
fewer triangles needed to be generated and processed.
