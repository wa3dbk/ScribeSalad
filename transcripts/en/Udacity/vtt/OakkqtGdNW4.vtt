00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.421
Sometimes you don't have to implement an algorithm at all to reuse code. The

00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:08.605
Comparable Interface is a very common interface. And implementing comparable

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:12.520
allows you to use handy pre-implemented algorithms for tasks like sorting.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.393
Here's the documentation for Comparable. It's an interface that has exactly one

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:21.760
method, the compareTo method. Classes that implement the comparable interface

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.065
promise that they will implement the compareTo method. When you call

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:32.280
a.compareTo(b), it returns a negative number if a comes before b. It returns a

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.497
positive number if a comes after b. And it returns zero is a and b are exactly

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:41.335
equal. Once you implement the compareTo method, anyone coding can use it to

00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:46.563
figure out what the natural order of objects in your class is.
