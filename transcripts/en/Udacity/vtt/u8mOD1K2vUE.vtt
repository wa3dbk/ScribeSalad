00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.490
Once you've learned how to parse JSON
data, it's pretty straightforward to

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.370
be able to parse the rest
of the fields that we need.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.109
Since this isn't a course on Java or

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.470
JSON, we're going to provide you with
the parsing code in the gist below.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.280
And this is what the gist looks like.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.070
There are three helper methods.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.430
The first is for formatting dates.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.640
The second is for rounding temperatures.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.450
The third is returning a forecast JSON
string into an array of forecasts.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.960
This method also handles associating
a date with each forecast entry.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.930
We start with a current date, and we
increment one for each successive day.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.750
Notice that we also use Julian dates,
which is the number of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.570
days that have passed since
the beginning of the Julian period.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.813
More information is in
the instructor notes below, but

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:44.400
it's how we'll consistently
deal with dates in our app.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.550
That way, when comparing dates,
we don't have to worry about taking into

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.760
account time zones or
daylight savings time.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.040
Update the fetch weather tasks to
use these helper functions and

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.890
the doInBackground method should
return a string array of forecasts.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.750
You can log the output to check
that the array is correct.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.150
The format of one day's
forecast should look like this.
