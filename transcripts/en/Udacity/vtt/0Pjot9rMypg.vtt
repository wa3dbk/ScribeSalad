00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.740
Let's look at the solution for our 1-Bit History Quiz. We have a 1-Bit history

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.650
that starts at zero. And two bit counter for each possible history,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.810
all counters start at strong not taken. And the pattern we are trying to predict

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.670
is the not taken, not taken, taken, etc. After 100 repetitions of this pattern,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.930
what is the total number of mispredictions that we will have seen?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.000
One way to approach this problem is simply to work through the table like we

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.740
have seen before. So we will have our state, the prediction, the outcome, and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.140
whether we are correct. And now we will just work through the outcomes.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.351
The outcomes will be N, N, T, N, N,

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:48.690
T, etc. And of course we will not go through a 100 repetitions of this. Pretty

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.430
soon the predictor will start to be very consistent about what it's predicting

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.141
in each round of the pattern. The state initially is zero, strong not taken,

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:03.980
strong not taken. The prediction as a result of that will be use 0th counter,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.630
which is saying strong not taken. So the prediction will be not taken.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.819
This agrees with the outcome, so we are correct. Update the predictor. So

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:20.018
the state will be zero because the outcome was not taken. Strong not taken will

00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:23.737
be updated with a not taken outcome, so it stays strong not taken, and

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:28.870
the other counter just stays the same. Now the predictor again, will predict not

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.870
taken, using zero and strong not taken. And it will again be correct.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.810
So, the history stays at zero, the strong not taken stays at strong not taken,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.220
and the other counter just stays the same. And at this point,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.000
we will again, with the history of zero use this, predict not taken strongly and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.230
be wrong this time. So after one round, we have a single misprediction.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.634
The history will be one now. And the predictor here

00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:04.940
will be updated to weak, not taken, because there has been a taken outcome.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.449
And the other predictor just stays the same. Now we will use a history of one,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.420
to index say strong not taken. So the outcome will be not taken and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.040
be correct. Next, we will keep the strong not taken here.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.420
The other counter stays the same. The history becomes zero because of this, and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.800
we will use a history of zero to index into the weak not taken state, and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.230
thus predict not taken again. Again we are correct in our decision.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.820
Next, the history stays zero, because the decision was not taken.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.240
The update of the weak not taken goes back to the strong not taken,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.000
because the decision was not taken, the other counter stays the same.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.720
And using the history of zero, we will index and use this counter.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.160
This counter says strong not taken, so we will predict not taken.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.520
This will disagree with the taken prediction, so we will have a misprediction.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.311
This concludes round two. As you can see, at the end of round two,

00:03:08.311 --> 00:03:11.495
we have the same state that we had at the end of round one.

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:16.316
So now, pretty much what happened in round two will repeat more times.

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:21.228
Overall, in the 100 repetitions of this, in each repetition we have a single

00:03:21.228 --> 00:03:26.455
misprediction. So, the correct answer is that we have 100 mispredictions, or

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:32.190
one-third of our decisions are wrong. As you can see,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.640
the 1-bit history predictor is not a great predictor for this type of a pattern.
