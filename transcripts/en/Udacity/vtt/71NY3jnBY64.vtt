00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.752
To find all these potential zeroes, we know that, for each one, we're going to

00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:08.444
take a factor of negative 13, and divide it by a factor of 2. Then we need to

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:12.568
the positive and negative versions of each of these ratios. So we could have 1

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:17.401
over 1, which is 1. Or the negative version of that, negative 1. 13 over 1,

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.822
which is just 13. And negative 13, as well. In the end, we come up with eight

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:25.849
roots, so the rational of zero theorem tells us this function might have.
