00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.430
The very last diagram that I want to discuss is

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.900
the state transition diagram. The state transition diagram is defined for

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.270
each relevant class in the system and basically shows the

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.880
possible live history of a given class or object. So what

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.090
does it mean to describe the life history? It means

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.630
that it describes the possible states of the class as defined

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.910
by the values of the class attributes. And it also describes

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.710
the events that cause a transition from one state to another.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.800
Finally, it describes the actions that result from a state

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.050
change. So if you put all of this together you

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.760
can see how this can represent the whole history of

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.860
the class, from its creation to its destruction. So let me

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.610
discuss the transition diagram in more detail, and also provide

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.550
information about the notation used to represent them. We have

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.770
states, that are represented by ovals with a name. And

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.820
we have transitions marked by the event that triggers the transition.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.500
What transitions indicate is the passage from one state to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.430
another state as the consequence of some external stimuli. Notice

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.930
that not all events will cause a state transition. So

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
for example, some events might be consumed within a single state.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.500
And we'll get to that in a second. But in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.200
most cases, an event will trigger some state transition. Events

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.480
may also produce actions and they may also have attributes

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.100
which are analogous to parameters in a method call. And Boolean

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.830
conditions that guard the state transition that is prevented

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.860
from happening in the case the conditions are not

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.630
satisfied. States may also be associated with activities and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.450
actions. Specifically, activities are operations performed by an object

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.410
when it is in a given state and that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.690
takes time to complete. Actions, conversely, just like the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.270
actions corresponding to an event are instantaneous operations that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.420
are performed by an object. And can be triggered

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.050
on entry. So, when the object reaches a given state,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.970
when the object exits that state, and also when a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.240
specific event occurs. And in this case, this notation is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.930
basically a shortcut for any event that will cause a

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.840
state transition that will bring the object back into the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.696
same state. Since we have several actions and activities, it

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:04.480
is probably worthwhile clarifyinig the ordering of such actions and

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.559
activities. So the way in which these actions and activities

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:10.079
occur is, first of all, we have the actions on the

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.737
incoming transition, so this is performed first. Then if there is an

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:17.321
entry action that is the next action that would be performed, then

00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:22.370
we have activity and event actions as appropriate. And finally exit actions.
