There are two parts to the answer. We first need to write some piece of code

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.748
like this to set up the slider itself. This code has run at initialization. In

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:11.564
the render method we use the effect controllers field of view variable to set

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:15.295
the camera's field of view, which is also in degrees. Once the camera

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:18.925
parameters are set we call update projection matrix to make the camera changes

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:22.412
take effect. We'll talk much more about field of view and exactly what it

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:25.810
means, though I think you have a pretty good idea after doing this exercise.
