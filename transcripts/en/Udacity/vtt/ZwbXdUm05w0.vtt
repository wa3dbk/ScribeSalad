00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.450
As we said, the key idea is we're
going to use this model of motion to

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.140
make these predictions.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.990
And there are two goals, right?

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.800
Goal number one is that we can
do less work because of this.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.015
Because we have some idea of where the
object is going to be we can restrict

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.025
our search.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:21.895
Goal number two is we should be able to
actually improve our estimates because

00:00:21.895 --> 00:00:25.685
we're using both predictions based
upon dynamics and our measurements.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.960
Now, to do this,
we're going to make certain assumptions.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.750
Okay?
And the assumptions basically come down

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.980
to the notion that this is some
form of continuous motion.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.590
We're going to assume that
objects don't disappear and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.990
reappear instantly somewhere else.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.520
For those of you child psychology,
that's a whole Piaget thing.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.010
Kids don't come to that belief until I
don't know, it's like year and a half or

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.170
something like that.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.380
So like kids who are, are really little,
if you take a toy truck and you've got

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.290
a screen here, and you put the toy
truck behind the screen, and then you

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.450
lift up the screen and the truck's not
there anymore, they're not surprised.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.630
Things disappear in their universe all
the time, or it becomes a, a carrot.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.340
They're not surprised either.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.070
Then all of the sudden they get to
a certain age where the truck comes,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940
if you pick it up and
it's a carrot, they're like whoa.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.480
All right?
And

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.550
that requires a certain
change in the mental model.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.970
Okay I don't know why I mentioned that.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.820
It's just really cool.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.060
It's true by the way, not that Piaget is
all true but that's true about children.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.650
Anyway so we're going to make our
assumption in our tracking that,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.970
that things don't just appear and
disappear.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.200
We're also making an assumption that
the camera doesn't move instantaneously.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.620
You know,
because that would be the same thing.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.330
All right, if I instantly went from
here to here, right, big change,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.240
things will have violated my
apparent continuous motion.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920
So that's basically that there's
this gradual change imposed between

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.680
the camera and the scene and the object.
