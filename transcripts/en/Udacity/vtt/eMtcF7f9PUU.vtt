00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.650
CSS also supports background images and

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.570
this feature can be used to achieve
a number of responsive effects.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.880
You can use CSS to add a background
pattern to an element or

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.900
the page itself.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.870
And you can combine that with
gradients and other CSS effects.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.280
It's possible to get some
incredible effects with pure CSS.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.330
Check out the examples on the website
linked to below the video.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.560
With the background size cover property,
CSS can also be

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.610
used to add a background image that
resizes without squashing or stretching.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240
And again, this can be really handy for

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.000
using images when you don't
know the size of the viewport.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.010
The details in a photo can
get lost when it's shrunk, so

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.340
this example displays the whole
image if the viewport is

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.490
more than 500 pixels wide,
or a smaller crop otherwise.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.320
I've added a CSS transition, so

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.934
there's not too much of a jolt
if you resize the window.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:01:01.020
You'll see that in the DefTools,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.340
the smaller koala crop is displayed,
downloaded when the window is small.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.200
And then,
if you resize the window larger,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.410
the larger crop is downloaded and
displayed.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.890
CSS background images can be used for
conditional display of images

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.970
depending on the viewport size,
using CSS like this.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.700
As you can see from the dev tools, the
background image file is not downloaded

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.660
if the viewpoint width
is less than 500 pixels.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.720
Now, you'll find out more
about media queries later.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.287
And a much less hacky and, and

00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:39.840
a much more efficient way to
accomplish alternative image loading

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.830
when we look at the source set attribute
and the picture element in lesson three.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.360
With background images, you can
also use the CSS Image Set function

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.800
to choose a background image
depending on screen resolution.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.450
This example displays a 2x color
image on a high resolution display,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.240
like my phone, and
a 1x monochrome image, otherwise.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.150
For the devices that
don't support Image Set,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.330
the CSS falls back to the 1x version.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.650
If you check the dev tools,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.140
you'll see that only the appropriate
image is downloaded.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.030
You'll learn a lot more about responding
to screen resolution in lesson three.
