00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.210
So, the question is,
how powerful is morphology?

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.610
And like most questions in life,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.770
the answer is what I have to always
tell my kids, kids, it depends.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.360
If you have nice, clean binary images,
or even, I shouldn't say that.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.630
If your binary images behave exactly the
way the three or four binary images you

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.440
looked at when you designed the system
were behaving, then things will be fine.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.110
So clean might be the wrong word.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.610
If it's well, here it says almost clean.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.030
Let, let's just say that your binary
images are, sort of, well-behaved.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.345
So here's an example and, again, this
comes from Linda Shapiro, all right?

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:37.930
Here is an original binary image, and,
if I ask you to look at that quickly and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.680
ask you where are the faults in those
gears, you would have to look for

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.560
it at a long,
look at it for a long time.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.980
But if I show you this picture, and I
say, where are the faults in the gears?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.460
You would say, oh, I guess there's
one here, and there's one there, and

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.740
now when you look at it you see,
yeah, there really is,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.580
there's a tooth missing from the gear.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.390
So the question is,
how did they do that?

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.660
So again, I'm not going to
into too much of the detail,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.720
I'm just going to show
you this set of images.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.800
It's all on one page,
that's the sequence of operations, and

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.980
i'll just describe them briefly, okay?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.670
So, here was their original
picture that i showed you.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.800
Basically over here,
they were looking for places that had

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.970
a ring that would be essentially
black like this, white out here.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.150
And remember I was telling you
about don't care pixels, you know,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.620
don't care in there and, and, and of
a particular shape, particular size, and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.620
the only pixels that
lit up were these guys.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.520
Okay?
All right?

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.520
Well that's fine, and then you say okay,
I'm going to take those and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.550
I'm just going to dilate them
by something called a hole mask,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.890
which is just this basic shape.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.470
All right?

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.810
So you realize what you end up
with is just the holes filled up.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.764
Well, if I, or
this plus this, I get that.

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:55.190
So voila,
I have filled the holes of my gear.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.850
Okay, great.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.368
Then what I can do is I can essentially
do the same trick again of removing

00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:07.560
pixels that basically have with
a structuring element like that.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.907
So I find every place where a
structuring element like that fits, and

00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:15.140
that will rem, that will be able to
pull out these, these middle parts.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.690
And then I can dilate the edge, and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.580
I end up with this thing
that looks like that.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.400
Great.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.040
That's sort of a bound around the edge
that's thicker than the edge.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.211
If I and these two things, so
it's an and, I get just the teeth, okay?

00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:34.730
That's what's shown there.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.030
And, and also, you'll all notice we're
starting to see there's that gap

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.690
right there, because that's where
the teeth are missing, all right?

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.550
Well, what I can do is I can
dilate that by something that

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.550
has the size of the tip.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.290
And if I run that around here,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.570
I end up filling everything except
where that gap is, both here and there.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.050
And then given those, I can do,
in fact the result is just a,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.540
it's got this thing called defect queue.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.372
That's just this little round ball,

00:03:00.372 --> 00:03:02.842
basically the operation's
exactly as it is here.

00:03:02.842 --> 00:03:06.963
It's b 7 right, minus b 9 here,

00:03:06.963 --> 00:03:11.368
dilated by the defect queue, or

00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:15.642
back with b 9 and I get this, okay?

00:03:15.642 --> 00:03:19.040
So, would I expect you to
implement something like that?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.340
I, I don't know.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.580
The point is that with
these relatively simple,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.120
low level mathematical operations, you
can do a relatively sophisticated shape

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.020
analysis if you have
the particular shape that you,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.710
if you know the particular shape
that you want to deal with, and

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.830
the particular types of defect sizes,
for example, you wanted to find.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.790
So, there are other
operations that you can do.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.190
Here's a, just a list of things
that you might computer.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.640
These are shape descriptors
of binary blobs.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.510
And, like I said, this used to be a very
important part of computer vision,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.100
especially in assembly or
machine vision of inspecting 2D parts.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.680
And for those particular applications,
it still is.
