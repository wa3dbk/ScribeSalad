00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.180
The code to do this is almost identical to the code we've used in

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.350
our scatter plot.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.270
First, we create an extent, but in this case we're using our nested object.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.030
And in our accessor function, we have to first reach into the values attribute

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.310
of our object and then grab the attendance, which we then use in our D3 scale.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.730
In this case, we're setting it up to be a square root scale with input domain

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.050
equal to the extent we just created, and range on the order of 0 to 12.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, both for the type of scale we use.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.030
Whether it's the square root, logarithmic, linear, and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.240
what output range we choose.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.360
It often takes some experimentation and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.710
playing around with values to find out what visually looks the best.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.030
And now we can properly scale our attendance values,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.150
returning them in our accessor function for

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.870
the radius, and reload our page to see what affect this has had.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.300
Well, as you can see here,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.280
the circles have shrunken back down to a manageable size.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.780
And we can see that there's some variation in how big they are,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.400
which corresponds to the attendance for each
