00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.840
This multiplication, simplifies to this expression. Now this might look really

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.225
complicated, but it's not too tough to get there. First, we distribute the cube

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:14.730
root of 4xy to each of the terms in our second parentheses. When we multiply

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.976
these two cube roots together, we'll get 64, x cubed, y cubed. So we know this

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:26.140
distribution gives us this first term. Now we want to distribute this to the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.322
second term. For the second term, we'll have the cube root of 12, and then xy,

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:35.946
from these variables here. Next we distribute the cube root of 2 to this term.

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:42.166
So we'll have the cube root of 32x squared y squared. And finally for our last

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:47.302
term we'll have the cubed root of 2 times the cubed root of 3. Which equals the

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:51.271
cube root of 6. Next we try to simplify any of the radicals that we can. The

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:57.890
cubed root of 64 equals 4. And the cubed root of x cubed y cubed is xy. This

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.355
radical is already simplified since there's no factor that repeats 3 times

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:06.261
underneath the radical, so we leave it as is. We can't simplify the x squared y

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:12.230
squared since we don't have a group of 3. But we can simplify 32 here, since 32

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.709
is the same thing as 8 times 4. The cubed root of 8 equals 2, and this leads us

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:22.160
to our answer. On the end here, the cubed root of 6 can't be simplified, so we

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.324
have to tack it onto the end. There's no like terms here since none of the

00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:31.502
radicands are equal. So we're done. This is our final answer.
