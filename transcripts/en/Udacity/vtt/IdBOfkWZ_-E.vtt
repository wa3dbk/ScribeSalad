00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.010
Building Java projects are relatively
simple when compared to

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.810
Android projects.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.140
It is still a multi step process
that we prefer to automate.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.620
Gradle provides full support for
Java projects.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.980
To include compiling our sources,
creating a jar file,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.258
generating documentation,
running test, and creating reports.

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:19.490
Gradle models the java build
process by creating tasks for

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.090
each of these steps and wiring up
the necessary dependencies for us.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.790
A typical Java build will usually
involve compiling our source code and

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.270
processing resources.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.040
And packaging those resources and
Java class files into a jar.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.200
It can also include test code,
which will need to be compiled, and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.150
then the tests run themselves.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.210
Optionally a Java project may also
include generating Java docs or

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.870
packaging source jars.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.080
Gradle also creates lifecycle tasks for
us.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.750
Describe common build outputs
like assembling our artifacts.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.270
Running project checks or
doing a complete build.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.450
All this functionality is
provided by free Gradle,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.430
in the form of a plug-in,
which can be applied to to your project.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.940
Now let's take a look at how to
add a Java plug-in to our build.
