00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you're doing more than just watching these lectures, one of the things

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you're going to be staring at a lot is the Business Model Canvas.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you're watching this video, the first thing I suggest is stop, go to businessmodelgeneration.com,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and download the canvas and print out bunch of copies.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then go get a bunch of yellow stickies and a red pen because that's what

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you're going to be using for the next couple of weeks.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, what we actually do with the Business Model Canvas is in week 1.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You use those yellow stickies to put up all your hypotheses

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and you probably don't have many facts yet but you can make some pretty good guesses about

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
what's a value prop, where the customers are, what your channel is and what your pricing is,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but what more can they do is really interesting.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's as you come back in with facts, we're going to be marking up the canvas

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and crossing out the things that actually weren't true and replacing them with the things we've learned,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and we're going to do that week after week until what we end up with

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is a step of Business Model Canvases, and what you'll find out is at the end of the class,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you can actually play back these canvases almost like a filmstrip

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and see what you've learned overtime.
