00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.310
So today we discussed a learning method called learning by recording

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.400
cases. In learning by recording cases, we file away individual cases we

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.740
have encountered in the past in order to use them for future problem solving.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.080
We talked about the nearest neighbor method as a way of finding the most similar

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.700
case to the current problem that we faced in the past. But in the real world,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.680
this can often be very difficult. So we talked about using nearest neighbor to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.360
find very complex similar cases to our current problem, such as our navigation

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.300
example. However, there are still a lot of limitations to this method.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.420
Oftentimes, just executing a solution we've used in the past doesn't work.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.860
And oftentimes, we have to store cases based on qualitative labels instead of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.520
numeric labels. These weaknesses will be addressed

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.800
in our next lesson when we talk about case-based reasoning.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.040
There we'll add adaptation and evaluation into our process, and

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.189
start to be able to use cases in a much more thorough and robust way.
