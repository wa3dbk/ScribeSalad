00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.640
What we will be talking about is just
different techniques and ways to

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.880
optimize the 60 frames per second
section of the web optimization project.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.760
So what is this 60 frames per second?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.900
Just want to remind everyone
who are on project four, or

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.243
who will be on going on project four,

00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:27.110
is that you need to achieve 65 per
second when you are scrolling.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.270
So basically when you're browsing, when
you're scrolling through the website

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.280
on the pizzas page, all those little
pizzas that are animating and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.550
the background should be
rendered at 60 frames per second.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.085
So let's first look at
the Google Dev tools and

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:46.960
see what does that really mean.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.460
This is Google Dev Tools here.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.023
This is what recording
the timeline look like.

00:00:52.023 --> 00:00:56.459
And if you can see here,
what I basically did I launched

00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:00.520
the Dev Tools and
I picked on the Timeline option.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.740
I then look in and record my timeline
I press this black button here and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.690
then I scroll up and down here.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.930
And Google Dev Tools will give
me a nice timeline of that.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.540
It will tell, okay,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.660
how much time it takes to calculate
my events using my scripting.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.320
How much time it takes to
lay out my elements, or

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.700
how much time does it take
to paint my elements.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.270
As you can see here,
these individual bars,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.340
they all should be lower than
the story parts per second line.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.700
We do not even see the 60
frames per second.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.630
Because the calculations were so high
that it's beyond 60 frames per second.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.770
It's actually lower than
30 frames per second.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.150
So basically what we want to do is be,
we want to squish and

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.530
lower the height of these bars.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.650
So low that the 60 frames per
second line will show up and

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.892
we could then be able to see okay, what
are we achieve 60 frames per second.

00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:06.849
So we're going to walk through
different stages of an optimization,

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.619
and we're going to show
you how it will look like

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.419
once you optimize certain
things of your code.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:19.610
So the first thing that I want to
show you realize here is the code.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.865
Whenever we scroll, we're going to
launch this function here at line 577.

00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:27.885
So window.addEventListener scroll.

00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:32.505
So it's going to listen to
the event whenever a user scrolls,

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.755
it's going to launch this function here,
optimization.

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:38.165
And this is the actual function
that we need to optimize.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:40.545
There we go.
And then, we're going to scroll up and

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:43.695
try to look at
the definition of positions.

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:45.425
So it's right here.

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:51.890
So basically we know that we need
to somehow optimize this function.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.030
Because guess what, from our timeline as
you can see, if I were to click on one

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.650
bar or one frame, it takes a lot of
time to actually calculate all of

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.880
our calculations to be able to calculate
all the pizzas that's scrolling.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.800
So basically this is how you
should read this scroll event,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.340
is that you had this event scroll.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.390
This takes up a lot of time.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.295
And then the next event will be,

00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:21.980
recalculate style, it goes into layout,
it goes into paint.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.780
It's painting the actual
pixels on screen.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.225
And then it does some other previous
calculations that are not so

00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:30.955
trivial but basically,

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:36.162
the main bottleneck looks like this
yellow thing which is onEventScroll.

00:03:36.162 --> 00:03:39.365
If you click and expand this,
you see this function call here.

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:42.565
And this function call
is update positions.

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:43.635
So that's optimization.

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:45.980
So I already know that
I have a bottleneck.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.976
We go in, step through this function, I
commented this function fairly well and

00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:54.610
I just comment it with my questions and
my observations.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.920
So basically your first step
is to look at each line and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.420
really understand what
each line is trying to do.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.875
In this case,
I am getting all the pizzas from here

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:09.290
because all the pizzas that
are animating has a class name mover.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.350
I'm going through a for loop and
then I'm changing some,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.495
I'm doing a lot of
calculations here on line 31.

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:22.810
And then,
I then do this calculation here on

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.250
line 541 to actually change
the left position on each pizza.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.145
Now the first thing
that I want to ask is,

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:34.790
is okay, focusing on really,
on this part right here.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.718
Is that okay, in order for
me to understand whether this loop is

00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:41.960
efficient or not,
let's log out all these numbers and see.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.550
Let's log out.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.770
Basically what I would do,
I would like basically do a console log.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.324
I'll log off the base number and it will
log out the document.body.scroll and and

00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:53.342
basically, any other type of variable
that is the being calculated.

00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:58.985
And I want to see which
variables are really crucial for

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:05.130
me to be inside my for
loop which can be outside the for loop.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.830
Because basically I'm thinking
inside a for loop and

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.820
this is the majority
of instructions here.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.190
I'm doing a lot of calculations
per loop, and I'm trying to think.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.930
Is there any way for

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.530
me to reduce the amount of time to
calculate these complex calculation?

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.466
And notice that another optimization
that I'm looking at is,

00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:29.330
when the DOM has been loaded.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.137
This basically says if
the page has been loaded,

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:36.450
I'm going to create 200 pizzas
that will be animating.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.380
And assigned them the class mover,
right.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.410
So, because basically all the animated
pizzas are assigned the class mover.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:50.050
That's when we know those
are the pizzas that should be animated.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.207
And I want to ask myself, here's 200
pizzas that should be animated but

00:05:57.207 --> 00:06:02.997
then if I go back to my pizzas page,
I'm only seeing a handful

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:08.124
of the pizzas that are animating
at any point in time.

00:06:08.124 --> 00:06:12.956
So my second question, do I
necessary need to animate 200 pizzas

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:17.260
if only a handful of them
are showing up on my screen?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.330
So food for thought for everyone.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.970
I'm giving everyone hints, I'm actually
not going to give anyone the answers but

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.220
hopefully this will give you guys and
gals good enough hints for

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.460
you to start thinking about
certain aspects to your

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.740
function and to try to basically
pick apart every line of the code.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.010
And try to ask yourself,
can I make each line efficient

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.280
as much as possible.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.960
Basically if I were to make those
optimizations that I talked about,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.820
I'm going to get a timeline like this.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.820
As you can see,
this timeline is drastically different.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.140
So now we can see the 60 FPS timeline,
and this is the goal.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.900
Our goal is to be able to
basically get all the color bars

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.550
underneath this 60
frames per second line.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.180
And if I were to actually go and

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.760
click on a bar here,
select a bar, basically.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.280
Reduce my timeline.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.420
I can see on my bed scroll,
my yellow here.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.930
Which used to take up the whole time.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.760
The whole 16.667 milliseconds.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.260
It has been drastically
reduced to around

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.960
point 6.2 milliseconds for scripting.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.960
If you look at the numbers to
my lower right hand corner.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.995
It went from 25 milliseconds
to 0.642 milliseconds, so

00:07:48.995 --> 00:07:51.711
that's pretty good optimization.

00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:56.327
And actually for,
just to meet the minimal qualifications,

00:07:56.327 --> 00:07:57.934
this is good enough.

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:03.936
We still have a couple of other things
that we could increase optimizations on,

00:08:03.936 --> 00:08:06.860
especially the paint here,
because the green bar's here.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.309
And a little bit of the purple bar here
because this is actually the layout.

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:17.797
Remember our stages in rendering
from the web optimization file.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:22.448
We have the HTML, the DOM,
we then download the seesaw we look at

00:08:22.448 --> 00:08:26.000
the JavaScript and
we go into the render tree.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.770
Then after that we'd go into layout.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.760
That should lay out the elements,
and then we actually paint.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.880
So this actually shows you
the relationship of okay,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.440
I have event JavaScript.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.490
I'm going to do layout.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.270
Since I've rendered my
rendered shit already.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:49.800
I go and paint and
then I basically rinse and repeat.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.181
If you think about it,

00:08:51.181 --> 00:08:55.100
this yellow line could actually
be reduced a little bit more.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.634
We can actually have a little bit
more opposition from our JavaScript.

00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:01.152
And we can actually get rid
of one of these stages called

00:09:01.152 --> 00:09:02.470
mainly the layout stage.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:08.830
So let's go back into the code and
figure out what else can we do.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.450
So the first thing that we see that any
other things that we can squeeze out,

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.090
any other performances
using query selector, all.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:22.480
Because basically there's a more
efficient way to access your DOM,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.445
and that's using
document.getElementsByClass.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.810
This is actually a more efficient way to
get all the piece of elements and mover.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.970
So this is actually good way
to make things more efficient.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.610
Another one is this line here.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.150
This modular operator here.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.370
If you notice.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.940
Let's let's go back to understand
what the modular operator is.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.780
The modular operator,
I'm looking at my notes,

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.890
gives us the remainder
when we divide 1 by 5.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.110
So it's a remainder.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.686
It's not a division it's a remainder.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:10.480
So basically if i is 1,
1 remainder of 5 is one.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.820
2 remainder of 5 is 2.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.240
3 remainder of 5 is 3, and so forth.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.500
And these numbers repeat itself, so

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.830
basically we will have in
a nutshell if you do all the math.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.820
This will be just five numbers.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.066
No matter how many pizzas you have,
whether it be 200 pizzas or

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:33.469
a thousand pizzas.

00:10:33.469 --> 00:10:36.907
Every time you iterate you will only
have five unique numbers because

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:39.940
the module operator basically
gives us just the remainder.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.650
And we fix the base number of five.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:50.250
So If you think about it,
why can't we just store five numbers and

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.550
then use those numbers to change
the position of our element?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:01.326
One last thing here is
a lot of people have wrote

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:09.230
on the forum is to use some sort of
CSS3 hardware acceleration here.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:17.220
Because basically CSS3 has
hardware acceleration and

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.660
certain transformations that reduce

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.936
the need to retrigger a read layout.

00:11:27.936 --> 00:11:31.160
Basically what I'm talking about is
a lot of people used to translateX.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:38.254
And if you look it up, there's some
articles that talk about this,

00:11:38.254 --> 00:11:41.510
here's the hack to increase your speed.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:46.041
So again, you could do this
instead of using style.left,

00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:51.850
you use transfprm translateX to
actually position your element.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:56.200
Now, what this does is this gets rid
of the need to trigger a read layout.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.110
And if you think about it,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.510
it just basically gets rid of
one event in the purple bar.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.760
And a lot of people says you need
to do this, you must do that.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.490
If you think about, let's go back and
look at the numbers.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.740
Once we do that, this doesn't really
make that much of a difference.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.320
It does but in this case,

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.620
you can get away with perfectly
using this level of code.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.150
For every scroll I'm
repainting the whole screen.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.520
Now the question is, is there a way for
me to only paint the moving pizzas and

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.560
not the rest of the screen.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.390
Because everything else doesn't need
to get repainted because the pixels

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.010
are still good.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.875
So is there a way for
me to reduce this green bar too.

00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:42.720
So I can reduce these total
bars to basically near zero.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.890
How we're going to do that,
this is a hacky way, so

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.960
I want to preface that, that there
are tradeoffs to doing the tech way.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.590
So just be aware as
a developer of the tradeoffs.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.010
So there's a hacky way
to reduce the paint now.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.576
because basically what we do,
is that we tell the browser to

00:13:03.576 --> 00:13:08.145
actually render our pizzas,
our individual pizzas,

00:13:08.145 --> 00:13:12.400
and put them into individual
composite layers.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.400
because basically, even if there
is one pixel that's changed,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.960
the whole layer gets repainted.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.120
So what we do is,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.960
we put all of our individual pizzas
into their individual layers.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.910
Now how can we do that?

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.040
We actually do some CSS hacks.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.060
The hack that I'm going to use is
called backface-visibility: hidden.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.620
I'm actually going to use
this hack to actually force

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.870
the browser to render each
pizza element in its own layer.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.736
So basically,
if I were to animate it now, and

00:13:43.736 --> 00:13:48.340
these pizzas are in their own layer,
it means that I only need to paint

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.090
a small section of the screen,
and not the whole screen.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.900
So how you would do that is,
you basically

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.330
put this backface-visibility: hidden
in the [INAUDIBLE] class in your CSS.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.760
So let's go back to the timeline.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.773
So basically this is what
our current performance is.

00:14:04.773 --> 00:14:10.370
If I choose backface-visibility: hidden,
this is the timeline.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:16.870
And we can see here all of the green
basically no painting involved at all.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.320
So I have a lot of extra bandwidth and

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.230
memory now be able to
do additional things.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.950
I would say this is a very smooth frame
rate because you're barely hitting

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.580
no more than a half of
your available bandwidth

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.780
to be able to render each frame.

00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:33.605
There's one caveat.

00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:35.865
So here's the caveat,
here's the tradeoff.

00:14:35.865 --> 00:14:39.782
So painting here, if you look at this,
painting here is reduced from two

00:14:39.782 --> 00:14:42.455
milliseconds to about
a half a millisecond.

00:14:42.455 --> 00:14:48.288
But the time to fix the script and
to render it should increase but

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:54.136
just from 0.5 scripting here
to 2 milliseconds scripting.

00:14:54.136 --> 00:14:56.381
And then we went basically four or

00:14:56.381 --> 00:15:01.280
five milliseconds rendering to
almost three milliseconds rendering.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.774
And that's the trail that you have to
take because this is my hypothesis,

00:15:05.774 --> 00:15:09.180
I haven't confirmed this,
the more layers you put on,

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:14.400
that there's probably more overhead that
you need to do, and you need to track.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.910
But if you look at the overall
net performance that's

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.450
probably a good tradeoff.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.315
For mobile devices here,

00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:25.499
this hack can really do a number on
mobile devices with low video memory.

00:15:25.499 --> 00:15:29.359
Because basically,
this hack is forcing the GPU or

00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:34.854
the video card to actually render those
pizzas for us instead of the CPU.

00:15:34.854 --> 00:15:37.905
If a mobile device has
low video memory or

00:15:37.905 --> 00:15:43.220
it's not a very fast device,
performance may actually be poorer.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.810
The best way to really find out
what trials to use is to use these

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.970
development tools that were given us.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.310
And also to test the performance
on other devices.
