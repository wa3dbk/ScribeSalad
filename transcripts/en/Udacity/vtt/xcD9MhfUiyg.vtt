00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.090
As we have discussed,
iOS requires military code signing.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.170
This means that, apps that come
with the device, such as MAL or

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.380
Safari, are signed by Apple.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.240
And the third party apps
must be verified and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.010
signed, using
an Apple-issued certificate.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.030
Now let's take a look at the process
by which a third party app developer

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.520
can obtain the Apple issued certificate.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.640
In order to develop apps on iOS devices,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.650
developers must register with Apple and
join the iOS Developer Program.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.170
The real world identity of each
developer, whether an individual or

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.950
a business, is verified by Apple
before their certificate is issued.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.380
This certificate enables
developers to sign apps and

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.670
submit them to the app store for
distribution.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.830
As a result,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.570
all apps in the app store have been
submitted by an identifiable person or

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.310
organization, serving as a deterrent
to the creation of malicious apps.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.160
Furthermore, all apps in the app
store have been reviewed by Apple,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.350
to ensure that they
operate as described, and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.670
don't obtain obvious bugs or
other programs.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.010
IOS devices are only allowed to download
apps from the official Apple app store.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.490
And because of this restricted app
distribution model, plus co-signing,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.950
it is very difficult to upload
malware to the app store and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.410
have devices download such malware.
