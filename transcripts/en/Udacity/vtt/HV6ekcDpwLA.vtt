00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.513
Now we've got everything we need to play basic sound effects with no unfly

00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:08.314
audio processing.

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:08.755
[SOUND].

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:12.103
The only thing we have left to do, is to adjust the volume of various effects

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:17.923
based on where they happen in the game world. For example, when my character

00:00:17.923 --> 00:00:23.700
picks up quad damage, I hear it at full volume. [SOUND]. An explosion that

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.670
happens in the distance may only be heard at half volume. [SOUND]. And it won't

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.550
even hear an enemy who picks up an energy canister on the far edges of the map.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.144
Now, Grits uses a pretty simple distance calculation based on the ViewRect

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:46.414
side. We want to be able to hear the sound, within the screen radius at full

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:52.823
volume. Then, we'll want to scale down the volume to zero, as we reach two

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:59.466
times the radius. Finally, you won't hear any sound at all outside of that

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.701
radius.
