00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.043
We can see that there's a common factor of x minus 5 in the numerator and in the

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:09.079
denominator. So we know those simplify to 1. This would leave us with x minus 6

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.482
in the numerator and x minus 4 in the denominator. Great job on that

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:14.762
simplification.
