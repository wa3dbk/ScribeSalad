00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.060
So your suggestion was to take a modeler and use it to take turn transitions

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.070
into a model, but once we have a model, you already told us last time

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.870
how we can use a planner to spit out a policy. You didn't talk about

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.010
those planners. What are, what's the name

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.420
of the algorithms that you described last time?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; Value iteration and policy iteration.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.017
&gt;&gt; Yes, right. So, so what you can do is, is run either

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:25.350
of those algorithms in here. They both have the same API right, they both

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.650
take models and spit out policies.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.400
&gt;&gt; True.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.300
&gt;&gt; Alright, so, so let's do this as a quiz. We'll say, let's use your idea of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.270
mapping transitions to model to policy. And what

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.700
would you call this whole box? Right? And so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.730
as a whole box, it takes transitions in

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.620
and, and produces policy out. So it is solving

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.030
the reinforcement learning problem. But it's taking a

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.384
very particular approach to it. But let's contrast it

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.150
with the, with kind of the opposite idea. Which is,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.790
we can also map a model through a simulator into

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.250
transitions. And then if we have the ability to do

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.860
reinforcement learning. We can use, turn those transitions into a policy.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.070
So again, as a, as a, composed system. This is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.240
turning a model into a policy, so it is a kind

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.490
of planner, but it's a planner that uses a learner

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.660
inside and this is a learner that uses a planner inside.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.090
So just, as, just out of curiosity I would like to,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.071
just ask people what they'd want to call these. I'm not going to grade

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:24.680
these, but I just I'm just interested. Like, what would you call

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.960
this approach? Does that make sense? Just type it in the box.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.660
&gt;&gt; Let's pretend it makes sense.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.870
&gt;&gt; Alright. Go.
