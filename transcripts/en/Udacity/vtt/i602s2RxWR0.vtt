00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.420
Before you start building
your own readme file,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.140
let's first take a closer look at the
very sections that make a readme useful.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.280
For this example, we're going to
be taking a look at Ledbetter,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.820
a project that's maintained
by GitHub itself.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.830
Now, I don't really know
what Ledbetter does, but

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.780
that's not what we're looking at here.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.890
We're looking at the language that's
being used in this readme and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.752
the parts that make it up.

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:27.500
A readme should provide just enough
context to get a user up and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.870
running with your code.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.040
Keep in mind, we are writing this for
other humans.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.418
We'll start with a title and
a description.

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:38.425
A sentence or two will work just fine,

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:42.720
but be sure to capture the spirit of
your project clearly and concisely.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.420
This will help frame the reader's
experience when going through your

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.650
documentation.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.300
If you're feeling extra fancy,
you can include your project's logo,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.880
if it has one.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.000
Next, include any information
that is absolutely necessary for

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.640
understanding your code.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.650
This may be dependencies
on other software or

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.120
libraries, installation instructions,
common usage, or known bugs.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.160
It's worth mentioning, once again,
that there's no formal standard for

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.830
what a readme should look like.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.870
Don't feel pressured to make your
readme any particular length.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.680
Some can be extremely short, while
others will need to be much longer.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.190
It just depends on your project.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.170
The important part is that
you communicate clearly and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.180
concisely any information that
is essential for the user.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.890
And that you don't make any assumptions
about what the end user already knows.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.840
It's up to you to decide what is and
isn't essential information.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.940
A few good questions to ask yourself
include, what are the exact steps that

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.590
need to be taken to get this
code base up and running?

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.910
What should they already have
installed or configured?

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.600
What might they have a hard
time understanding right away?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.240
Often, developers will include a,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.370
getting started, or
installation section,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.180
to help with any initial setup that may
need to happen before using your code.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.790
If it's helpful, include example code
to better illustrate your end user's

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.230
proper usage of your code.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.850
It's important to be mindful of
the assumptions you make about what

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.520
the user's expected to know.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.320
Remember, you're familiar
with your code already.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.030
So think about it from the perspective
of someone who's never seen this before.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.680
For instance,
if I were making eggs Benedict and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.230
my recipe called for a poached egg,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.690
I might be alienating new chefs by
not explaining what a poached egg is.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.880
Ultimately, the amount of detail that
you choose to include is up to you.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.470
But for particularly difficult concepts,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.870
it might be a good idea to
include some extra detail.
