00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.765
Imagine that the farmer is looking at a plot of land that's 1,900 meters wide

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:09.300
and 4,000 meters long. The irrigation system makes fields with a radius of 400

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.550
meters. To save some time, I did some of the math. And hopefully you can read

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.510
from my drawing, that the first row will need 800 meters of length. To get two

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.890
rows, you'll need 800 plus 400, times the square root of 3. Meters of length.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.119
To get three rows, you'll need 800 plus 2, times 400 times the square root of 3

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.186
meters of length. How many rows will fit on a piece of land that's 4,000 meters

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:39.360
long? My goal isn't to test you on geometry. Just to show an example of how to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.908
solve a mathematical problem with Java. Try a few times, and watch the solution

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:44.570
carefully if it doesn't work.
