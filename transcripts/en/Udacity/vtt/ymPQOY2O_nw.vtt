00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.140
Well now that we've got the exercise part out of

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.500
the way let's return to the details of property three and

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.480
see what it means to faithfully represent that have the refinement

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.130
faithfully represent the specification. In fact we have to check three things.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.140
There's three criteria that we have to look at. First of all,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.510
is the refinement adequate? That is, is our refinement rich enough to represent

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.820
all of the abstract situations? Second, is the refinement total? That is,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.210
are we sure that the cron, concrete level can't get into some state that

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.300
doesn't correspond to a possible abstract state? And the third criterion is,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.560
does the refinement model the abstract level. That is, is each

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.340
abstract operation correctly implemented by a concrete one? We'll look at all

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.890
three of these criteria separately, after we introduce a little more notation.
