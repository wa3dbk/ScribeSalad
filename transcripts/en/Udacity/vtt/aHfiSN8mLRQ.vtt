00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.380
In fact, that's exactly what a component diagram does.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.440
It's a static implementation view of how the components of a system fit

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.880
together. As far as UML is concerned, a, a component is a physical,

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.950
replaceable part of a system that packages implementation and conforms to and

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.360
provides a realization of the set of interfaces. It's usually used to model

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.990
code entities such as binaries, okay, that might perhaps come from a library.

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.920
And relationships in the diagram are meant intended to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.689
specify that one of the components uses the services of another component.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.630
This particular type of diagram can also be used to convey architecture.
