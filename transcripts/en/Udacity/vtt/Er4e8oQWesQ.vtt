00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.620
Alright, so now that we have a handle on this

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.000
kind of representation, let's look at some things we can do

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.208
with it. So, here's an example of a Bayesian network

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.280
with five variables. A, B, C, D, E. And let's pretend

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.150
that each one has some set of possible values. Could

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.090
be true/false. Could be red, green, blue. Whatever it happens to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.770
be. And these arrows again tell us about our conditional dependence

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.570
relationships. So how would we go about actually well, say sampling

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.960
from this distribution? So let's say that we wanted to just

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.190
as an example see what A, B, C, D, and E, might

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.510
look like in a, in a randomly selected example from the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.100
distribution that this network represents. So turns out what we can do

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.860
is that if we sample from A. Now A is specified

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.410
has no incoming arrows so it's not conditioned on anything in particular

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.645
so we can sample directly from A's distribution. We can do

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:50.629
the same for B and now C. If we want to sample

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.389
from C, we need to, make use of what values have already

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.190
been selected for A and B. Because C is conditioned on A

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.110
and B. But we can sample from that distribution. Each, each value

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.430
of A and B, each joint value of A and B gives

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.260
a distribution over C. And we do the same thing for D

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.540
and the same thing for E. And we're done. What we've sampled

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.820
from is actually the probability distribution,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.330
the joint probability distribution. So does

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.110
that seem like a useful thing to be able to do Charles?

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.590
&gt;&gt; It does seem like a useful thing to be able to do.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.138
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so here's just a quickie quiz. So just write

00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:24.558
a one word description that says, well in this sampling you'll notice

00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:27.500
I went a, b, c, d, and e. What ordering do

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.380
I need to do if I have a belief net like this

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.420
specified by this graphical structure with the arrows? If I want

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.150
to be able to sample it, I need to do it in

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.190
a particular order. Some orders are, are going to be problematic because

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.730
we haven't actually, you know, sampled the variables that it depends on.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.180
So, what ordering should we select for A, B, C, D, E? In general, what, what is

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.790
the name for that. So that we can

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.620
actually do this kind of sampling trick this way.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.
