00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.566
When starting the problem, we want to recall that the negative 3 has an exponent

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.699
of 1. Now, we can raise each of these bases to this power of 3. We multiply

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.119
every exponent on the inside of the parentheses by the exponent on the outside

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.411
of the parentheses. And we get negative 3 to the 3rd, b to the 12th, c to the

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:22.477
6th. The negative of 3 to the 3rd is negative 27. I regroup my numbers together

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:27.748
and my variables with the same basis together. Finally, I multiply the numbers

00:00:27.748 --> 00:00:32.810
and I add the exponents. Our final answer is negative 54 times B to the 15th

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.146
times c to the 11th. Fantastic work if you got it.
