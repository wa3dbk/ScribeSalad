00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So we've touched on Optimization--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the notion that you could take part of one Abstract Syntax Tree

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and replace it with something else, in order to make the program faster

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or use less power.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The cardinal rule of Optimization was:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You can't change the meaning of the program.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You have to respect the formal semantics

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or at least, that's what I've always told you.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But what if we break that law?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What if we want to change the meaning of a program?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For example, what if your program currently has a bug

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I want to change it so that the bug isn't there?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What if I want to fix your program--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Optimize it so that it is more correct,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
instead of being faster?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I've worked on just this sort of research project.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We call it Evolutionary Program Repair.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It involves using genetic algorithms or genetic programming--

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
computational analogs of Real World biological processes,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
like Crossover and Mutation.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We maintain a population of candidate programs that may fix your bug--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
just like you can imagine a population of animals on an island

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and then survival of the fittest allows some of them to stay,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the rest to die out.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If you're interested in this sort of research--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I affectionately call it Building Skynet

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
because we're building a program that builds other programs--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
there should be links below.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But one of the things that I want you to take away

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is that the concepts that we're covering in this class--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
notions like Abstract Syntax Trees

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
or replacing one expression with another--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
can be used in different contexts, to great effect.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It just requires creativity to know when you can bend the rules

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
without breaking them.

00:01:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That creativity is the essence of engineering.
