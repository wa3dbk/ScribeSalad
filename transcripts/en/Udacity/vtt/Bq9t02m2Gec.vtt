00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.010
The next phase is the reducer. In our case we

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.740
only have a single reducer because that's the HADOOP default. It

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.459
will get all the keys. The reducer is going to

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.430
get all the data coming in something like this. If we

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.309
had specified more than one reducer, each would receive some

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.170
of the keys along with the values for those particular keys.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.950
We're using HADOOP streaming here because we want to write our code

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.600
in PYTHON. Hadoop streaming allows you to write your mappers and

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.420
reducers in any language, rather than forcing you to

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.890
use Java. But the way reducers get their data

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.950
is a little bit tricky. As you can see,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.180
the data comes in streamed as lines of text.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.120
Each line contains a store name and the cost.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.810
The store names are sorted, which we're guaranteed because

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.370
of the shuffle and sort. So we know that

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.610
all lines for, say, Miami, are together. So if

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.540
we receive our data like this, what variables might we need to keep track of to

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.415
calculate the total sales per store? Do we need to know the cost of the previous

00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:03.850
line? Do we need to store the current cost? Or how about the total sales per

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.380
store? Do we need to save the previous

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.860
store, or the store that we're currently working with?
