00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We've been tasked with adding a while loop to our JavaScript interpreter

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that works just as it does in Python.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
To get acquainted, here's some JavaScript code that writes out 0, 2 and 4.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
As you may have guessed, we test the expression

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
if the expression, which is known as the condition, is true--then we evaluate the loop body.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
After evaluating the loop body, we test the conditional expression.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Again, if it's still true, then we evaluate the loop body, and we continue this process

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
until the conditional expression is false, at which point we continue on after the while loop.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So a while loop is a type of statement that has the keyword while, an expression,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then a compound statement--a sequence of statements.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In our parse tree, this is where we represented as a tuple, where the first element

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is the string while to indicate that this is a while loop.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The second element is the expression--the condition that determines

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
whether or not we execute the loop body.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The last element of the tuple is the sequence of statements that comprise the loop body.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So while tell you two ways to solve this--the first is going to re-use the Python while,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and the second is going to implement the while loop recursively.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Recall that in a programming language, you can have either a while loop

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
or recursive calls and still be equally powerful.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And so we're going to use that fact to implement our while with recursion. Here's one solution.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The first two lines, extract the conditional expression and the loop body from the parse tree

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and then we simply plug in the conditional expression and the loop body

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
into a Python while loop--so while the conditional expression is true

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
we're going to execute the loop body--pretty straightforward.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And here's my recursive solution--the first two lines are copied right out of the Python while

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
implementation--where we extract the conditional expression and the loop body in the same way.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We then evaluate the truthiness of our conditional expression.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If our conditional expression is true, we execute the statements in the while loop

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and then recurs on eval while.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Think about it for a moment, and we'll keep evaluating eval while

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
until the conditional expression is false under this environment.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
When it is false or if it ever is false, we simply don't do anything

00:02:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which is exactly the same functionality we had with the while loop implementation.
