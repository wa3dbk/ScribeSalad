00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, let's go shopping. What do we need to build a simple model of a wildfire.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The most important simplification that we are introducing is to treat

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the forest as though it was a football field.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We neglect height, we've reduced everything to two dimensions.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In two dimensions, we can already describe how heat diffuses, but in addition to that,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
there's also heat loss, there's wind, and first and foremost, there's combustion.

00:00:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now, we are going to look into these three starting with heat loss.
