00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this unit, we look into spatially extended phenomena governed by partial

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
differential equations rather than the ordinary differential equations that we have seen so far.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Equilibria, again, played a vital role and we saw that solving partial differential equations

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on the computer leads to severe numerical issues.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Next time, I'm going to give an overview on more advanced topics

00:00:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
including some hands-on experiments.
