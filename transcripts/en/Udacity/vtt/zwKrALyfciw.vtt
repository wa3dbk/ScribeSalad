00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.942
You now have knowledge of all the basic elements for creating a scene, objects,

00:00:02.942 --> 00:00:06.557
lights, and cameras. You have a considerably easier time of it than these

00:00:06.557 --> 00:00:09.906
people, as far as rendering the scene goes. The computer does all that for you,

00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:13.816
letting you focus on how to craft the objects themselves. In the next unit,

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:16.720
we'll show how to significantly increase the visual richness of models in your

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.810
virtual world, through the use of texture mapping.
