00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.663
We can see that there's a common factor of 2 in all three terms here. Each of

00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:09.471
these is divisible by 2, so we can write 2 times a polynomial. The polynomial

00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:13.820
that we get when we divide each term by 2. That way when we redistribute

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.054
multiplication by 2 to each of these terms, we end up with the original

00:00:18.054 --> 00:00:22.311
expressions. We have 2 times the quantity x squared plus 6 x plus 5.
