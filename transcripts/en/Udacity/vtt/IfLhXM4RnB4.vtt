00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.410
Now I'm going to walk you through the
process of getting your workspace set

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.620
up on Windows.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.880
There are also written instructions
in the instructor's notes.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.470
If you're using Mac or
Linux you should skip to the next video.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.940
First I'm going to configure git
bash to use a white background.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.110
If you prefer to use a dark
background you can skip this step.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.690
I'll click this icon, select
Defaults and go to the Colors tab.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.460
Then I'll set the screen background to
white and the screen text to black.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.190
Then I'll close and reopen Git Bash and
the screen is white now.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.590
Next I'm going to download
two files that are needed for

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.390
the setup I showed you earlier.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.160
One to enable tab completion, and one to
enable the git features in the prompt.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.790
The links to these files
are in the instructor's notes.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.355
To download each file,
I'll visit the page,

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:47.100
right-click anywhere on the page,
and select Save as.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
I'll save the file to
my Downloads directory.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.780
Next, I'll use Git Bash to move
the file to my home directory.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.880
My home directory is where I
start out when I open Git Bash.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.700
Or I can move to it by
typing cd ~ if I need to.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.960
Now I'll use the command
mv which stands for

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.850
move to move the file I just
saved to my home directory.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.480
Now the first argument is
the file I want to move,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.832
which is in my Downloads directory and
it's named git-completion.bash.txt.

00:01:15.832 --> 00:01:21.460
Now the .txt was created by the web
browser, but I don't actually want that.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.250
So I'll choose the name
git-completion.bash as the new name.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.610
And without specifying a directory it
will automatically get saved to my

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.970
current directory.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.580
Then I'll go through the same
process to save the second file in

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.014
the instructor's notes as git-prompt.sh.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.580
Next I'm going to create a file
called .bash profile which

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.340
contains configuration for Git Bash.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.730
I recommend using the configuration file
that I used when filming this course.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.910
To do this you can download the file
called bash_profile_course in

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.946
the downloadables section.

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:55.938
Then use Git Bash to move the file from
your Downloads directory or wherever you

00:01:55.938 --> 00:02:00.860
downloaded it to, to your home
directory and name it .bash_profile.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.550
Don't forget the dot at
the beginning of the name.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.410
If you already have a bash profile,
then don't run this command.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.669
Instead you can copy and

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.170
paste the content from my bash profile
into your existing one if you like.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.380
I don't see any changes to my prompt yet
and that's because I'll need to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.510
close and reopen Git Bash
before the changes take effect.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.800
I'll do that at the end of the video.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.840
In case you're curious about what's in
this batch profile, or if you'd like to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.880
pick and choose which lines to keep,
I'll go through what each line does.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.720
Don't worry if you don't understand
how each line works though.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.980
Even experienced UNIX programmers
frequently copy and paste this kind of

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.020
thing from their friends,
rather than writing it from scratch.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.710
This first line loads one of
the files you downloaded earlier, and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.600
enables tab completion.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.050
These lines define some colors,
which will be used in your prompt.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.500
This line loads the other file you
downloaded earlier, and it's necessary

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.170
for the git related stuff, like commit
IDs, to show up in your prompt.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.300
This line makes it so that an asterisk
will show up in your prompt if you

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.740
change something in a git repository.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.790
And this line sets the prompt.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.068
It will show your user name in purple,
the commit you have checked out and

00:03:06.068 --> 00:03:07.788
other git related stuff in green, and

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:11.790
the directory you're currently in
followed by a dollar sign in blue.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.710
Anything after that will be
displayed in the default color.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.570
If you're curious to learn more
about how prompts work in bash,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.270
check out the link in
the instructor's notes.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.100
But it's not necessary for
the rest of this course.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.630
Now I'll configure git to
use Sublime as my editor for

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.530
things like commit messages.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.620
You'll want to configure git to
use whatever editor you like, but

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.780
the process should be similar.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.570
First, I'll need to figure out
where Sublime was installed.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.100
For many people this is under
C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.230
And that's the case for me.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.080
If it's not here, you might also try
looking under C:\Program Files (x86).

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.800
Then I'll run the command git config
--global core.editor followed

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.450
by the text editor that I
want to use in double quotes.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.720
For me, this is Sublime, and I'll need
to specify the full path to Sublime.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.320
But for now, I'm just going to
type sublime as a placeholder,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.578
followed by -n -w.

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:08.120
The -n means Sublime will
open in a new window and

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.610
the -w means git will wait for you to
close Sublime before trying to continue.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.480
Now, I'm going to replace sublime with
the full path to Sublime in single

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.260
quotes, starting with
the directory you saw earlier, and

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.769
then I'll add sublimetext.exe.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.100
I know you can't see
the whole command here.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.830
You can copy and paste it from the
instructor's notes, although you'll have

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.820
to modify it if Sublime is installed
in a different location for

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.740
you, or if you're using a text
editor other than Sublime.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.700
It's also a good idea to make sure
you can launch your text editor from

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.410
within Git Bash.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.300
I'll show how to do this for Sublime.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.910
If you use another text editor,

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.310
I recommend you use Google to figure out
how to launch it from within Git Bash.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.400
I can already launch Sublime within
Git Bash by typing the full path to it,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.340
but I'd like to have a shortcut.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.230
To create one I'm going to add a line
to my bash profile using Sublime.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.470
Now opening the bash profile is going to
be a little tricky because anything with

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.750
a dot at the beginning of
the name is a hidden file and

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.910
it won't show up in most
file system explorers.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.820
To get around that I'm going to
temporarily rename the file to not

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.790
have a dot at the beginning of the name,
then I'll change it back once I finish.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.570
Then I'll open up Sublime and
open the file.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.209
I'll navigate to my home directory
under Computer &gt; C:\Users\cbuckey.

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.340
And then I'll select the bash_profile.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.710
Then I'll add this line to
create a command called subl,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.700
which will open Sublime.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.290
If you use Sublime, you can copy and

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.350
paste this line from
the instructor's notes.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.560
Although again you might need to modify
it to be the location Sublime is

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.000
installed for you.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.170
Note that this command also won't work
until you close and reopen Git Bash.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.790
Now that I'm done,

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.340
I'll rename the file to have a dot
at the beginning of the name again.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.290
If I didn't do this,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.210
then this file won't automatically
be loaded when Git Bash starts up.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.170
Next, I'll run two more Git
config commands that will come in

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.990
handy later this course.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.730
I'm going to run them now so
that all the configuration advice for

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.510
the course will be in one place.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.830
You can copy and paste these commands
from the instructor's notes.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.410
Finally, I'll close Git Bash and
reopen it.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.800
Now, I can see that my
prompt has changed.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.060
And if I want to view my
bash profile using Sublime,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.800
I can run subl .bash_profile.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.710
Remember to close and

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.530
reopen Git Bash when you're finished or
your changes won't take effect.
