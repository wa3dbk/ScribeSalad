00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.160
So, to summarize the Spinlock algorithm that we've seen

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.350
so far, we saw that the read spin on

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.450
read and spin on test and set and spin on test and set with a delay. All of

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.460
these spin algorithms, there's no fairness associated with them.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.450
And if you think about the ticket lock algorithm,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.900
it is fair but it is noisy. So, all of them are not quite there yet in terms of

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.150
our twin objectives of reducing latency and reducing

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.452
contention and if you think about it, let's

00:00:34.452 --> 00:00:36.300
say that you know, that currently this T1

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.540
has got this lock. And all of these guys

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.340
are waiting for this lock to get released.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.130
You know when T1 releases the lock, exactly one

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.380
of them is going to get it. Why should all of them be attempting to see if they,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.910
they've got the lock. Ideally, what we would

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.480
want is that when T1 releases a lock.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.880
Exactly one guy, one of these white reading

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.400
guys is, is a signal to indicate that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.480
you've got the lock. Because exactly one guys

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.700
can, can get the lock to start with.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.170
And therefore, ideally T1 should signal exactly on

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.270
the next thread and not all of them.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.650
Now, this is the idea. Behind, queueing locks that you're going to see next.
