00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.469
Let's also do a quiz
about the miss rate.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.680
Keep in mind that the hit rate is
equal to one minus the miss rate.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.310
The miss rate is how often
do we have a cash miss.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.005
The hit rate is how often
do we have a cash hit, and

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:18.155
the two adapt to one because we
either have one or the other.

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:21.628
So which of the following are true for
a well designed cache?

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:25.105
Is it true that in a well designed cache
the hit rate should be larger than

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:29.425
the miss rate, the hit rate should
be less than the miss rate,

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:34.075
that the hit and the miss rate should be
balanced, as close to equal as possible,

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:38.450
that the hit rate should be almost one,
that the miss rate should be almost one?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.940
Again, more than one, possibly all,
possibly none of them might be true, so

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.680
check all of those that are true for
a well designed cache.
