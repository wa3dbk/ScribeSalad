00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
The general way to calculate this is using logarithm.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.310
So you say 2 to the power of N, for example, is smaller than 1 billion,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.880
which means that N must be smaller than the logarithm base 2 of 1 billion,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.480
so N must be smaller than or equal to 29, which is exactly what we're going to put here.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.520
And of course you can do the same calculation for the other ones as well.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.730
So you get here the maximum problem size we can handle would be N equals 217.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.290
Here it's 119, 108, and 51.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.290
The interesting thing to see here I think is that you see how even small changes

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.800
in the base of the exponent can make a difference.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.490
So here the change is really small, from 1.21 down to 1.18,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.750
and already we could handle a problem size of 10 more.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.920
And of course this also shows you that the problem size that you can handle,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.190
at least in a worst case scenario, is about 4 times as much as you could handle

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.900
if you used a normal search tree.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.720
And of course, if you could find a really, really good search tree--

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.740
and there are some problems for which you can come close to 1.1, actually--

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.280
then you can handle problem sizes that are almost twice as much as this one over here.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.350
So it's really a significant improvement.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.350
It's not dramatic in the way that now we could solve instance sizes of thousands of vertices

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.080
or thousands of variables, but it's a significant improvement.

00:01:16.080 --> 99:59:59.000
But it's a significant improvement through using sophisticated algorithms.
