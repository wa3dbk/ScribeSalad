00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.238
Like all of our other equations, we can check to make sure that this solution

00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:07.980
is correct. If we substitute in positive root 6 into our equation, we'll notice

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.230
that it checks. The square root of 6 squared equals 6, and 5 times 6 equals 30.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.201
But remember, we can have the positive answer or the negative answer. So let's

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:23.712
check x equal to negative root 6. We plug in negative root 6 in for x, and

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:29.094
square it. Squaring a negative number always results in a positive. So we know

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:35.288
negative root 6 squared equals positive 6. Then we have 5 times 6, which is 30,

00:00:35.288 --> 00:00:40.256
so our answer checks. This is always a great way to check your answers. ANd

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:44.890
this reinforces why we have the plus or minus symbol. It's because we have two

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.079
answers.
