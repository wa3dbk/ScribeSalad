We've had a bit of a look at semantics,
how they're used by screen readers and

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.100
how we can structure HTML
to express those semantics.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.090
Later on, we'll explain what to do when
HTML doesn't have the semantics we need.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.865
But first, let's take a quick look at
some less obvious semantics and the way

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:20.420
assisted technology users can use them
to find their way around web pages.
