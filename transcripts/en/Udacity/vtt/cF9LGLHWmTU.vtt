00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.740
We don't really need any formula for this one. This is 45 degrees and this is

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.320
45 degrees, so these angles must be 90 degrees. What that means is that these

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.150
two legs of the triangle must be the same. So half of the height, distance

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.197
equals 10. However, if you use the formula, that's fine too. You'll get the

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:18.850
same answer.
