00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here comes the answer--as you probably found out for yourself, the program indeed

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
raises an exception that is the quote condition holds, and this confirms our hypothesis.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So at this point, let us recall what we have seen.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The error is due to the quote condition evaluating to true. We've seen that and confirm the experiments.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Before, we already had seen that, the error is due to tag being set, was rejected,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that is tag is not being set.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Our initial hypothesis and our initial observation, double quotes are stripped from the input,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so we know at this point double quotes are stripped, tag is not being set,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the quote condition evaluates to true.
