00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.850
So for all the same reasons,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.640
every time the interpreter visits the middle line of the carlike decorator,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.220
a new function will be generated as that car's .move method.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.630
Depending on how many cars we make, this could take up a lot of memory.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.810
But there's a slight advantage to putting the .move method inside the body of

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.720
the carlike decorator function.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.870
Now that the .move function is being created every time,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.590
each one has access to a unique closure scope created when we invoke

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.620
the carlike function, thus, we don't need to rely on the keyword, this, anymore.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.310
So refactor this code for me.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.480
Try to make it work such that the move method does not even refer to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.250
the parameter, this.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.260
It accomplishes all the same thing but without using the keyword, this.
