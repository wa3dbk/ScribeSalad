00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.983
I haven't talked about texture access in fragment shaders. The short answer is,

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:06.894
you can access textures in fragment shaders. The theory of sampling and

00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:10.784
filtering is the same as you've already learned in previous lessons. Most of

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:15.476
the rest is just the syntax of setting up the texture access. The key bit is

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:19.440
that in the shader you use the texture 2D function. This gives back the color

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.998
from the texture which you then use as you wish. Search the Three.js code base

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:27.740
for this keyword and you'll find more than 40 shaders that use texture access.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.822
The main file for material shading is WebGLShaders.js, and it's worth your time

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:35.228
to give it a look if you want to become better with shaders. The other function

00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:38.708
to look for is textureCube for cube maps, which takes a 3D direction as an

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:43.376
input. Many of the rest of the shaders perform image processing, where the

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:47.182
pixels of the image are used to form another image. Let's take a concrete

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:51.006
example. You want to convert a color image to grayscale. The formula is

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.998
luminance equals this much red, this much green, and this much blue. This

00:00:54.998 --> 00:00:59.370
formula is for linearized colors, and luminance is intensity, the grayscale.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.310
There's also another formula for luma, for when the inputs are not gamma

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.865
corrected. It's surprising to me that in both formulas how important green is

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.857
and how little blue matters. Whichever formula you use, you might think you

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:13.980
could simply add it as a final step in a fragment shader. However, transparency

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.568
again is a problem. You want to apply this formula as a post-process. That is,

00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:22.449
you want to convert to grayscale after the whole scene is rendered. But by then

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.406
it's too late. The image has already been sent to the screen. Well, in fact,

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:28.986
you can send the image off-screen and have it become a texture. This is called,

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:32.981
simply, an offscreen texture, pixel buffer, or render target. This texture is

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:35.848
not typically not a powers of two texture, it's not normally 512 by 512, or

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:40.203
anything that you'd use to make a mipmap chain. Our goal is to perform image

00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:43.934
processing on this so-called texture. We want to read a pixel and convert it to

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:47.275
gray. You'd think there'd be some mode that could just take one texel and spit

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:49.930
it out to a new pixel, but the GPU is optimized for drawing triangles and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.920
accessing textures. The way we use this texture is by drawing a single

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.162
rectangle with UV coordinates that exactly fill the screen. You'll hear this

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:02.718
called a screen-filling quad. The UV values are then used in the fragment

00:02:02.718 --> 00:02:06.150
shader to precisely grab the single texel that corresponds to our final output

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.725
pixel on the screen, one for one. This sounds inefficient, and in a certain

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:14.588
sense it is. But this process is fast enough that often a considerable number

00:02:14.588 --> 00:02:18.590
of post-processing passes can be done in each frame. In Three.js, the Effect

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.022
Composer class let's you create and chain different passes together with just a

00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:26.630
few lines of code. For our grayscale post-process, the vertex shader is along

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.948
these lines. This is almost as simple as a vertex shader can get. It copies

00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:34.059
over the UV value and projects the screen-filling quadrilateral to clip

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.002
coordinates. The whole point of rendering the rectangle is to force the

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:41.966
fragment shader to be evaluated at every pixel. The fragment shader code is

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:45.440
also quite simple. The texture is accessed by the screen location, essentially.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.215
So each textel will be associated with its corresponding output pixel. We use

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:52.448
the color of this textel to get the grey scale color, in this case using the

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:56.130
luma equation. This color is then saved to the fragment's output color and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.840
we're done. But we don't have to stop there. Multiple post-process passes can

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.874
be done, and it's often necessary or even more efficient. For example, a blur

00:03:04.874 --> 00:03:09.134
can be done in two passes, a horizontal blur and then a vertical blur. Doing so

00:03:09.134 --> 00:03:12.914
results in fewer texture look-ups than a single pass. Multiple passes can be

00:03:12.914 --> 00:03:15.950
quite memory efficient as the input texture from one pass can become the output

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.322
texture for the next, and vice versa. This process is called ping ponging, as

00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:24.236
the flow of data goes back and forth. Here the horizontal blur uses the left

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:28.237
image as input, the right for output. The vertical blur uses the right as

00:03:28.237 --> 00:03:31.760
input, left as output. Say we now want to convert to gray scale, we'd add

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.944
another pass and reverse the direction again. Here's an example of grayscale in

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:39.324
action. The critical idea here is that we can do all sorts of things in this

00:03:39.324 --> 00:03:43.423
fragment shader. We can sample nearby texels and blend them together to blur

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:48.016
the image, detect edges, or 100 other operations. We can chain together each

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:51.713
post-process to feed the next. This demo by Felix Turner shows some of the many

00:03:51.713 --> 00:03:55.325
effects you can achieve. Three.js, in fact, has lots of post-processing

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:59.760
operations in its library, and it's easy to add your own. I highly recommend

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.010
looking at the additional course materials for links to Felix's tutorial and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.169
other worthwhile resources.
