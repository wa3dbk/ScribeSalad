00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.240
Using what we found in Google Trends,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.790
you can further explore keyword
options using Google Keyword Planner.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.490
Keyword Planner is an awesome tool
that's similar to Google Trends in some

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.870
ways, like identifying related keywords
and seeing historical statistics.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.160
But the biggest difference is we get to
narrow down options by their performance

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.680
and what we can afford.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.160
This will help us make
our plan more realistic.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.450
And we'll support our
decision about keywords and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.880
budget when we build
our ad words campaign.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.330
Now the biggest takeaways for

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.890
keyword planner are first
expanding your keyword options.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.350
Based on your first set of keywords from
Google Trends, you can get ideas to more

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.650
relevant keywords, and hopefully ones
you haven't actually thought of before.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.380
Second, you can use it as a simulation.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.850
For different bids, budgets and learn
what estimated number of clicks and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.430
conversions you might get
from certain keywords.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.130
This will help you choose
your bid on every keyword and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.250
plan your budget accordingly for
you AdWords campaign.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.650
However, if your keywords are really
popular among advertisers

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.230
it might be challenging and
expensive for you to bid on clicks.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.790
We'll learn more in lesson four about
how your placement in a search results

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.320
list is a combination of your
performance and your bid.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.140
Now, as a beginner it's
usually pretty tricky for you.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.550
It'll take you a while to perform
better than the existing players.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.570
Especially if it's a crowded market,
like insurance, for example.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.730
And obviously your advertising
budget is going to be a little bit

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.270
lower than those big name advertisers.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.450
Make sure you're focusing on keywords
that are really specific for

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.760
your added value.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.980
That way you'll perform better than your
competitors and have fewer competitors.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.830
For us, for example we learned
that in Google Trends pet

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.950
care is a more popular search
term than pet sitting.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.360
So we may want to go with that search
term and reach a bigger audience.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.310
However the truth of the matter is,
then we would be competing with

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.790
veterinarian services, insurance for
pets and other advertisers.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.730
Who have a much larger budget
than we do at Embarkment.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.770
So rather than having us walk through
Google's Keyword Planner with you.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.130
We highly encourage you to check
out Google's documentation,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.639
it's really wonderful for
people of all skill sets.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.200
So if you're an expert
at Keyword Planner or

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.030
just starting out, the documentation
is really easy and engaging.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.910
There's a link to a video in the
instructor notes that talks more about

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.450
Keyword Planner as well as
a link to the documentation.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.620
This documentation will
be endlessly helpful for

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.750
you when you're exploring keywords and
other Google tools.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.900
It's great practice to get
comfortable exploring documentation

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.610
because technology is ever changing.
