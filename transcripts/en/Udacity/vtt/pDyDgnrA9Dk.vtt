00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.474
Our interval would be negative 2 3rds, positive 5. We know we can use brackets

00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:09.628
on the ends here since negative 2 3rd and 5 make this left-hand side equal to

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:14.888
0. Since this is a less than or equal to symbol, we get to include these two

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:19.880
values. So here's our answer written in interval notation And here's our answer

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.120
written on a number line.
