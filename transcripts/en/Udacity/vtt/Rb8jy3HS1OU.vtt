00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
If you remember in our last slide, one of the choices was whether you were using

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.120
physical or virtual distribution channels.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.020
Let's take a look at virtual channels, which are not only the web but also might include

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.680
iPhone apps or the Cloud as well.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.750
The first choice might be dedicated e-commerce.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.310
That is you might have a website that belongs to you and that is one choice.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.930
Another choice is that you might have an app that runs on a mobile device,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.250
and mobile devices like Android or Apple and others and Microsoft require you to use

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.000
their platform app store and so that might be a choice.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.810
Another choice is to use two-step distribution that is there might be other distributors

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.510
who have major web presences like Amazon, Wal-Mart, other local and regional stores.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.000
And you might actually sell your virtual products through theirs or physical products.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.500
You might use an aggregator. An aggregator is somebody who takes a vertical market approach.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.660
Insurance, shoes, etc. Some examples are, for insurance, Lending Tree or Zappos.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.110
Another might be social commerce.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.510
Social commerce sites for distribution might include Facebook, Twitter, etc.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.580
Zynga, which is a video game company, uses predominantly Facebook as its platform.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.390
And then finally flash sales.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.550
Examples include Groupon and Living Social.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.080
Now, the first instinct of almost any startup founder is when you understand all the choices for

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.390
distribution channels is to say yes.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.980
And the question is, yes to what? You can't afford to pick multiple channels on day one.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:51.210
Most successful startups pick one of these and then may eventually expand into others.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.490
So the question for you is what's going to be your first distribution channel

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.160
on the web, Cloud, or for mobile devices?
