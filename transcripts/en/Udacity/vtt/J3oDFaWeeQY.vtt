00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.330
A fair pervasive violation of the end-to-end argument are

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.070
home gateways, which often perform something called network address

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.800
translation. Now on a home network we have many

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.240
devices that connect to the network, but when we

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.410
buy service from our internet service provider we're typically

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.750
only given one public IP address. And yet we

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.170
have a whole variety of devices that we may

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.630
want to connect. Now the idea behind network address translation

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.510
is that we can give each of these devices a private IP address and there

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.520
are designated regions of the IP address space

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.380
that are for private IP addresses. One of

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.960
those is 192.168.0.0/16 and there are others, which

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.160
you go read about in RFC 3130. Each

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.790
one of these devices in the home gets

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.960
its own private IP address. The public internet,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.640
on the other hand, sees a public IP address

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.480
which typically is the IP address provided by the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.160
internet service provider. When packets traverse the home router,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.540
which is often running a network address translation process,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.260
the source address of every packet is rewritten to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740
the public IP address. Now when traffic comes back

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.910
to that public IP address, the network address translator

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.140
needs to know which device behind the NAT the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.650
traffic should be sent to. So it uses a mapping of port numbers to identify

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.670
which device the return traffic should be sent

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.790
to in the home network. So the NAT

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.620
or the network address translator maintains a table

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.500
that says packets with the source IP address

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.440
of 192.168.1.51 and source port 1000 should be

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.590
rewritten to a source address of the public

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.960
IP address and a source port of 50878. Similarly, packets with a source IP

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.357
address of 192.168.1.52 and source port of

00:01:52.357 --> 00:01:55.420
1000 should be rewritten to the public IP

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.290
address and a source port of 50879. Then when traffic returns to the NAT to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.660
one of these addresses the NAT knows

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.030
that it needs to rewrite the destination address

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.889
on the return traffic to the appropriate destination

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.870
IP address and port that's in the private

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.100
network. So for outbound traffic, the NAT device

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.310
creates a table entry mapping the computer's local

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.630
IP address and port number to the public

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.310
IP address at a different port number. And

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.980
replaces the sending computer's non-routable IP address with

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.830
the gateway or the NAT public IP address.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.380
It also replaces the sender's source port with a

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.090
different source port that allows it to demutiplex the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.760
packets sent to this return address and port. For

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.710
inbound traffic to the home network, the NAT checks the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.580
destination port on the packet, and based on the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.750
port, it rewrites the destination IP address and port to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.360
the private IP address in the table before forwarding

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.180
the traffic to a local device in the home network.
