00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.388
We've already talked a lot about
finding features, detecting them,

00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:05.310
describing them and matching them.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.400
And so, we're not going to do much more
in terms of that feature matching for

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.000
motion, okay?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.180
Instead, what we're going to be doing
over the next couple times is focusing

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.220
on the dense methods where
we look at the derivatives,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.860
we look at how things change.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.510
And just to sort of spill
the beans all the way at the end,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.080
the best methods currently,
use a combination of the,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.300
the feature to get
the long-range matches and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.740
local gradients in order to
get the dense shorter range.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.590
So you already know about
the feature stuff, so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.940
now we need to go over
the dense direct stuff.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.480
And that's what we're going to be
doing over the next couple of lessons.
