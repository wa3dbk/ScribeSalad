When you have an interface, and you have classes that can make use of it, those

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:09.121
classes need to implement it. Here's how that works in Java. The class,

00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:15.376
declares that it implements, the Drawable interface. It provides a draw method,

00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:20.454
and then it also needs to put in some implementation. The class is free to

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:25.640
provide other methods that have nothing to do with the interface. You can have

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.813
as many classes as you like that implement the particular interface. Here the

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:32.360
Dog class does the same.
