00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.840
You'll recall in lesson one, that
according to Jakob Nielsen's research

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.460
with only 3 users, upwards of 65% of the
issues in a prototype can be uncovered.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.370
And with only 5 users, upwards of 75% of
the issues can be found in a prototype.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.190
It won't make much sense to do more than
ten research tests on the same prototype

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.079
because of the law of
diminishing returns.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.140
The key to effectively
applying Nielsen’s research,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.000
is getting the feedback from three to
five users early on, and continuously

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.490
iterating on changes, as you’ve made
incremental changes to your design.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.400
So after you’ve made your
first round of feedback,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.010
make the changes you’ve
received to your designs.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.559
Then, go for
another round of three to five users.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.600
After each round or

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.860
iteration you'll find that your
designs will improve efficiently.
