00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.314
This equation would have a radius of 8. Great thinking if you found that

00:00:04.314 --> 00:00:08.642
number. We know that the general equation for a circle centered at the origin

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:15.455
is x squared, plus y squared, equals r squared. So, we know that r squared must

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:20.578
equal the number 64. Its the number on the end of the equation. So, solving for

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:24.546
r will take the square root of both side so, one r equals positive 8, and I use

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:30.654
the positive root only since we are dealing with radius. A distance from the

00:00:30.654 --> 00:00:35.120
center to the points on the circle. If we actually graph the circle, we could

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.755
easily see that the center is at the origin. And that the radius is 8, the

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.039
distance to any point on the circle.
