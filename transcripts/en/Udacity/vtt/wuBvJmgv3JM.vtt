00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.520
We found out that the measure of the angle was 10 degrees. We really should make

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:08.914
sure that this is correct. Let's make sure we can check this with our ideas of

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:13.069
supplement and complement. We know the complement of angle x has to be 80

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.488
degrees, since 80 and 10 make 90 degrees. And the supplement of angle x has to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.362
be 170 degrees, since these two add up to 180. So, in my equation, I can replace

00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:27.536
the complement with 80 degrees and the supplement with 170 degrees. This allows

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:32.090
me to check my work. I want to know if this answer is really true. Was the

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:37.242
supplement 10 more than two times the complement? And yes, 170 degrees is equal

00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:42.648
to 170 degrees. Our supplement was double the complement plus 10. So we can be

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.555
assured that our answer was correct. The unknown angle was 10 degrees.
