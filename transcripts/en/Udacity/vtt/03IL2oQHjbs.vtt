00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.190
Now let's take a look at the life
of a Cast sender application.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.780
First off you should know the Cast SDK
uses an asynchronous callback design

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.590
to inform the sender applications
of events, like connects and

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.170
disconnects to the Cast device, as well
as whether commands were received.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.510
For example, let's say a Sender
app sends a message to a receiver.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.820
To do so, you'll implement a couple
of callbacks provided by the SDK so

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.190
your app can be informed
of whether it was received.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.910
We'll go into each of the steps of
a sender life cycle by looking at

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.975
the CastHelloText example which you
can find in the instructor notes.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.750
The reason I like this sample as
a teaching tool is because it contains

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.030
a one file sender app
inside of main activity.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.470
The only other files we need to look
at are manifest and our menu XML.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.530
And again, you can find
the corresponding receiver app

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.440
inside the receiver folder.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.070
Now off the bat,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.850
you should know that some of the code
we'll cover is going to be simplified by

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.310
the CastCompanionLibrary which we'll get
to in the next section of the course.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.300
But it's important to see how it works
from the ground up when you get started.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.460
Also, just a reminder,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.850
don't use this project as the starting
point for your integration.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.650
Use Cast videos instead.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.290
Let's start with the manifest.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.970
The minimum Android SDK version
supported by Cast is 9,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.570
which is Gingerbread, or version 2.3.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.630
Next the applications theme
needs to be correctly set based

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.730
on the minimum Android SDK version.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.970
For example you might need to use
a variant of Theme.AppCompat.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.450
Believe it or not that's it for
the manifest.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.040
Of course in a production app with
the CastCompanionLibrary you'll need

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.120
a couple of permissions.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.900
And we'll get to those later on.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.010
Now on to the sender application
inside of main activity.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.860
Our first job is to initialize
the Cast API, and to do so

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.090
we'll obtain an instance
of the media router.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.440
You'll need to hold on
to this instance for

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.080
the lifetime of you sender application.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.830
And a good place to do it
is inside your onCreate.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.570
At this point, the user has
launched her sender application and

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.320
we've initialized the API.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.400
Now it's time to discover
available Cast devices.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.090
Behind the scenes the media
router detects Cast devices,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.710
both of the local network and
by proximity.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.330
We'll need to filter those Cast devices
for just ones that can run your

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.690
application, and to do so
we'll use the MediaRouteSelector.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.200
This is important because if you
have a video playing application,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.090
you wouldn't want to show the user
an option to Cast to a stereo.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.500
Our application ID by the way is
defined in our strings.xml file, but

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.960
here it's displayed by
Android Studio for convenience.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.729
And remember this ID corresponds
to the customer receiver app

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.380
already published for this application.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.490
But in our own app of
course we have our own.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.630
Next up we'll need
a MediaRouterCallback.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.596
This is used to inform our sender app
when the user selects a device they

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:18.260
want to cast to.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.360
And we'll see how they do that
with Cast menu in just a sec.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.260
First notice that our activity
extends ActionBarActivity.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.430
There are a couple of different
ways to add the Cast button but

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.706
the easiest is to use
the MediaRouter ActionBar provider.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.678
Here's how we add the Cast button
to the ActionBarCompat using

00:02:34.678 --> 00:02:37.630
the MediaRouterAction bar
provider in our menu XML.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.792
And inside onCreateOptionsMenu,
we assign the MediaRouteSelector to

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:43.240
the MediaRouteActionProvider
in the ActionBar menu.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.480
Now to trigger the discovery
of Cast devices,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.660
we add the MediaRouterCallback
to the MediaRouter instance.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.060
Note that we're doing this inside
of our activities onStart method.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.650
To conserve battery power, we remove the
callback when our activity has stopped.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.620
At this point, the user can select a
Cast device using the menu in their app.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.530
Once they do, our sender application's
informed via the MediaRouterCallback.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.147
And you can see that happening here
inside the onRouteSelected method.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.700
Now it's time to launch
the receiver app.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.360
To do so, we'll need an instance
of the Google API client,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.620
which contains the Cast APIs.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.840
We use the connection callbacks
to be notified whether or

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.050
not the connection was successful.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.600
And once the connection is confirmed,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.520
our sender application can launch
the receiver app by specifying

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.780
the application ID we found on
the Cast developer console.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.730
At this time we'll set
a couple of callbacks.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.730
And if you see how far to
the right we're getting indented,

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.640
you'll know this is never a good sign.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.570
Fortunately this task is greatly
simplified by the CastCompanionLibrary

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.280
we'll get to in a sec.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.400
Now that the receiver's launched it's
time to control it by sending messages.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.060
To do so, we'll need to set
up a custom message channel.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.620
The sender can use this channel to
send string messages to the receiver.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.370
Each custom channel is
defined by unique namespace.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.960
It's possible to create
multiple channels,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.040
just make sure they
all have unique names.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.430
There's some rules about this namespace

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.730
that you can find in
the instructor notes.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.510
Once the sender application is
connected to the receiver the custom

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.040
channel can be set up.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.117
And as usual we create some
callbacks being informed if there

00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:07.780
are messages we've received.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.880
Again this is simplified by the CCL.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.249
Now that our channel's set up,

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.460
the sender application can use it to
send string messages to the receiver.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.120
A good trick here,
if you need to send a complex message,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.459
is to simply encode it in JSON, and
then decode it on the receiver side.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.240
And the response from

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.380
the receiver is then captured
using the callback we set up.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.682
Now it's time to handle
disconnecting from the receiver,

00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:28.670
when the user selects this
option on the Cast menu.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.680
You can see how that's done
inside our teardown method.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.400
That was a quick tour of the basics
of the sender lifestyle.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.260
Next up we'll learn about
the CastCompanionLibrary or CCL for

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.870
short, which greatly simplifies
working with Cast on Android.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.450
Here's an optional learning exercise you
can do if you really want to learn how

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.260
to write Cast applications.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.520
Now you know the basics of senders and
receivers.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.300
The best next step is to try and
write your own sender.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.860
What I'd recommend doing is creating
a new Android Studio project

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.360
with a blank activity for
a phone or a tablet.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.040
Next, add simple Cast support to it so
you can send a message to the custom

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.120
receiver we already have
from our HelloCast example.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.870
To help you with this,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.490
you can find links to documentation
in the instructor notes, and

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.440
if you can do this successfully,
you should feel really good.
