00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.980
If you ask a database expert what's the
best way to save images in a database,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.130
you'll likely hear this rule of thumb.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.480
If the image is really, really small,
then save it into the database.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.010
If it's bigger, save it in a file and

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.390
save the name or path of that
file into the database itself.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.150
Guess what?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.330
With Core Data, you don't have
to bother with that either.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.480
It will do it for you just by
selecting an option in the data model.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.190
Let's go ahead and modify our model
by adding a new photo entity.
