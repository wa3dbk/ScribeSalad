00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.890
When hiring new employees especially the
very first few, you want an employees

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.270
that fundamentally believe in the vision
and the mission of the company.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.230
Because that will dictate
the culture going forward, you want

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.210
the first few employees to really set
the tone for everyone that comes after.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.490
So whatever environment, whatever
culture you're trying to instill.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.070
Those early employees will
help you determine that.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.260
So, if your company's such that work
life balance is very important and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.540
you work 9 to 6 very hard and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.660
then everybody goes home, find
employees that are aligned with that.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.580
If your company culture is different,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.520
find employees that aligned with
whatever vision you have for

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.470
your company because that will clearly
determine a lot on future hires and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.050
the tone of the business and
your style of going forward.
