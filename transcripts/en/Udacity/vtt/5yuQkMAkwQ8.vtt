00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.451
But where does this show up in my equation? If we subtract 4 from both sides,

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:09.100
we're going to isolate the absolute value. We'll get the distance of p plus 3

00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:13.576
alone. This is where the 8 shows up. The absolute value or the distance of p

00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:18.159
plus 3 from 0 must be 8. When solving absolute value equations, we need to make

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:22.723
sure we get the absolute value symbol on one side of the equation alone. That

00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:26.736
way, we can represent the distance. Once we isolate the absolute value, we want

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:30.819
to check. We want to make sure that it's greater than or equal to 0. Remember,

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.949
distance is always positive, so if we had a negative answer on this side, there

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:38.990
would be any number that could make it true, there'd be no solution. This is a

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.713
difficult concept and it's one that we'll stumble upon, too, later.

00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:47.299
So now, we're back into the same case before. The value of p plus 3 could be 8

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:52.038
units to left of 0 at negative 8, or it could be 8 units to the right of 0, at

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.103
positive 8. So, let's split this equation up into 2 equations, setting p plus 3

00:00:57.115 --> 00:01:01.460
to negative 8 and p plus 3 equal to positive 8. Just like from before. And at

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:05.652
this point, you might even be able to solve it in your head, which is great. For

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:09.492
more complicated questions, it's best to stick to the equation solving.

00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:13.634
Subtracting 3 from both sides, p could equal 5. And subtracting 3 from both

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:17.910
sides, p could equal negative 11. So, the solution set or the values for p, are

00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:21.834
negative 11 and 5. And just like all our other equations, we can check these

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:25.302
values in our original equation to see if we are right. That's one of the

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:29.109
beauties of mathematics. This can help build your confidence in math. If this

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:32.939
don't check, maybe it's a good idea to look back at your work. You might rethink

00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:34.622
your process or catch a small error.
