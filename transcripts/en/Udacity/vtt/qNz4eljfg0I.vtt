00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.244
Let's take a look at this function,

00:00:04.244 --> 00:00:09.686
f(x) is equal to x minus
1.5 squared plus 0.5.

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:14.120
That function is a parabola
that looks something like this.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.587
It's centered horizontally at 1.5,

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:23.964
and its minima is here at 0.5.

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:28.430
Now, the minimizer doesn't know that.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.720
We can tell it by looking
at the equation, but

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.460
the minimizer has to
figure it out on its own.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.390
So let's suppose we tell it,
hey minimizer, why don't you start

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.168
with a guess of 2.0 and see if you
can figure out from there what it is?

00:00:44.168 --> 00:00:47.456
So the minimizer says,
okay, I'll give it a go.

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:50.560
[LAUGH] And here's what it does.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.530
First thing it does is it
checks the value at 2.0,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.890
it turns out that that's about 0.75.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.910
It then tests the value nearby,
say here and here.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.640
And it finds out that this equation has
a slope about like that, at this point.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.440
Now, it's trying to minimize, and so

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.290
what it does is it marches downhill,
it's called gradient descent.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.630
And it tries another value
down along that slope.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.960
Gets a particular value here,
tries another one, and so on.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.268
And eventually, it narrows and

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:37.158
it discovers that 1.5 is the value for
x at the minima.

00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:41.760
And the value of y there is 0.5.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.117
Now, the example I gave you for

00:01:44.117 --> 00:01:48.660
sort of marching down this
gradient descent is one method.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.330
There are many variations
on that method,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.790
that different kinds of minimizers use.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.290
And Scipy, the library that we're using,
has many of those options.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.410
And you can choose different
ones according to your taste.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.273
We're going to stick with one particular
approach through our examples here.

00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:09.240
But you ought to experiment and
try some of the other ones as well.
