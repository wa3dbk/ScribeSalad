00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.110
I think it will be helpful for us to visualize the relationship between, total

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.768
income and total pay in taxes. So, let's graph it. If we want to graph income

00:00:09.768 --> 00:00:14.746
on the horizontal axis. In taxes owed on the vertical axis, both measured in

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:19.670
dollars. What will the slope of the line we draw represent. Will it represent

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.551
the tax rate, written as a percent? The tax rate written as a decimal, the

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:28.189
total tax paid, or the total income earned.
