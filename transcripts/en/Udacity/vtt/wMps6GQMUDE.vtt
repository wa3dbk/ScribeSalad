00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.544
By providing the smart connection to
the rest of the world while respecting

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:08.159
the user's attention,
Android Wear feels personal and global.

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:13.395
It's simple and smart, and
it's unobtrusive and ever-ready.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:16.610
Now applications that represent
the following principles

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.190
will feel most at home in
the overall Android Wear experience.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.700
Wearable apps are aware of
the user's context, their time,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.330
location, and physical activity.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.240
Now the apps use this information
to insert cards into the stream

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.910
when they become relevant.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.405
This makes Android Wear timely,
relevant, and very specific.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:42.484
A classic wristwatch is designed to let
you see the time in a split second and

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:44.246
get on with what you were doing.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:46.590
And it should be the same for
Android Wear.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.400
The less time it takes to use your
software, the more time the user can be

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.860
present in whatever they're doing,
and the more overall value they get.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.580
Android wear is fast,
sharp, and immediate.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.600
Remember what we looked
at just a moment ago.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.830
The wearable can talk to the user, and
the user can ask things of the wearable.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.470
Now you can visualize this much
like a personal assistant.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.052
It knows you and your preferences.

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:14.655
It'll only interrupts you when
absolutely necessary, and

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:17.990
it's always on hand to
provide a ready answer.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.920
Android Wear is helpful,
it's respectful, and it's responsive.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.520
Android Wear focuses on
simple interactions,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.870
only requiring input by the user
when absolutely necessary.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.517
Most inputs are based around
touch swipes and voice.

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:36.750
And inputs requiring fine-grained
finger movements are to be avoided.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.700
The Android Wear is gestural,
simple, and fast.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.110
Now keep these in mind as you dream
up your Android Wear experience.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.290
As with everything here,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.320

detail in our documentation.
