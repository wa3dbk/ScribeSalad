00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's make sure that we all have the same idea

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about how that architecture is going to go--with a quiz.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm going to write down candidate steps--or candidate parts--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of our algorithm's design,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and you're going to tell me which parts are wrong

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or if there's a part that's shown in the wrong order.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So here I've written 5 possible steps,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
in a particular order,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that our Web browser might follow and I want you

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to put a check mark--in this multiple multiple choice quiz--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
next to each step that's either erroneous

00:00:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or out of order.
