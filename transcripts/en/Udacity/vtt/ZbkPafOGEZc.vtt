00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.870
When writing the expressions, it's best to use x for the longer leg. We know

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.410
that since the hypotenuse is 5 inches longer than the longer leg and the

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.490
shorter leg is 5 inches shorter than that longer leg. The longer leg is the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.812
connecting thread that links the relationships of the sides together. So, if we

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:22.372
let X equal the longer leg, then the hypotenuse will be 5 units longer or x

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:30.410
plus 5 and the shorter leg will be x minus 5. 5 units less than the longer leg.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.270
Great thinking if you found these 3 expressions this one was challenging.
