00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.910
So now that we have a basic
understanding of how the overall file

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.680
system works, why don't we take a look
at what one of these AppLockers or

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.160
Sandboxes looks like on the inside.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.130
When an app is installed,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.330
its Sandbox is created with
several pre-made containers.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.340
The Bundle Container contains
the application itself, or

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.100
more specifically, a directory
that holds the executable code and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.220
resources, like images and sound files
or whatever else is used by that code.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.320
The Data Container,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.000
like its name might suggest,
holds all the user and app data.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.050
Within it are three sub-containers.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.640
The documents, library,
and temp directories.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.450
Temp is used for

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.010
storing very temporary data that doesn't
need to be persisted across launches.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.100
So we're not going to be talking
about this directory in this course.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.300
Documents and library are the
directories you want to focus on.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.525
Documents is where user data should go,
and library is for

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:51.450
non-user data files or files that you
don't want to expose to the user.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.565
Both of these directories contain
a few standard sub-directories,

00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:57.418
such as Documents/Inbox,
Library/Applications Support,

00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:00.030
Library/Caches, and several others.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.530
The caches directory is important,
and we'll revisit it

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.710
along with the documents and library
directories later in this lesson.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.650
Note that you can also create
sub-directories of your own to better

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.634
organize your files.

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:14.820
At app runtime, an app may also request
access to additional containers,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.980
such as the iCloud container.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.090
So now that we have an idea of how the
file system works and what the Sandboxes

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.320
inside the file system look like, we can
probably revisit our initial question.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.940
Where does NS user defaults live?

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.000
If you guessed within the data
container, you'd be right.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.740
It lives right here within the data
container inside of library.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.618
Its actual path looks
something like this.

00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:39.390
The file, info.myapp.mobile.plist,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.940
is the file that contains the saved and
its user defaults.
