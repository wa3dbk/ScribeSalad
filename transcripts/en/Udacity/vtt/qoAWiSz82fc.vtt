00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.478
For all real numbers we want the coefficient in front of the i to be 0 so b

00:00:04.478 --> 00:00:09.246
needs to equal 0. That way we'll get rid of the second term and only have the

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:14.192
constant a, which is a real number. For imaginary numbers we need a to be equal

00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:18.935
to 0. That way all we'll have left is b times i the imaginary part of a complex

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:19.515
number.
