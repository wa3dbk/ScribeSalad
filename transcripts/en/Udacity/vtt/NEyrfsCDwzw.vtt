If you take a look at our JSON file, this is where the layer data exists to

00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:07.409
describe what we want to draw. First, we need to loop through each layer and

00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:11.078
then for each layer loop through the tile IDs contained in the data of each

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.876
layer. Now, if you recall a significant portion of these IDs will be set to

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:18.624
zero. That indicates not to draw any tile at that specific location. If the

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:22.210
given ID is not zero, then we go ahead and grab the packet information by

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.775
calling the getTilePacket function, passing in the tile ID that we have.
