00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.510
So let us now return to our original example of these two stories and

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.119
see how the analysis we have done, this semantic analysis,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.570
can help disambiguate between the two meanings of kill here.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.630
So, first my background knowledge tells me that kill can have several meanings,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.960
just like take had several meanings earlier. Kill can have

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.520
the meaning of causing the death of someone, or kill can have the meaning of,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.010
to put an end to something. There could be other meanings of kill as well.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.560
Second, my background knowledge tells me that when kill has the meaning of,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.260
to cause the death of someone, it typically is a victim as well as an agent.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.320
In this particular case, the victim is 25 people,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.510
the agent is a serious earthquake. My background knowledge also tells me,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.350
that when the meaning to kill is to put an end to something,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.270
then typically it is both an agent that puts an end to something and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.410
an object that gets put an end to. In this particular case,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.460
25 proposals is the object, and the agent is President of Lower Slabovia. It is

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.840
this combination of background knowledge that allows me to infer the meaning of,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.780
kill, in the first sentence as, to cause the death of,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.760
someone. And kill, in the second sentence as,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.330
to put an end to something. I hope you can appreciate the power and

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.900
beauty of this theory. But it is also important to point out that this theory

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.640
has many limitations. To understand some of the limitations of this theory,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.410
let's go back to the sentence, I took the candy from the baby. In this sentence,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.820
we inferred that took signifies stealing the candy from the baby. And in fact,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.740
we had a large number of rules that told us how to make sense of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.130
the word take by making sense of the word candy, making sense of the word from.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.980
But as we look at increasingly large number of forms of the sentence,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.710
the number of rules that we need starts exploding. So consider small variations

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.240
of the sentence. I took the candy for the baby. I took the toy from the baby.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.980
I took the medicine from the baby. I took the smile from the baby.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.140
I took a smile for the baby. They're all valid English language sentences, and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.070
each one of them tells a story. As I look at more and more variations of this

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.810
sentence, I'll need to find more and more rules that can disambiguate between

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.460
different interpretations of cake in those variations of sentence.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.210
In practice it turns out that it's very hard to enumerate all the rules for

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.400
all the variations of sentences like this one. Nevertheless, the story appears

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.660
to cover a good percentage of stories that we routinely deal with.
