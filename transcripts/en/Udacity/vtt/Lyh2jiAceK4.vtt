00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.075
We need to change where the counter variable starts. Because now we want it to

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:07.644
start at 20. We want to stop if the counter is less than zero, so we'll need to

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:12.646
change the direction of the sign. And we want the variable i to go down every

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:18.100
time instead of up, so we replace plus plus with minus minus. Now, for the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.089
finishing touches. And if I run the program, it goes like this. Those days

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.476
counted down a little fast, but that's okay for now. But that's okay. Now you

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:26.820
now how to count down.
