00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you took CS 101, you saw the idea of memoization.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you haven't seen it, the idea is that sometimes particularly with

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the recursive function, you will be making the same function calls over and over again.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If the result of a function call is always the same and the computation took a long time,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
it's better to store the results of each value of N with its result in a cache,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a table data structure, and then look it up each time rather than try to recompute it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We can make this function be cached very simply with a couple extra lines of code.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We ask if the argument is already in the cache, then we just go ahead and return it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Otherwise, we compute it, store it, and then return it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So this part with the dot, dot, dot, is the body of the function.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
All the rest is just the boiler plate that you have to do to implement this idea of a cache.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We've done this once, and that's fine, but I'm worrying about the principle of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Don't Repeat Yourself.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There's probably going to be lots of functions in which I want to store intermediate results

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in a cache, and I don't want to have to repeat this code all of the time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So this is a great idea for a decorator.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We can define a decorator called memo, which will go ahead and do this cache

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
management, and we can apply it to any function.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The great thing about this pattern of using memoization is that it will speed up

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
any function f that you pass to it because doing a table look-up is going to be faster

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
than a computation as long as the computation is nontrivial, is more than just a look-up.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now the hockey player, Wayne Gretzsky, once said that you miss 100% of the shots

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
you don't take.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is kind of the converse.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This is saying you speed up 100% of the computations that you don't make.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So here's the memo decorator.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The guts of it is the same as what I sketched out previously.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If we haven't computed the result already, we compute the result by applying

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the function f to the arguments.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It gives us the result. We cache that result away, then we return it for this time.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's ready for next time.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Next time we come through, we try to look up the arguments in the cache

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to see if they're there.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If they are, we return the result.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And now I've decided to structure this one as a try-except statement

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
rather than an if-then statement.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In Python, you always have 2 choices.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You can first ask for permission to say are the args in the cache,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and if so, return cache or args, or you can use the try-except pattern to ask for

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
forgiveness afterwards to say, I'm first going to try to say, if the args are in the cache,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
go ahead and return it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If I get a keyError, then I have to fill in the cache by doing the computation

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and then returning the result.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The reason I use the try structure here rather than the if structure

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is because I knew I was going to need it anyways for this third case.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Either the args are in the cache, or they aren't, but then there's this third case

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
which says that the args are not even hashable.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
What does that mean?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Start out with a dictionary d being empty,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and then I'm going to have a variable x, and let's say x is a number.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
If I now ask, is x in d? That's going to tell me false. It's not in the dictionary yet.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But now, let's say I have another variable, which is y, which is the list 1, 2, 3,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and now if I ask is y in d?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You'd think that would tell me false,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
but in fact, it doesn't.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Instead, it gives me an error, and what it's going to tell me

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is type error: unhashable type: list. What does that mean?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That means we were trying to look up y in the dictionary,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and a dictionary is a hash table--implemented as a hash table.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In order to do that, we have to compute the hash code for y and then look in that slot

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in the dictionary.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But this error is telling us that there is no hash code for a list.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Why do you think that is?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Are lists unhashable because lists can be arbitrarily long,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
or because lists can hold any type of data as the elements, not just integers,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
or because lists are mutable.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now I recognize this might be a hard problem if you're not up on hash tables.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This might not be a question you can answer.

00:04:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But give it a shot and give me your one best response.
