00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
So the answer is 3.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.074
And so here I'm showing the memory traffic required for the global version.

00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:08.852
Here I'm showing the memory traffic required from the shared version.

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:13.715
I'm showing all the reads you need to do in red and all the writes you need to do in blue.

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:17.328
And if you sum this series, you'll find for reducing n values in shared memory

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:22.406
you'll do n reads and 1 write but for global memory you do 2 n reads and n writes.

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:26.038
So you would expect that it would run faster, which it will, and let's show that now.

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:28.856
So now I'm going to run the shared memory version.

00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.811
And we see that it does in fact run faster.

00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:37.448
Now we're down to 464 microseconds as opposed to 651.

00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:40.689
But it doesn't run 3 times faster. How come?

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:44.115
Well, the detailed reason is that we're not saturating the memory system.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:46.680
And there's numerous advanced techniques you would need to do

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.999
to totally max out the performance of reduce.

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:52.765
We're not doing that today, but if you're really interested in micro-optimization of this kind,

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:55.967
this application is a really great place to start.

00:00:55.967 --> 00:01:00.508
You'll want to look in particular at processing multiple items per thread instead of just 1.

00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:03.422
You'll also want to perform the 1st step of the reduction

00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:06.546
right when you read the items from global memory into shared memory.

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:09.282
And you'll want to take advantage of the fact that warps are synchronous

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:11.995
when you're doing the last steps of the reduction.

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:13.918
But these are all advanced techniques.

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:16.520
We can talk about them on the forums if you all are interested.
