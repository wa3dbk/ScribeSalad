In this course, the videos will all
contain explanations in pseudocode.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.780
But the text will be full of language
specific notes and examples.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.660
I want to briefly go over some of the
basics you should already know before we

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.650
get started with the new material.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.560
If any of these things don't sound
familiar to you, please spend some time

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.810
reading about them or
checking out other Udacity courses.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.869
If you already know everything just
skim through the information and

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.870
move on to the next lesson.
