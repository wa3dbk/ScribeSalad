00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The idea for this protocol comes from Steve Bellovin and Michael Merritt back in 1992.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There have been many, many variations on this protocol,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
many of which are still in use today.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This protocol starts from Diffie-Hellman, which you should remember from Unit 3,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
where each party starts, they have agreed on the generator and some modulus.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The client picks a random XA value, raises g to that power,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
sends the result to the server.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The server picks a random XB value, raises g to that power,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and sends the result to the client.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They can both now compute the same key by raising the value they received

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to the power of their random value.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The problem with Diffie-Hellman for authentication

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is if there's an active attacker,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that attacker can change the values, send something different,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
set up a shared key independently with each party, and act as a middle attacker

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
intercepting all the traffic because the attacker knows the keys on these 2 separate channels.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The idea of encrypted key exchange is to combine this with symmetric encryption

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to allow the client and server to authenticate each other even if there is a middle attacker.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here's how it works.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I assume there's some password that at the beginning of the protocol

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is known to both the client and the server.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Then the way this protocol works,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the message that the client will send to the server

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
instead of just being the message that would be sent in Diffie-Hellman

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is now that message encrypted using the password.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So this is symmetric encryption using p,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the message that would have been the message in the Diffie-Hellman protocol.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And in addition to that, we also need to send the name of the client.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So let's say that's Alice.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When the server receives this, it can decrypt it and knows this password,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and so it obtains the value that would have been sent in the Diffie-Hellman protocol.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That means it can compute a key using its secret value XB,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
combining that with the decrypted result here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
As in the Diffie-Hellman protocol, it also sends a message back to the client.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
In Diffie-Hellman that would just be g to the XB mod q

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
where XB is the secret value selected by the server.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now we're going to combine that with symmetric encryption,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
encrypting that with the password.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Alice decrypts that message, so she can also obtain the value here

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and obtain the key using the normal Diffie-Hellman technique.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So now we'll have a quiz to see if you understand the EKE protocol.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The question is, which of these are drawbacks of using the protocol

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
as we've described it here to authenticate a user--that would be Alice on this side--

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to a website--that would be the server on this side.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The first possibility is that it's vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is where an attacker goes through a dictionary of common passwords

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
trying to guess the password of a user.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The second choice is that it requires servers to store the passwords in clear text.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And as we discussed in Unit 2, this is never a good idea.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The third choice is it's vulnerable to meet in-the-middle attacks

00:02:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
just like the Diffie-Hellman protocol was.
