00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.037
A set of points described by Z equals 0 is a plane going along the X and Y

00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:07.088
directions, through the origin. This is where the camera is located in

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:11.394
projection space. So the third answer is the correct one. The points described

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:15.288
by the last three answers are all located outside the frustum. These points

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:18.610
should be culled, and any edges formed from them clipped to the view volume.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.225
This culling and clipping is done before division by W. Points on or inside the

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:25.040
frustum are guaranteed to have valid W values.
