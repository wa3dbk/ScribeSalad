00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.538
Transpose of a matrix is this original matrix with it's rows and columns flipped

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:09.788
along the diagonal. There are two diagonals but the one I mean is from the upper

00:00:09.788 --> 00:00:13.880
left to the lower right. It's where we put the scale factors for example. Here

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.112
I'm showing the original matrix A,B,C,D and so on with column order. What we do

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:24.818
to transpose is we flip along the diagonal and they're now in this order. The

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:29.932
mathematical notation for this is M superscript T, where T means transpose. The

00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:34.878
other operation that is commonly done to a matrix is computing its inverse. The

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:39.084
inverse is shown like this a negative 1 in the superscript. If you multiply a

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:43.243
matrix by its inverse, you get the identity matrix. The inverse of a matrix

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:47.930
essentially undoes the work of that matrix. For example, if your matrix moves an

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.367
object five units up, the inverse moves it five units down. The inverse of a

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:56.369
rotation matrix is one that rotates on the same axis but back the other

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.942
direction. The inverse of a scale matrix scales the object back down. Let's look

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:04.988
at the inverses of some common transform matrices. For translation, we start

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:09.613
with our translation values over here. The inverse is the negation of all those

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:14.168
translation values. Which makes sense. You move to one direction, and then you

00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:18.456
come back the other direction. For any rotation matrix, it turns out that the

00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:24.300
inverse is the transpose. So, for this one, for example. Its rotation around the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.316
z axis and you simply transpose these two elements and you know have the inverse

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:34.289
of the z rotation. For a scale matrix, we divide one by the original scale

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.824
factors. Or to say it more mathematically. We take the multiplicative inverse of

00:01:38.824 --> 00:01:43.126
each scale factor. Things get more complex when we combine rotation, translation

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:47.094
and scale matrices. The inverse of a matrix representing a complex series of

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:51.076
transforms is usually not obvious. I won't spend the time explaining how to

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:54.992
compute an inverse that's a whole lesson of linear algebra. The good news is

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:59.380
that every graphics library in the know universe. Has a matrix inversion routine

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.204
of some sort. Three.js is no exception. Matrix4 class has a getInverse function.
