00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.518
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This time we have to worry about both variables and coefficients. If we look

00:00:04.518 --> 00:00:08.910
at the coefficient in each terms, they have a common factor of 6, so we know

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.374
that we have to pull that out of our expression, but there's also an x in both

00:00:13.374 --> 00:00:18.029
12xy and in 18x squared. So that is a fact that needs to comes out as well. So

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.351
the full common factor that 12xy and 18x squared share is 6x. I mean, you divide

00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:27.396
each term by that, you get 2y and 3x.
