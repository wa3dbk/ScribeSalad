00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.817
The greatest common factor for 15, 20 and -35 is just 5. That's going to start

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:09.645
the product for my GCF. Now I want to lowest factor for f that is common between

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:14.589
all the terms. Well, just 1 x is common between all the terms. The lowest power

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.364
of Y that is common is 2. So y squared would also appear in my GCF. An finally,

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:23.696
I look at the lowest power of Z between all of the terms, but I have to be

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:28.716
careful. There's no z over here. So z won't be included in my GCF. So a factor

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:33.487
of 5x y squared from each of these terms. I need 3x y squared z cubed for the

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:38.505
first term. 4z to the fifth of the second term and negative x squared y for the

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:43.444
last term. I can do this pretty quickly if just check the multiplication as I

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:48.342
go. 5 times 3 is 15. X times x is x squared, and y squared times y squared is y

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:53.050
to the 4th. Of course, I also have this z cubed on the end. So this is my first

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.589
term. When I multiply these two terms together, I get 20xy squared z to the

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.443
fifth. The variables are just listed are multiplied together. And 5 times 4 is

00:01:02.443 --> 00:01:07.484
20. Finally, I know this last term must be correct. 5 times negative 7 is

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:12.692
negative 35, and x times x squared is x cubed. The last variable is y cubed,

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:17.957
which comes from y squared times y. So yeah, this is definitely my factored

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:18.387
form.
