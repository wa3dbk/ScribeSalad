00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.328
After one month I would have $250. Well, this is below our line so that means we

00:00:05.328 --> 00:00:10.677
saved less than $100 in a month. We started with $200 and we only gained $50. We

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:15.472
should have gained more than a $100. For 2 months and $500, we can see that,

00:00:15.472 --> 00:00:20.074
that is above our line. This means we must have saved more than $100 in one of

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:24.499
these months. I know this because after 2 months, I should expect to have

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.221
exactly $400 if I were to have saved exactly $100 a month. But we have more. So

00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:34.352
this one works. This one's a little bit tricky. After 1 month, I saved exactly

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:39.556
300 dollars. Well, this means I saved exactly 100 dollars in that 1 month. So I

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:44.664
didn't save more than 100 dollars. So this one's out. This point means that,

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:48.664
after 3 months, I saved 400 dollars. That would put me here.
