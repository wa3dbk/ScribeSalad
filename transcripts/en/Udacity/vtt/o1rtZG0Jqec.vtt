00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.083
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that we know what parabolas look like, it's time to talk about how to

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:08.504
actually draw them. I mean, what you do with your hand to make them appear.

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:13.032
First things first, let's pick an equation to experiment with graphing with. I

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:17.225
want to use y equals x squared minus 2x minus 3. Just like with linear

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:21.237
equations, for quadratics we can use x y tables to come up with a bunch of

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:25.770
points that should lie on any given line or curve. In fact for quadratics, since

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.995
we're graphing these fancy curve parabolas, I find it's much easier for me if I

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:34.156
write down a bunch of points. When you're drawing a line, you really only need

00:00:34.156 --> 00:00:38.462
to mark two points and then connect them together. So I'm going to use these

00:00:38.462 --> 00:00:42.781
points to graph this curve right now. I'll of course label my axes. Here I'm

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:47.077
just going to use a scale of 1 for each grid mark. Wonderful. Now that I have

00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:51.365
all of these points marked, I can start sketching a line that looks like it'll

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:55.798
connect all of them. I like to start at the vertex, at this lowest point in this

00:00:55.798 --> 00:00:59.616
case, and then moved in a curved way up to the next point to the left.

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:03.780
Definitely takes practice to get your hand to move smoothly like you want it to,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.657
but there, that's not too bad. Moving to the right is usually a little bit

00:01:07.657 --> 00:01:11.552
harder for me. Takes a bit more sketching. So you can see I am doing little

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:15.584
strokes to make sure I'm moving my pen in the direction I really want the line

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:20.222
to go. Now it's a half a sort of rough sketch. I can go over it to make it

00:01:20.222 --> 00:01:23.735
smoother. And voila, we have a parabola.
