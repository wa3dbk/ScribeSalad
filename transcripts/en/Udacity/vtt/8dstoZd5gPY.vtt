00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.330
Let's look at the solution to our
not most recently used replacement

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.010
policy quiz.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.760
We have these axises, and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.830
now let's see which ones might be
hits and which ones might be misses.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.010
This one is definitely a miss because
we have nothing in the cache.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.640
And now we have brought
A into the cache.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.900
This one is definitely a hit.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.450
No we're going to access B,
and this is definitely a miss.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.270
And we're going to put B in a separate
place in the cache from where

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.860
we put A because A is
the most recently used block.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.980
So we will put B in one of
the other three blocks.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.680
And we definitely will put B in
a line that doesn't contain A.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.740
So we will not take out A because
A's the most recently used block.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.270
We will choose one of the other
three lines to evict to put B there.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.940
So far, if this is our cache,
we have A and B there.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.630
Now we will access A and have a hit,
so C is definitely a miss, and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.010
at that point A is the most
recently used block.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.520
And we will find one of these
three to evict to put C there.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.210
In this type of a situation it looks
like B might actually be evicted.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.860
But remember that we also have
value bits for all these blocks.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.480
So when we have a placement policy,
typically we will first fill

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.190
all the lines in the cache set before we
move on and start evicting something.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.820
So we will put C into one
of the empty slots, and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.440
now that is the most
recently accessed line.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.630
A is now a hit, and that is now
the most recently accessed line.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.369
Now when we access D, it's not in
the cache, so we will have a miss.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.770
We will again put D in
an unused place and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.310
that will now be the most
recently used one.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.940
Then A gets accessed and
we have a hit, and

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.410
at this point A's the most
recently used block.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.505
Now, we will have a miss on E
because it's not in the cache.

00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:03.930
And now the question is,
what will be evicted?

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.550
We'll definitely not evict A, so

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.170
we know that the next four
accesses to A will be all hits.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.830
E will be replacing one
of these three blocks.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.000
So if we replace C or D,
then here we will have a hit.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.910
If we, however, select B for
replacement, and

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.080
put E there,
then B here will have a miss.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.290
So we have a hit or a miss here.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.430
In total, we have one, two,
three, four, five, or six misses.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.930
So this is the final
answer to this quiz.
