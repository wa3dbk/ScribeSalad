00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.346
Let's flip this around, keeping the light fixed and showing the effect on the

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:08.470
sphere. In fact, throughout this unit, let's assume each light is extremely far

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.854
away like the sun. So, we can just look at its direction instead of its

00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:15.578
position. That way, we don't have to think about the light's direction changing

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:19.658
as the surface changes position. Here, the sphere's normal changes with respect

00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:23.812
to the light. The light's effect is at a maximum at the top of the sphere, goes

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:27.838
to 0 at the equator, and stays that way since the bottom of the sphere faces

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:31.333
away from the light. This is what the diffused term looks like when the sphere

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.342
it is lit from above. This next point is a little subtle but I think it's worth

00:00:34.342 --> 00:00:38.603
going through. A diffused material is defined as one that scatters light in all

00:00:38.603 --> 00:00:42.885
directions above the plane according to this cosine law. So, this green shows

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:47.807
how the amount of light gathered actually drops off as the angle gets steeper.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:51.852
That is, the amount of light from a single point on a surface drops off with the

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:55.764
cosine of the angle, the surface compared to the eye. So, you might think less

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.936
light would hit the eye when the surface is viewed from a shallow angle.

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:02.652
However, a balancing factor is that, as the angle of the surface to the viewer

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:06.422
increases, the area of the surface visible through the pixel proportionally

00:01:06.422 --> 00:01:10.435
increases. That is, you see more of the surface even though less light per unit

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:14.622
area is reflected towards the eye. These offsetting effects give the net result

00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:18.796
we want. The viewers location doesn't matter at all. As the shade of the surface

00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:23.390
depends only on the angle to the light itself. Not needing the eye direction

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.172
makes the diffuse term faster to compute, which is always important at an

00:01:27.172 --> 00:01:28.523
interactive rendering.
