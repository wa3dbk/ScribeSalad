What do we know about our line at this point? I'm not really interested in

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:07.825
things that we can figure out. There are a lot of things that we can figure out.

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:11.818
But just things that we know explicitly right now. Do we know its y intercept,

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:15.795
its x intercept? Its slope? Or 1 point that lies on it? You can pick as many of

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:17.873
these answers as you think are correct.
