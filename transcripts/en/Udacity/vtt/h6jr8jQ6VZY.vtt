00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here is my solution. I think it is a little bit simpler.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The total number of lines of code is not that much different,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but I think it's easier to follow this way.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What I said is let's pick out the light from the state,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and let's take all the travelers a and b from within the state indexed by that light

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with 0 being here and 1 being there.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's find the individual successor states that results from those two travelers,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or they might be one and the same--a and b traveling from that state.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I broke out this single successor function.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That just says we start where the light is, and we go to where the light isn't.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If the light was on side 0, then we go from the start to the destination,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and the light now is on side 1, and we're going in that direction.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Otherwise, we're going in the other direction.
