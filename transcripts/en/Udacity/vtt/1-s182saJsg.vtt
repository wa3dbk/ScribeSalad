00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.425
Hey Chris.

00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:02.060
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.562
&gt;&gt; I got those burgers we
ordered from the restaurant.

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:04.874
&gt;&gt; Awesome, they look great.

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:06.187
&gt;&gt; Looks awesome.

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:07.896
&gt;&gt; I'm going to dig in here.

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:10.561
Wait a second, this doesn't
look like a Hawaiian burger.

00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:12.497
Where's my runny egg?

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:15.008
&gt;&gt; Yeah and they kind of got
the wrong bun on mine, didn't they?

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:16.900
&gt;&gt; Dude, but did you tell them
what kind of burgers we ordered?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.612
No, I just called and said,
I'd like two burgers to go, please.

00:00:21.612 --> 00:00:23.546
And they said it'd be
ready in 15 minutes.

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:24.466
&gt;&gt; Dude, really?

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.286
You gotta be more specific.

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:26.467
&gt;&gt; I figured they'd just know.

00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:28.950
We get the same thing every time.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.845
Maybe I should've told them
who I was when I was ordering.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:33.842
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you think?

00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:38.785
Making an HTTP request is like
ordering a burger at a restaurant.

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:42.037
If you don't specifically order the
cheeseburger medium rare with a fried

00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:44.576
egg, you might get a turkey
burger on sourdough instead.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:49.141
&gt;&gt; Yeah, HTTP requests likewise
specify explicitly what content you're

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:52.710
looking for and
how you'd like it delivered.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.835
&gt;&gt; In this next lesson, we'll talk
about how HTTP requests are used to get

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:59.333
the information that
we need over the web.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.730
&gt;&gt; HTTP requests are a basic part of
how devices get information from other

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.530
computers on the Internet.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.050
The idea is you ask for some
information, you get a response, and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.060
then you extract the information
in a way that's useful.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.653
Every time you visit a page like
Google.com on your computer

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:19.747
the web browser sends an HTP request
to the address that you entered.

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:23.053
It gets received by the computers
on the Internet that Google owns,

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:26.770
which process the request and create
a response to send back to your device.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.470
Then the browser on your device
interprets the response and

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.144
updates the screen, which is the Google
home page that you probably recognize.

00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:37.204
Now check this out, I'm going to give
you a little sneak peak into some neat

00:01:37.204 --> 00:01:39.685
developer tools in
the Chrome web browser.

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:41.890
Feel free to try this out on your own.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.841
To access Chrome's developer tools,
I'm going to activate contacts menu.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:52.239
That's a right-click usually,
chose Inspect.

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.377
Now you can see Chrome developer tools
has a lot of information about each page

00:01:55.377 --> 00:01:56.251
and how it's drawn.

00:01:56.251 --> 00:02:00.630
It's got HTML CSS and
this stuff here, the Elements tab.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.512
What we want is the Network tab,

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:06.433
the Network tab is going to show us
what loaded to create the webpage.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.110
There is a lot of
different resources and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.419
we'll see HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and images and

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:16.936
that sort of thing all getting loaded
into the page at the same time.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.642
So let me do a refresh on this page, and

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:23.290
you can see all this files
just loaded themselves.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.209
You can even see the timeline here of
how long it took for each one to load.

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.029
If I scroll up you can see here's
the main google.com resource that we got

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:37.336
with use to get method, to retrieve the
page and the status response was 200.

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:42.526
And it even tells us the size and
how long it took to retrieve the page.

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:46.926
And if I resize this window a bit so
I can see the content down here,

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:51.886
I can even see the request headers that
made up the request that came from my

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:55.390
device and
was sent to the Google servers.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.239
Now the same communication and transfer
happens when you request data on

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.900
a mobile device whether it's the web
browser app viewing a website or

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.370
any other app using an API.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.032
Apps can fetch data from some
remote source across the Internet,

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:11.669
such as computers owned by the USGS.

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.123
Let's explore HTTP in
a little more detail.

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:18.542
When we make an HTTP request,
we're basically including very specific

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:22.960
directions on what information we want
from another computer on a network.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.604
In the request we include
a uniform resource olcator or

00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:31.128
URL which is the address or location
of the data source that we want.

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:35.265
The URL tells us that we need to
communicate with computers at USGS as

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:39.122
opposed to the computers at Google or
any other organization.

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:41.750
A URL should look
pretty familiar to you.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.890
It's a string of characters you type
into your web browser whenever you want

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.470
to visit a web page like google.com or
udacity.com.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.860
Let's take a look at this example URL.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.280
The first part is called the protocol or
scheme.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.030
This is usually going to be http or
https.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.199
The next part is called the host,
domain, or authority.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.152
These all pretty much mean the same
thing, the main identity of the web

00:04:05.152 --> 00:04:09.060
resource you're connecting to
like udacity.com or google.com.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.270
The next part is the resource path.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.980
This is analogous to a file or
folder structure on your computer, or

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.940
some other hierarchical
organization of information.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.570
The final part is called the query.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.576
The begin of the query is
indicated by the question mark.

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:28.935
The query is an optional way to include
information about things you're looking

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.830
for like search terms or
categories of information.
