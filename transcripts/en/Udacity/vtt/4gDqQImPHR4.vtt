00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.510
The third type of cryptographic
algorithms is hash functions.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.170
Hash functions don't use keys.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.000
A hash function computes the hash, or
the message digest of data of any size.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.500
The hash or the message digest is
a fixed length output, typically,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.700
in the range of 128 to 512 bits.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.700
Hash functions are ,typically,
useful authentication and

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.490
protection of message authenticity and
integrity.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.370
In order to provide these services,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.580
hash functions must satisfy
these following properties.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.880
First, it should be relatively easy to
compute a hash of a given message m.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.200
This would make hardware and
software implementations practical.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.180
In other words, we want to be able
to compute hash very efficiently.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.830
Second, for given hash value,
it should be completely infeasible to

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.970
find the original message m, such that,
the hash of m is this given hash value.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.630
This so called one way
property is very important.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.970
For example, suppose Alice wants
to authenticate herself to Bob.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.330
Alice would hash a secret,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.740
that she shares with Bob,
as with the current timestamp together.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.980
For example,
she can concatenate the secret s,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.170
with the current timestamp together,
and then,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.500
hash over the concatenated value,
and send the hash value over to Bob.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.910
Bob would know that, this must be Alice,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.950
because he can check the current time
stamp, and he has the share secret S.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.660
In other words,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.310
Bob can take the current time stamp
concatenate with the shared secret s,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.980
and compute his own hash, and compare
with the hash value with the received

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.680
hash value, if they match, then he knows
that he's been communicating with Alice.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.060
Now, because the hash value is
transmitted over the Internet, and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.570
we must assume that an attacker

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.510
can obtain any value that's
transmitted over the Internet.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.090
That is, the attacker may be
able to obtain this hash value.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.979
If the hash function is not one way,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.450
that means the attacker can
reverse the hash function, and

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.160
find out the input to the hash function,
which includes the share secret s.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.760
If the attacker knows
the share secret s,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.260
then the attacker can impersonate
Alice to Bob, or Bob to Alice.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.370
So this is, an example,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.490
that demonstrates that the one way
property of hash function is essential.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.130
Another property of hash function
is that given a message m1,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.000
it should be computationally infeasible
to find a different message m2,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.070
such that they have
the exact same hash value.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.370
This is the weak collision
resistant property.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.150
This is an essential property for
message authenticity and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.860
integrity protection.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.960
Imagine the following situation.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.950
Alice wants to send a message,
m, to Bob.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.860
And she wants to make
sure that Bob knows that

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.540
Alice is the real author of m.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.180
So Alice is going to send m,
along with a sign hash of m,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.970
meaning that Alice would hash m and
then, sign hash, using her private key.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.550
Now an attacker can look at
the traffic on the Internet, and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.430
find that Alice is sending m,
and assign hash to Bob.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.610
If the weak collision resistant
property is not there,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.090
then the attacker may be able to
find a different message m pi,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.560
such that the hash of m pi would
be the same as the hash of m,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.121
therefore, although the attacker has
changed the message from m to m pi,

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:43.540
the signature will still match.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.400
And therefore, when Bob receives m pi,
and the original signature of hash of m,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.870
Bob will not know that the message
has been changed from m to m pi.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.420
This is a simple example to show that
the weak collision of system property

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.225
is essential to protect message
authenticity and integrity.

00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:07.590
There's a stronger version of
the collision resistant property.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.330
It says that it should be
computationally infeasible to find

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.420
different messages, m1 and m2, such that
they have exactly the same hash value.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.230
This is a stronger property
because it prevents the attacker

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.530
from coming up with two different
messages, that have the same hash value.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.370
Again, this property is essential for

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.960
protecting message authenticity and
integrity.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.930
For example, suppose Bob can write a IOU
message, and send it to Alice to sign.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.370
Again, the way that Alice will sign it
is to hash the message first, and then,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.090
sign the hash, using a private key.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.170
If Bob can find two different messages,
that have the same hash value,

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.890
one of which requires Alice
to pay a small amount, and

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.160
the other requires her to
pay a very large amount.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.660
And the two different messages
have exactly the same hash.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.960
Suppose Bob sends the message with
a small amount for Alice to sign.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.270
After Bob receives Alice's signature
on the message with the small amount,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.790
Bob can then go around and claim
that Alice owes her a larger amount,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.490
because the two different messages,
have the same hash.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.870
And the signatures
would then be the same.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.980
It should be obvious
that if a hash function

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.110
satisfies the strong
collision resistant property,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.380
it automatically satisfies the weak
collision system property.
