00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.343
I have compiled in this little chart over here, some of the equations for which

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:08.599
we've already said that we could calculate the slope or rather just read the

00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:12.992
slope off of the equation by looking at the coefficient of the x term. And I've

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:17.186
also included two equations in which we said that, that was something we could

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.876
do. My question is, what is unique about these questions on the left that allows

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:26.524
us to just read the slope off of their x term coefficient? Can we do this

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:31.485
because of the form of the equation because there are two or fewer terms on the

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:36.637
right side of each of these equations? Because there's nothing added to y on the

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.216
left side? Or because they have a y and an x?
