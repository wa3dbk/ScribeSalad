00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.672
Some point must have a y value of 0 along this line. 0 is the number that

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:09.870
separates the negative numbers from the positive numbers. And since we know

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.445
that y is negative at A, but positive at B, it has to be 0 somewhere in

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:15.387
between.
