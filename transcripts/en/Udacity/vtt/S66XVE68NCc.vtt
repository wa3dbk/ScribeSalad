00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.724
One last thing about password hashing. You know, all of this

00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:06.960
is, is, is, is good to understand. And most modern computers

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.212
hash passwords in just the same way I showed you. Generally

00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:14.780
we, you can use SHA-256 that works okay. The problem with most

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.770
hashing functions, is that they're designed to be fast. So generally

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.040
this is a good thing. You know, if, if you're going to be

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.360
using this hashing function, you know, to be verifying your cookies

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.450
and what not. Yeah, you want it to be fast, you want to

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.080
slow down your web server verifying, you know, cookie data all

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.020
the time. But for cases like passwords, when it's much more likely

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.300
that somebodies going to be trying to brute force you. It would be

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.410
really cool if we had a hashing function that has both really

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.650
good, like SHA-256, but also kind of slow. So that computers get

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.360
faster and faster, the hash function stays the same speed. And, I'm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.170
about to tell you about such a function, it's called bcrypt. The

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.810
reason I didn't use it in my last example, is because it's

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.990
not built into Python. So it's not super convenient for me

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.700
to demonstrate. And I, and I don't want to have, you know,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.880
expect you to install it. But you know in the future

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.010
outside this course, instead of SHA-56, use bcrypt instead. And your life

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950
will be better. And what bcrypt, bcrypt is cool, it basically

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.850
takes an extra parameter, which is. How long do you want this

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.790
to take? and, and it's neat, so now you have this

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.510
function that will stay slow forever. Because you can make it slow.
