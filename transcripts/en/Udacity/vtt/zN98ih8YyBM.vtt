00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The correct answer is f because it violates the precondition of g.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Pre- and post conditions are generally considered specifications--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that is they have the authority to say what is right and what is wrong,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and if you violate a precondition, this means that the caller is wrong.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
G raises an exception well and that's just the messenger. We don't shoot messenger.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And f and g, well, obviously are incompatible--yes, that's right,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but since pre- and post conditions serve as specifications are definitely f is at fault

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for violating this specification and g is fine--it just raise the exception.
