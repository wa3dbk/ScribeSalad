00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.340
Now that we have a better understanding, of, the benefits of separating the

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.280
data and control plane, let's now have a look, at the many different options for

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.260
SDN controllers. There are a number of different SDN controllers that

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.534
exist, including NOX, Ryu, Floodlight, Pyretic,

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:26.520
Frenetic, Procera, Route Flow, Trema, and the list goes on.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.590
In this lesson, we will explore the merits of these three

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.950
controllers. And when we get to the lesson on Programming SDN,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.010
we will take a close look at Frenetic and Pyretic. Let's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.380
now jump in and take a look at these three controllers.
