00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.710
The answer is the last two only.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.270
For the roommate problem,
we make a vertex for each individual.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.660
And we add an edge between two vertices
if the two individuals are compatible.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.880
We find a max matching and
matched edges become roommates.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.890
This is a great application
of maximum matching.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.230
But, more likely than not there will
be an odd cycle of compatibility,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.810
meaning that the graph is not bipartite.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.970
This changes the nature of
the problem significantly.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.650
The taxi problem on the other
hand is clearly bipartite.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.630
We model the taxis with
one set of vertices and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.460
the customers with the others.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.450
And we want to find
the minimum total pick up time.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.480
We can imagine having edges between
the taxis and customers finding and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.360
matching here, and
adding up all of these times.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.780
The problem here is
the existence of the costs,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.870
which demand a different solution
from just finding a maximum matching.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.730
Assigning professors to classes
is a bipartite matching problem.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.120
One side of the partition
is the professors, and

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.489
the other is the classes, and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.940
we include an edge if the professor
is qualified to teach class.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.700
A maximum matching solution then will
allow us to teach as many classes

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.800
as possible.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.920
Hopefully, this will be all of them.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.510
The situation with organ donors and
patients is analogous.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510
We add an edge if the patient
will accept the organ, and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.100
we match as many organs
to the patient as we can.
