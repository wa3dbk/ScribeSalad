00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.730
The grammar of graphics is a formalism surrounding the principles of

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.850
creating visualizations.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.540
Leland Wilkinson invented the theory in his seminal book,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.916
the Grammar of Graphics in 1999.

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:15.500
To make reasoning and thinking about graphics and charts easier.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.696
You might be asking yourself, what exactly do you mean,

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:22.434
when you say the grammar of of graphics is a visualization theory?

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:26.834
I thought visualizations had to be physical, with lines,

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:31.059
circles, axis, and represents some underlying data.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.519
Well, Leland Wilkinson invented this theory in his seminal book titled by

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.320
the same name to make reasoning and thinking about graphics easier.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.700
Think of it as defining a set of best practices for

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.180
developing and iterating on a data visualization.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.170
At its most fundamental level,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.240
the grammar of graphics makes a distinction to separate content from aesthetic.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.450
Or in our case our data from our visual presentation of it.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Now this may not seem like a groundbreaking theory but before the grammar of

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.970
graphics researchers, artists, and developers often coupled the information they

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.870
were trying to communicate very tightly with their medium of communication.
