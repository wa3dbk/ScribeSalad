00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.500
Instead of using the device's exact
pixel density which can vary quite

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.740
a bit like 311 dpi or

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.360
442 dpi, Android groups devices
into a number of density buckets.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.164
Each device gets assigned a density
bucket that most closely matches

00:00:17.164 --> 00:00:19.430
its actual pixel density.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.010
So a device with a 311 dpi screen
might get assigned 320 dpi or XHDPI,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.807
and a device with a 442 dpi screen
might get assigned XXHDPI or 480 dpi.

00:00:32.807 --> 00:00:37.325
Though there are density buckets for
both incredibly low density screens,

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:42.338
like 120 dpi, and really high density
screens, like 640 dpi, you generally

00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:48.004
only have to work with the middle four
shown here, 160, 240, 320, and 480 dpi.

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:52.670
And these are sometimes
referred to as 1X, 2X, and 3X.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.505
Now, these buckets give you control
over the scaling of your graphic assets,

00:00:57.505 --> 00:00:59.150
things like icons.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.450
They also ensure that you don't have to
create hundreds of different versions

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.150
of these little icons for
each screen's exact pixel density.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.295
They essentially make your UI elements
almost exactly the same physical size,

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:15.530
like really, really close while
letting you only produce assets for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.081
a handful of densities, these four.
