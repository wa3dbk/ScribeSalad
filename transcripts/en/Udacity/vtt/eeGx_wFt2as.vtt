00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.196
As before, we pull out a common factor from each pair of terms, and that gets us

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:10.350
to a point where we have x plus 4 times x squared minus 1. Now, it's really easy

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.506
to think that this is the final factored form, but we are not done right now. We

00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:20.875
have to recognize that the term x squared minus 1 is just a difference of

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:26.041
squares. We know that if we have a squared minus b squared, that can be factored

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:30.616
as a plus b times a minus b. We can do the same thing for this expression, x

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:35.410
squared minus 1 is equal to x plus 1 times x minus 1. This orange expression is

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.135
our final factored form. This rule is definitely a really tricky problem, so

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:40.803
great job.
