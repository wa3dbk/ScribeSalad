00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.690
So now, let me ask you a second question. We just saw that we

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.640
can, reveal a failure in the program

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.640
by calling double with parameter three. Where

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.750
is the fault that causes such failure in the program? So I want you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.900
to write the number of the line of code that, that contains the fault.
