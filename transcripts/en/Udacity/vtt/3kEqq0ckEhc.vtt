00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Dave] Now we have our get_next_target procedure,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and we know how to use it by using multiple assignment

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to get the 2 results.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There's 1 serious problem with the get_next_target procedure that we have to fix

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
before we go on to the problem of outputting all of the links in the page.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The problem is we didn't really think very carefully about what should happen

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
if the input does not have another link.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's try and see what actually happens the way we've defined it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here's the code we have for get_next_target, and we're going to try an example.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
First we'll try an example where there is a link,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so what we should get as the next target when this is the page

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that's passed in is the link that's included,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which is between the double quotes inside the a href tag.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
When we run that, we get our 2 outputs.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We got the string that's the link,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and we got 37, which is the position of the end quote.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And we can see it's printing out the 2 outputs as a tuple,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
meaning the first one, the second one

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
surrounded by parentheses, and we could get those in an assignment like this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Instead of just printing it, we'll use our double assignment,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
getting those outputs, and we'll print the value of just the URL.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And we get the string http://udacity.com.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That worked well.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now what happens if instead of passing in a page

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that actually has a link, we pass in something that doesn't.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Let's say our page is just the text "good."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, there's no link to find,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but the code is going to run anyway, and what we see as the result

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is we actually got the result "goo."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Probably not what we wanted,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and the reason we got the result "goo" is you remember the find command,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
if it does not find what it's looking for, it returns -1.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And when we use -1 as an index, that means the last character of the string.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So what we end up with is getting all the characters except for the last character.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If we pass in something else that does have a double quote in it,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
so now we'll pass in 'Not "good" at all!'

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we see what we get back for the URL is Not.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
This is not very useful.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This is pretty confusing behavior.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's going to be very hard to tell when we've gotten to the last target

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
because maybe Not could be a valid URL, and we don't know that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What we want to do is make get_next_target return something more useful

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in the case where the input does not contain any link,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and the way we're going to do that we'll leave partly up to you.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But I'll give you a hint to get started.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We're going to want to change the code,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and you're going to want to put something into the code here.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If we found a link, well, we've got a value for start_link

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that's the position of the start link.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If we didn't find a link, what we got back from find was -1,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and I want you to change what the get_next_target procedure does,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
so when there's no link to find,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
what we should return is the value None.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
This is the special value that means there isn't anything.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And we'll return 0 as the endpos.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Let me write that out more precisely, but the hint is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
you're going to have to change the code

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
after you've found the start_link to figure out

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
whether there is a link to find.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Your goal for this quiz is to modify the get_next_target procedure

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that we've defined so that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
if there is a link, it behaves exactly as it does now,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
still returns the URL of the link target,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
as well as the number of that position where the end quote is.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But if there's no link in the input string,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
it should output None as the first output

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and 0 as the second output, and None is a special value

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that means it's not actually returning anything.
