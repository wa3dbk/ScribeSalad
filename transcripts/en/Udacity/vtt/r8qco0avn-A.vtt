00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.478
Here we want to know the extent to which proximity can influence attraction,

00:00:04.478 --> 00:00:09.192
that is how close someone is to us. It turns out that when selecting a

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:13.027
potential mate, we see that where someone lives can play a significant role in

00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:19.263
who we select simply due to their proximity. Meaning that if you grow up in the

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:22.497
Midwest in the United States, this likely rules out the possibility of falling

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:27.603
in love with someone who lives in Paris. That is, unless you travel to Paris on

00:00:27.603 --> 00:00:32.610
vacation, and meet the love a your life. Therefore, proximity to other

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.960
individuals provides us the opportunity for attraction. It may not come as a

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.282
surprise to you, but physical features can play a large role in attraction. For

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:47.230
example, men who are attracted to women tend to prefer the hourglass figure.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.100
And some people believe that this figure is associated with fertility. On the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.628
other hand, women who are attracted to men tend to prefer the tapering V body

00:00:55.628 --> 00:01:00.666
figure. Some field studies have found that women's weight and men's height are

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:06.238
the best predictors to how many responses they'll get to a personal ad. Another

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:09.802
study that looked at online dating choices of men and women found that physical

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:14.547
attractiveness was the only predictor of dating choice. And as it turns out,

00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:18.752
appearance, doesn't always always play a role in who we're attracted to. It

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:21.270
plays a role in many different contexts.
