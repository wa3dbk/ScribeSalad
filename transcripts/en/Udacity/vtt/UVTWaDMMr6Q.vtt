00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.050
So we have a working application now,
but

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.720
we should probably add some style to it,
if we want it to be appealing to users.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.100
Flask can automatically look for

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.890
CSS, JavaScript, and media files,
if we put them in a folder named static.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.780
So I will create a folder called static,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.610
in the same directory as
my project.py file, as so.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.910
I will create a CSS file, and

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.360
name it styles.css, and
store it inside of this directory.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.660
By adding this following
link to my template files,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.390
I will tell Flask to use this styles.css
file when it renders this template.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.860
When I refresh my browser,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.500
I turn my old unstyled menu page
into one that looks like this.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.950
Take some time to add some
styles to your menu app.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.270
My CSS file and templates can be found
in the instructor notes for reference.
