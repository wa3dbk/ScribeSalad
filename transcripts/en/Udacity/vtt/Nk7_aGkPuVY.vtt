00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570
And the solution to that is 32 because we have 5 communication centers,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.220
and for each communication center we have to construct a separate solution--

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.870
one where the communication center does receive a monitoring device,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.640
and one where it doesn't.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.700
So we have 2 possibilities for the first one, then 2 for the second one, and so on.

00:00:18.700 --> 99:59:59.000
And this is 2^5 which is 32.
