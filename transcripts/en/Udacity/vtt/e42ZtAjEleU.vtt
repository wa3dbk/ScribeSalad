00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.030
Looking back at our code, here is how we would expect that to play out.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.620
We might build amy and ben such that they delegated to Car.methods rather than

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.490
copying all of the Car.methods properties onto amy and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.860
ben here when they're stored in the obj variable.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.465
That way when we go looking for

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:21.760
amy.move, even though the amy object doesn't have its own .move property, we'll

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.910
delegate that lookup to the Car.methods object which does have a move property.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.650
Let's see how that looks in practice.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.210
The problem here is we're using an object literal, these two curly braces, in

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.770
order to build the brand new object, that's going to be an instance of car and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.240
whatever you use in object literal to create an object,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.900
you don't get to define what the prototype of that new object is going to be.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.980
So we're going to have to switch it up and use our other technique for

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.200
creating objects, which is object.create that technique does allow us to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.480
set the prototype of the new object.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.210
Now whatever we put in here, in between these parenthesis,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.880
is going to be the thing that our new object delegates to.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.120
So what object do you expect we're going to need to pass to object.create in

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.470
order to set up the right delegation relationship for every new instance of car.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.500
Note we aren't done refactoring the rest of the code yet, but

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740
before I move on I do want to get this line right.
