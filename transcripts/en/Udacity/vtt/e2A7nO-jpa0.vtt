00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.210
In order to solve for x, we'll subtract 6 x from both sides. Then we'll add 96

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.416
to both sides, and finally we'll divide by 2 to get x alone. So one x is equal

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:16.320
to 84. Great solving if you found 84 miles per hour for the speed of the boat.
