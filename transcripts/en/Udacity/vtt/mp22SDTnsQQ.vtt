00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.600
The next model that we will discuss is the spiral

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.630
model, which was first described by Barry Boehm, which is

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.010
the professor that we interviewed at the beginning of this

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.240
lesson. In his paper from 1986 that was entitled A Spiral

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.730
Model of Software Development and Enhancement. And one of the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.520
main characteristics of that paper is that it was describing the

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.670
spiral model using a diagram, which is the one that

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.130
I'm showing you here, and this diagram has become very very

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.950
popular, and you probably saw it either in this

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.400
form or one of the many variations of the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.680
diagram. So I'm not going to discuss all of

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.770
the details of the spiral model, but I just want to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.510
give you an idea of its main characteristics. The

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.580
spiral model is an incremental risk-oriented lifecycle model that has

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.330
four main phases listed here: determine objectives, identify and

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.180
resolve risks, development and tests, and plan the next iteration.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.690
A software project will go through these four phases in

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.020
an iterative way. In the first phase, the requirements will

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.470
be gathered. In the second phase, the risks and the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.010
alternate solutions will be identified, and a prototype will be produced.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.190
Software and tests for the software are produced in the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.210
development and test phase, which is the third step of the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.830
process. Finally, in the fourth phase, the output of the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.880
project, so far, is evaluated, and the next iteration is planned.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.960
So basically, what the spiral process prescribes is a

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.262
way of developing software by going through these phases in

00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:26.020
an iterative way, in which we learn more and more

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.420
of the software, we identify more and more, and account

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.250
for, more and more risks and we go more

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.000
and more towards our final solution, our final release. There

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.930
are several advantages of using a spiral model. The first

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.930
one is that the extensive risk analysis does reduce the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.140
chances of the project to fail. So there is a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.300
risk reduction advantage. The second advantage is that functionality can be

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.190
added at a later phase because of the iterative nature of

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.175
the process. And finally, software is produced early in the software

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:58.260
lifecycle. So, at any iteration, we have something to show

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.300
for our development. We don't wait until the end before producing

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.790
something. And then of course there's also the advantage that we

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.190
can get early feedback from the customer about what we produced.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.000
The main disadvantages on the other hand of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.870
the spiral model, are that the risk analysis requires

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.560
a highly specific expertise. And unfortunately, the whole success

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.260
of the process is highly dependent on risk analysis.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.580
So risk analysis has to be done right.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.510
And finally the spiral model is way more complex

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.180
than other models, like for example, the water fall

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.760
model. And therefore it can be costly to implement.
