00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here I've written a Python procedure called uptoten.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If the argument you pass in in less than 10,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
it returns that argument, so if you pass in 5, it's going to return 5.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But it clamps values at 10. If you pass in 15, I'm just going to return 10.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I just showed you the similarity between Python and JavaScript before.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I would like you to write a JavaScript program.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Because we're going to be write a web browser that deals with JavaScript as strings,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I would like you to write your JavaScript program as one big string constant.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Call it "javascript" and submit via the interpreter.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You should declare a JavaScript function called uptoten

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that takes and argument x and does exactly the same thing as this Python one.

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Translate this Python code into JavaScript and then put it in this big string.
