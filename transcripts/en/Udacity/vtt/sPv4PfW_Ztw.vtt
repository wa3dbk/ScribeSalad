00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.320
So now let's go back to our split example. Let me

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.790
rearrange things a little bit to make more room. So now I'm

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.160
going to put the domains for size and for strength one next to

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.210
the other. So let's look at what some possible inputs will be

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.140
for the sub domains that we identified when we use the idea

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.790
of selecting input of the boundary. If we look at the first

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.860
subdomain, size less than zero, one reasonable input is, size equals to

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.360
minus 1, because minus 1 is the boundary value for the domain

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.530
of the integers less than zero. If we look at the third

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.119
subdomain, possibly interesting case is the one of size of equal to

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.900
1, for the same reasoning that we used for the previous subdomain,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.670
for size less than zero. And, let's try to select another one

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.870
for this subdomain, for the integers greater than zero. If there is

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.200
a concept of maximal integer, we can select that one as our

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.140
boundary value. And of course we could select much more, but this

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.630
is just to give you an idea. Other possible inputs. One interesting

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.310
example for the first one, string with length less than

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.690
size will be a string with length size minus one. Again

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.240
this is the boundary value for this domain. And we could

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.500
continue in this way like for example selecting a string who's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.310
length is exactly size as a boundary value for this

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.490
other domain. Instant one, and we look back actually to this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.940
example and look at it in a more extensive way when

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.690
we actually talk about a specific method for doing this kind

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.340
of process.
