jQuery makes it really easy to select specific elements in the DOM.

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:08.329
If I wanted to select an element like this one, for example, or

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:13.585
maybe if I wanted to collect a collection of elements like these two list items,

00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:17.920
I can use jQuery selectors to quickly access them.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.348
Remember how we could pass a string into the jQuery object?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.060
We call this string a jQuery selector in that it

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.530
allows us to select a part of the DOM.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.950
You can use jQuery to select a collection of DOM elements based on tag name,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.450
class name, or id.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.270
I'll start with selectors by tag name.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.370
Passing the string of the tag name will result in a jQuery collection of all

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.140
the elements of a certain tag.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.382
I'll test this by opening up my browser's JavaScript console on the Udacity Web

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.810
site, which, as you may remember, uses jQuery.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.580
If I wanted to do something with all the divs on the screen,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.480
I could select them by passing div into the jQuery object.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.360
And there we go.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.410
We can open up the object that got returned to see a collection of DOM elements.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.560
In a moment, you'll be trying out selectors by manipulating a real Web site.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.698
In index.html, you'll find the site's HTML.

00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:17.411
In an app.js, you'll be writing JavaScript to modify the page.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.280
You can press the Test Run button to see what the page looks like.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.220
Notice how we have this comment in the app.js file.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.126
For this quiz, set the listElements variable equal to a jQuery collection of

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:32.295
all the list elements on the page.

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:34.030
Hit Submit when you're done.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.250
Here's a quick hint.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.848
You can check your answer with a console.

00:01:36.848 --> 00:01:40.762
If you console.log the listElements variable, you can open up the browser

00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:44.631
console to see if you've selected the jQuery collection that you wanted.
