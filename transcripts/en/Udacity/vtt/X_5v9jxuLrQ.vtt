And the answer is it would be line 15. The reason for that is in

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.600
this column we actually have a value that includes a comma as part of the

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.010
data. What that would mean is that when we're processing this file, we would end

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.690
up having one extra field for this

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.350
particular row because of this comma right here.
