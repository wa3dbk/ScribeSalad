The next section is called Consequences. Which are the advantages and

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.109
disadvantages of using the pattern. One of the most important

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.300
elements of the pattern description is an understanding of what

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.740
tradeoffs using the pattern entails. For example, the composite pattern makes

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.520
the client interface simple at a possible cost of safety. That is,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.410
if we were to refactor the add operation into component. To make the interface

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.220
more uniform to clients, this might mean that leaves can have children. Which

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.150
wouldn't make any sense unless we put in some kind of ugly check to prevent it.
