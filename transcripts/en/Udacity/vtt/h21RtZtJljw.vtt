00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.860
The answer is, get the x and y values from the friend parameter. Friend is a

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.690
person object. And we've added x and y instance variables to all of the person

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.460
objects. The line should join our object to the friend it's adding. We can't

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.150
just use our own instance variables, x and y. Because then our line would start

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.960
and end at the same point, and wouldn't join both friends. We can't just use

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.927
the friend parameter. Because this isn't specific enough. We can't use x coord

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:36.130
and y coord. Because those variables aren't accessible anymore. And they

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.980
contain the first endpoint, not the second endpoint. We could add parameters to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.510
the addFriend method to take in the second endpoint of the line. But then every

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.640
time someone called addFriend, they would have to pass in the coordinates of

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.730
the friend they're adding. That would make the Person class harder to use.
