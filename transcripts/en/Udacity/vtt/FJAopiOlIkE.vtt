&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So to get from this expression to this expression, you could either first

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:08.137
place your cursor right here just to the left of this x and inside this opening

00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:12.630
parenthesis, and get rid of the inner set parenthesis first. Or alternatively,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.971
you could have started with the outer parenthesis, too. You put your cursor here

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.450
and then press Delete. And then, of course, go back to the inner one and do the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.547
same thing. Order here does not matter as long as you're following this rule.
