00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.390
The URL that we built looks good, and the JSON string from the server,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.440
also looks good, however, it still is one long string.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.170
Let's look at it more carefully to see what data, we should extract from it.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.400
In order to make sense of the string that comes back from the server.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.090
We can put it through a JSON formatter or a JSON prettifier.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.710
If you Google for

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.810
those terms, you'll be able to find a helpful tool, such as this one.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.570
Here we pasted the result of the web query.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.749
Then it formatted the output for us, showing us the hierarchy of these element.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.890
Now based on the wire frames that you saw for the sunshine app,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.680
can you tell us which of these leaf nodes we care about extracting?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.210
Even though we will have to traverse through parent nodes, for the purposes of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.870
the quiz on the next screen, we're just looking at the leaf nodes.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.740
Make your selection below on which attributes we'll need to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.450
display the list of forecasts.
