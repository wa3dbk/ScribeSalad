00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:01.306
So, here's an issue.

00:00:01.306 --> 00:00:05.820
What happens when the size at which you
want to draw a texture is different from

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.840
the size the texture actually is?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.349
For instance, this center image is
the actual size of the GigaGal texture.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.110
That's one pixel in the texture
is one pixel on the screen.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.066
Well we have two very different ways
of drawing GigaGal at six times her

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.080
normal size.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.276
The way we choose the color of the extra
pixels that are added when we scale up

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.086
a texture is called filtering.

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:31.569
On the left, we're using
nearest neighbor interpolation.

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.420
That is to say that we
just pick the nearest

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.393
pixel in the original image to figure
out what color to color a new pixel.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.190
Over here, we're using linear filtering,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.840
which uses a linear combination of
the nearby pixels to select a new color.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.454
Basically, average it.

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:52.592
Now, in most cases, especially if you're
only making the texture a little bit

00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:55.883
bigger, linear filtering will
tend to preserve more detail.

00:00:55.883 --> 00:00:59.881
But it's also a little bit more
costly from a graphics point of view.

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.834
However, since all the textures for
GigaGal are in this pixel art style,

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.579
we'll be using nearest
neighbor interpolation or

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.415
nearest neighbor filtering for
most of this class.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:13.355
LibGDX provides a third type of
filtering called MIP mapping.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.865
And that is where it precomputes a bunch
of versions of the texture at different

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:18.422
scales.

00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:21.624
This is most useful when the size of
a texture is going to be changing

00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:25.701
dramatically over the course of a game,
which mostly happens in 3D applications.

00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:27.110
So we're not going to
worry about it here,
