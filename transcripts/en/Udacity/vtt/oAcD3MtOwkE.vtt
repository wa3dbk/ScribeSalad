00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This was potentially a difficult quiz, requires you to think about outside the box

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of what I normally ask.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We can implement optimization okay so that it returns a safe answer for optimization in all cases.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Remember how are we using optimization okay?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We consider a bunch of optimizations, and if this says True, then we swap out parts of the program.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A safe answer is just to return false all the time,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
never do any optimization.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That'll make for a slower programs, but it's safe because we'll always get the same answer.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We're never changing the meaning of the program.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Optimization is sometimes described as conservative because if you're not

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
absolutely certain that an optimization is okay, just be conservative and don't do it,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and you'll be fine. The program will be a little slower, but it'll always get the right answer.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We cannot implement and optimization okay that works precisely in all cases.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It is undecidable like the Halting Problem.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This sadly is true.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm going to sketch an answer for this.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
A formal proof that something is impossible, like the Halting Problem,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is a little beyond the scope of most of this class.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But let me show you how it would go.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Suppose we could write optimization okay in a way that was

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
precisely correct in all cases.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I, the Great Wesini, shall solve the Halting Problem

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
by telling you if an arbitrary program halts or not.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You want to know if a program P halts or not.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm going to tell you how to do it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Remember, we know this is impossible.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Here's how we do it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Suppose you claim we've implemented optimization_ok.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It always gets exactly the right answer.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm going to use it to build a Halting Problem solver.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You give me a program P and you want to know if it halts?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I just make up a little program over here called "loops forever" or "loops."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This procedure loops sets x to zero and while True, it increments x.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We've seen before that this program never terminates, never returns a value.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I can just check to see if your program ever halts by checking to see if it would be

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
okay to replace it with loops forever.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If your program gets the same answer on all inputs as loops forever,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
then your program loops forever on all inputs.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Otherwise, your program halts.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If optimization_ok could be written, then the Halting Problem could be written--

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
this Halting Problem decider. But this cannot be.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We've seen before that there is no way to solve the Halting Problem.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's equivalent to figuring out if "this sentence is false" is true or false.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's a contradiction in the real world.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So halts is impossible, but I could totally make halts if I had optimization_ok.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
That means optimization_ok must me impossible--impossible to solve every time precisely.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We can solve it some of the time. We just can't solve it all of the time.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Because if we could solve it all of the time, it'd be just like the Halting Problem.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Then finally down here at the end--

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
optimization_ok of AB implies optimization_ok of BA.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This is true because we're just checking equality.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
If A = B, then B = A.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now the two I've picked--George F Will, a Pulitzer Prize-winning conservative commentator,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and Betty Frieden who wrote The Feminine Mystique

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and lead second-wave feminism in the United States--

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
they're unlikely to have exactly the same things to say.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
These two are unlikely to be equal, but if they were

00:03:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
then you could reverse it, and they would match up. You never know. Check them both out.
