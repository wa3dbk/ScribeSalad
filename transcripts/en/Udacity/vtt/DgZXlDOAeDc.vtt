00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.740
So the answer to the problem, as you may
have found out is 5. But there are

00:00:03.752 --> 00:00:07.841
actually two different ways that you can
solve this problem. Let's go through both

00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:12.042
of them. So, if you remember our order of
operations acronym, PEMDADS&gt; This tells us

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:16.081
that, before we do any subtraction, which
we'll have to do right here. We need to

00:00:16.093 --> 00:00:20.078
deal with whatever's happening inside
parentheses. So if we were following this

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.400
set of rules, we would say that this is
equal to 10 minus dealing with what's

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:29.455
inside the parentheses, 2+3 is 5, and then
we would do the subtraction, 10-5 is 5.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:34.550
However, as we saw in dealing with the
equation that we gave to Grant, there's a

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:39.315
way to get rid of parentheses, so that we
can solve this problem in different way.

00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:43.348
Let's pretend that the numbers that we
have up here actually refer to some

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.776
objects. Let's say these circles that I
have done here right now. So, here are ten

00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:52.104
circles and I want to figure how to modify
these super circles in accordance with

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:56.938
this expression. So we have ten vice, and
then you want to get rid of 2+3 of them.

00:00:57.052 --> 00:01:02.801
So if we did the problem the original way,
where we have 10-5 circles. Then we would

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:08.100
just count out five of these 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, select just those ones and then get rid

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:13.072
of them. And then in the end we're left
with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, five circles. However,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.888
let's talk about how to do the problem in
the other way. Instead of grouping the

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.601
circles that we want to get rid of as one
whole group, as we did in the first way,

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.444
so that's by dealing with what's inside
the parenthesis first, and circling all

00:01:24.456 --> 00:01:28.184
five of the circles we want to get rid of,
let's think about these as two separate

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:32.009
groups. So, we know that we want to get
rid of two circles. So that's just these

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:35.326
two and we also want to get rid of three
circles. Now instead of merging these into

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:38.668
one group like we did the first way, why
don't we just get rid of each of them

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.054
separately since we know that we need to
get rid of this whole thing. So first

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.302
we'll get rid of these two and then we'll
get rid of these three as well and in the

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:48.569
end we' re left with the same five circles
that were when we did the problem the

00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:52.350
first way. So what we really did was
subtract two circles. So 10 minus 2

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:58.415
circles and then we subtracted the 3. So
this gave us, our final five circles.
