00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.364
The equation of the vertical line that goes through the point negative 5 6 is x

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:08.574
equals negative five. What do we know about vertical lines? We know that

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:13.285
vertical lines look like this. We know that vertical lines have undefined slope,

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:17.356
and we also know that the equation of a vertical line is always going to be x

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:22.383
equals a constant. Since this vertical line goes through the point Negative 5,

00:00:22.383 --> 00:00:27.243
6. We know that no matter what value y is, x is always going to remain at

00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:33.029
negative 5. So, the equation of the vertical line through the point negative 5,

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:38.840
6 is X equals negative 5. For the second problem, the equation of the horizontal

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.400
line that goes to the point negative 5, 6 is Y equals 6. What do we know about

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.596
horizontal lines? We know they go left to right, or right to left. We know that

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:56.754
the slope is 0, and we know their equation looks like y equals a constant. Now

00:00:56.754 --> 00:01:02.676
if we know that this horizontal line goes to the point negative 5,6, if I plot

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:08.692
the point negative 5,6 on this horizontal line what I notice is no matter what

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:14.382
value x is, y is always going to be 6. So I get the equation y equals 6. If you

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:17.287
got these answers right, great work.
