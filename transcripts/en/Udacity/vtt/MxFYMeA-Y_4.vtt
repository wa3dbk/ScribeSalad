00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.450
We've covered what machine
learning is and what it can do.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.360
Now let's dive in a little
bit to how it works.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.070
To close this foundation section we
want to start with a couple of simple

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.930
examples of machine learning in
action from Sebastian's artificial

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.720
intelligence course.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.310
Note how these methods can be described
as finding ways to build models of data.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.000
We'll also cover a bit of vocabulary
that you'll need to know later in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.090
the nano-degree program,
like classification and regression.
