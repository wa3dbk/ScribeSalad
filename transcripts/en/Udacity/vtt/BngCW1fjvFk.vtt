00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.820
So we're trying to find where 8.94 falls on this distribution. So it looks likes

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.014
it's about here, so this z score is going to be really high. For this one the z

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:15.954
score falls about here, which looks like it's still kind of in the center of the

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:21.715
sampling distribution, so now if we calculate the actual z score... We'll do

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:28.358
8.94 minus the population mean, which is also the mean of sample means. And then

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:32.628
divide by this standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Now to keep

00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:37.748
things more precise, instead of using the rounded standard error, I'm going to

00:00:37.748 --> 00:00:42.240
put this in my calculator. It's okay if you used the rounded error. You should

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.305
have still gotten it right. So if we do it like this, we get about 10.06. Which

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:53.922
is pretty big. And here if we calculate z-score. We'll say 8.35 minus the mean

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:58.920
of the sampling distribution. Divided by the standard deviation of the sampling

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.260
distribution. So we get about 0.92. We're going to call this zees of en, zees of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.473
l. So now what's next?
