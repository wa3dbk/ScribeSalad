00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
The first statement is false.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.010
All problems solvable in exponential time by a deterministic RAM

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.220
take polynomial time on a nondeterministic RAM. This is not true.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.980
There are problems that would still take exponential time on both a deterministric RAM

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.210
and a nondeterministric RAM.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.200
For example, if you wanted to find every sublist of a list.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.520
This is going to exponential time even on a nondeterministic RAM.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.750
The second statement is also false,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.970
because if randomized algorithms could solve some NP-complete problems,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.130
let's say vertex cover, in expected polynomial time, well by the definition of NP-completeness

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.910
then we could reduce any other NP-complete problem to vertex cover

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.350
and then solve that in expected polynomial time.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.360
There's no evidence that this is actually the case.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.450
The final statement is true.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.860
If P≠NP, then there are some NP-complete problems that don't have constant-factor

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.620
approximation algorithms that can run in polynomial time.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.370
The reason for this is actually the converse.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.130
We know that if we can find a constant-factor approximation algorithm

00:01:08.130 --> 99:59:59.000
that runs in polynomial time for any NP-complete problem, then that implies that P=NP.
