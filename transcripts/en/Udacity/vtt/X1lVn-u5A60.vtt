00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What you can see now is that, although we have formally proven that our code

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
cannot violate this assertion, there still may be other issues,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which simply aren't properly specified yet.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So any proof can only be as good as the specification it relies on.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Which, of course, again is a call for good assertions.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Because if you do have good assertions, you get good specifications, and this

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
will not only help you a lot in debugging, you will also improve your testing,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and as we have seen, it may even enable the use of automated deduction tool.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But now, for a programming exercise.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It really, really annoys me that this function isn't entirely done yet.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Please go take this function and fix it such that this html markup is properly removed.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I promise this will be the last time we are going to be fixing this function.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Over to you.
