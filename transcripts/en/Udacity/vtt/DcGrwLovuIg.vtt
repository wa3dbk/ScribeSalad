The connection between encoding and remembering at its core is levles of

00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:08.317
processing. For this concept, psychologist say the more deeply we encode

00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:13.164
information the better we are able to recall it. Now, what do we mean by

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:16.349
deeply? Psychologist have been able to identify three different levels of

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.860
processing. Before I get started in describing this, I want you to remember

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.550
these three words, tablet, bell, amethyst. Okay, let's get started. The first

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.472
is structural, the second is phoentic, and the third is semantic. So for the

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:38.840
level of processing structural would be shallow. Then we'd go down to semantic,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.480
which would be deep. And remember, the more deeply encoded the information, the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.365
better we recall it. So, let's look at probability of recall. The shallow level

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:53.706
of processing would give us a low probability of recalling the information. And

00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:58.775
a deep level of processing would give us a high probability of recall. Let's

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:03.000
say for example I wanted you to remember the word Amethyst. At the structural

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.540
level, I may ask you to describe whether the word has capital letters or

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.275
lowercase letters. At the phonetic level, I may ask you to think of words that

00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:16.407
rhyme with amethyst. And finally, at the semantic level I may ask you to

00:01:16.407 --> 00:01:21.633
describe what an amethyst is. It's purple, it's in fact a stone, and it's even

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:26.705
the birthstone for the month of February. Here, a psychologist would say, if

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:30.930
you're able to engage in all three levels of processing, semantic, phonetic,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.090
and structural, we would have a better ability to recall the information at a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.010
later time.
