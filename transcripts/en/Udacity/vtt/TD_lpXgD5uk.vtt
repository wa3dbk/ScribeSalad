00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.296
Our critical numbers tell us how to separate the number line into different

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:08.824
regions or different intervals for us to test, using this inequality. So check

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:13.244
each of those three regions that are separated by these critical numbers, and

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:17.757
also check the critical numbers themselves in the inequality. And then figure

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:22.071
out for which intervals values of x satisfy this inequality. I'd like you to

00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:24.945
write these intervals as inequalities, however.
