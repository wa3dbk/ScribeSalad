00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
The algorithm is correct, or the search tree is correct,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.190
because it still tries all possibilities;

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.360
it's just smarter about avoiding stupid possibilities.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.120
And what I mean by this is basically that it deliberately avoids this case here

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.240
where you have 2 endpoints of an edge not being in the vertex cover,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.690
so it tries to avoid those.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.330
Are there special cases where the algorithm could be wrong? No.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.710
It still searches through all possibilities.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.070
Again, it just does so in an intelligent way to avoid making any stupid choices.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.270
Does the search tree at each level determine the assignment of at least 1 vertex? Yes.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.740
That one is definitely true because if all edges would be covered,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.400
then the algorithm would be done; the search tree would not go much further.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.200
The usual case would be that we actually do an assignment for 2 vertices,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.330
and this will also tell you something about the answer down here.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.760
So usually when we have an edge that is not covered,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.970
we will have the case that we actually determine the assignment for 2 vertices.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.550
There is 1 special case, and if you have found that special case yourself,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.680
then you have truly understood search trees.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.970
But if you haven't, then just listen closely and don't worry too much about it.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.730
There might be the following case, where you have an edge that is not yet covered

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.430
but you've already made the decision for 1 of the endpoints.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.750
The question is now what to do with this one here.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.400
But this is actually a case that is rather easy

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.500
because here we don't really have to make a choice anymore

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.670
because we know this edge must be covered.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.860
So whenever we decide for 1 vertex that it is not going to be part of the vertex cover,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.330
then we can put all of its neighbors into the vertex cover automatically.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.160
We do not need to make a choice here anymore,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.940
and this is why we can construct the search tree so that at each level

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.780
we determine the assignment of at least 2 vertices.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.240
Just to make this very clear, let me show you this again here in this example.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.050
Let's go back 1 level.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.940
When we made the choice here to not put this vertex into the vertex cover,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.100
we could immediately also have said that this vertex here must be part of the vertex cover

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.290
because otherwise this edge here cannot be covered and we would already have been done.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.180
And the same thing up here.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.810
So if we decide that this vertex is not part of the vertex cover,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.130
then we immediately know that this vertex must come into the vertex cover

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.840
because otherwise this edge here would not be covered,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.670
and we also know because of this edge here that we have to put this vertex here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.200
into the vertex cover, so we are also done, having found a slightly larger solution.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.810
The only thing where we still need to make a decision is this part down here.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.030
There we can still go into 3 cases, either putting that one into the vertex cover, that one, or both.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.700
And this is of course something that an algorithm can do as well.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.000
So actually, we get down to 5 assignments here,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.530
which already makes this search tree better than the one we started out with.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.800
But now comes the really cool part

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.320
because once we know that we can construct the search tree

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.650
so that at each level we determine the assignment of at least 2 vertices,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.340
we can do a pretty, pretty cool worst case analysis of that search tree.

00:02:52.340 --> 99:59:59.000
So let me show you.
