00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.280
Now it's time to try coding the Gaussian
elimination algorithm ourselves.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.470
To start us off,
I've written the template for

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.730
a python module that represents
a system of linear equations.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.860
I'll give a brief overview of it here.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.780
It is also available for download in the
downloadable section in this segment and

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.260
the rest of the lesson.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.190
We can initialize a new
linear system object

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.010
by providing a list of plain objects.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.120
The initializer make sure all of our
planes live in the same dimension.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.340
So we can't mix planes living
in three-dimensional space

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.020
with objects such as lines
living in two-dimensional space.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.930
There are currently
three empty functions.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.830
Swap rows, multiply coefficient and
row, and add multiple times row to row.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.074
These will be the focus of the first
stage of building the Gaussian

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:49.610
elimination algorithm.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.100
There's also a function which
obtains which term of each equation

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.900
is the first non-zero term.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.570
This will be useful for finding
the pivot variables in each equation.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.920
Note that the terms are zero
index instead of one indexed.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.550
Though we shouldn't need
to worry about that.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.120
Since we won't be directly manipulating
the indices of the lists that make up

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.240
the system.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.510
We also have some utility
functions available to us.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.294
The LEN function returns how
many planes are in the system.

00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:17.780
In other words,
how many equations are in the system.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.560
We can also use subscript notation
to access a particular plane, or

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.020
equation in the system.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.380
As demonstrated in the example
code at the bottom of the module.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.120
There's also an str
method that let's us print

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.480
a pretty version of
the system of equations.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.340
Finally, in the module I've included
a simple extension of the decimal class.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.570
It gives us the ability to quickly
check whether a decimal object

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.770
is within a given tolerance to zero.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.470
In this case, the default
tolerance is ten to the minus ten.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.750
If you execute the test code given
at the bottom of the module.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.060
You can see the output of these
functions on an example system.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.310
Feel free to take some time to
play around with this example.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.500
For instance, by changing
the coefficients to get a feel for

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.700
the functionality of
the linear system class.
