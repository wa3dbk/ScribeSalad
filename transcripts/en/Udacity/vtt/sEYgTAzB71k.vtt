00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.861
In this equation, h equals negative 3. We see h appear in two spots in the

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:10.267
general equation. We have a term minus 2hx, and also a term h squared. And the h

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:14.997
squared is going to be a little bit harder for us to pick out using this

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:19.784
equation. Since we have one constant term of 5 over here, but we have two

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:24.741
constant terms each squared and k here. And we can't tell which of these is

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:29.946
contributing how much to 5. However, we have one term in the general equation

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:35.146
that has an x to the first. And also only one term in the particular equation

00:00:35.146 --> 00:00:40.407
that has an x to the first. So that means that we have negative 2hx is equal to

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:45.593
6x, just matching those terms up. To get h by itself, we just need to divide

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:50.864
both sides of the equation by negative 2x. Our xes will cancel out. And 6

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:56.272
divided by negative 2 is just negative 3. So that's our answer.
