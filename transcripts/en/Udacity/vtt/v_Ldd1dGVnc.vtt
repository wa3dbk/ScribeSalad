00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.044
One common way of giving a cartoon like appearance to a surface is to give it

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:07.320
two or more shades of the same color. For example, in this drawing the sheep's

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.268
wool has just two tones, light and dark. You're going to do the same sort of

00:00:11.268 --> 00:00:14.690
thing with the diffuse shader we just described. The idea is to modify the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.068
diffuse component. In the diffuse shader code we computed this value by taking

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:21.954
the dot product of the normal and the light. Instead of using the diffuse

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:26.200
component for the shade, we really want to identify two zones. Light and dark.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.972
If the normal is pointing some fair bit towards the light, consider the area

00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:33.407
lit. Otherwise, it's dark. Take this sphere as an example. Normally we clamp

00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:37.103
the diffuse term at zero and not let it go negative. Above zero and the light

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:41.021
has greater and greater contribution as the dot product increases. This is

00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:44.896
realistic, but we can do whatever we want in the shader. One idea to get a two

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:49.195
tone effect is define a critical angle, essentially a dot product value. Below

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:53.379
this value will make the surface uniformly dark, otherwise it's fully lit.
