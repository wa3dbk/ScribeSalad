00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.860
The language that you will learn in order to talk to the computer, is called

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.660
Java. The name Java was chosen for fun. Many programmers drink lots of coffee.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.030
And some people call coffee, Java, because of the island of Java. They grow

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.220
coffee. Whatever. We've chosen Java, for a number of reasons. Java is very,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.220
very popular. There are millions of programmers who are familiar with Java and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.530
who use it every day on the job. Java is as programming languages go, pretty

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.345
simple for the most part. There are a few rough edges because Java was not

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:38.680
designed as a training wheels language for students. It really is a real word

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.170
programming language. But, that's okay. Java is safe. And, that's great for

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.370
students. When you make an error, you'll get a very clear indication of what

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.140
went wrong, and it'll be easy for you to fix it. And finally, Java is very

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.170
useful for the kinds of everyday tasks that you might encounter. Processing

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.650
text, processing images, dealing with the web. In this course, you will learn.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.910
To use Java in such a way that you can simplify your own work. So again, what

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.768
is Java? Java is a programming language, a language to write instructions for

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:19.020
the computer that is popular, simple, safe, and useful. Let's get going to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.955
write some programs in Java.
