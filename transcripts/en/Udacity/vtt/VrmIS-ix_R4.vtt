00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One more function to write--add_suffixes--and then we'll be done with this bird.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're given the start location.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We recover the location in which we want to place the anchor letter,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which is start at the start and then add in however much of the prefix we have.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It could be the empty string. It could be more.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If the prefix is already a word, then we want to add in a possible play.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The play is starting in the start location we put in this word.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But there is also this test.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This test says we want to make sure that we've at least anchored the prefix.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What does that mean?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If we go back to our diagram, if we're right here, we get passed in to add_suffixes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the prefix B-E--that is, in fact, a word. B-E is in our dictionary,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but we wouldn't want to say the answer is B-E,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because that's not a play. That was already on the board.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We can't say our play is we're making this word that's already there.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We've got to add at least one letter.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That's why when we were defining row plays, we said we're adding suffixes,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but we haven't anchored it yet. Anchored is equal to False.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We haven't anchored our potential prefix so far so don't go reporting that prefix as a valid play.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now in the definition of add_suffixes, we say, okay, if it's the first time through,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we're not anchored so we're not going return BE as a possible play,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but when I do a recursive call to add_suffix, I'll just have the default value and anchor will be true.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I will have played on the anchor, and then I'll be okay from then on.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
One additional test here is saying if there are existing letters already on the board,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and you're bumping into them, then you have to count them.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If there's a letter already there, don't report everything up to that letter.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That's taken care of this case when we get up to this C, we can't like say put a T here

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and have B-E-T and report that by itself as a word,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
because the T is running into the C.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We've got to continue and see what words can we have--we have to account this C here.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Okay. That takes care of adding in the play.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Whether or not we found a valid play to add to our list of results,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we still want to say are we going to continue?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Can we keep going to the right adding on more letters?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Well if the pre we have so far is within the prefixes, then yes we do want to try to continue.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
What we'll do is say tell me what square is in the current position in the row.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
If it's a letter, try to add suffixes to that--

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to the prefix we have so far plus the letter.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
If there is a letter already on the board, it's mandatory that we have to use it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Otherwise, if the square is empty, then we want to figure out what are all

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the possible letters that we could place into that empty square.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
If the square is an anchor, then the anchor will tell us what the possibilities are.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Remember an anchor is a set of possible letters,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
so if the square is an anchor, let's use that as a set of possibilities.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Otherwise, if the square is empty and it's not an anchor,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
then any letter is a possibility.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Now we just go through the letters in our hand and say, if that letter is a possibility,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
then we want to add a new suffix by saying let's place that letter onto the prefix,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
remove the letter form our hand, and continue adding suffixes from there.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
When we're done that, return the results. That's it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Now we're done with that bird, but let's go back, look at our test routine.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We had these tests for legal prefix.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now, if we go into our interpreter and we run row_plays with the given hand and the row--

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that's this row where the hand is maybe ABCEHKN.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
This is the result we get. That's an awesome result.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Look, we got the BACKBENCH that we saw before.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We got all the smaller words. We can go through and we can check that each of these makes sense.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They are the right ones. They don't run into any letters or do anything wrong.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's hard to check that we go all of them right,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but we can still go ahead and make this an assertion.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
When we run this, all the tests pass and life is good.
