00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.060
So, as Dr.Rosenberg just described, it was Charles Darwin who first, conducted

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.371
research on emotion expression. He argued that emotions were expressed

00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:15.674
similarly in humans, and in even non-human animals sometimes. And this is the

00:00:15.674 --> 00:00:20.075
idea of universality. Emotions are universally expressed, in similar ways, all

00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:23.916
over the world. So a smile, for instance, is a smile regardless of who

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:28.926
expresses it. But Darwin's work was not systematic. So in the 1960's, Paul

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:35.287
Ekman and his colleague Wallace Friesen took up Darwin's work. And became more

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:40.068
systematic and more scientific. They conducted research on universality in

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:45.010
western cultures, and found universality. That is, people expressed emotions

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.377
very much the same way, and interpreted them very much the same way. But this

00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:55.136
was just in the west. It wasn't a true test of universality. So, in the late

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:59.735
1960s, Paul Ekman and an anthropologist went to Papua New Guinea to conduct

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:04.929
research. And they went to Papua New Guinea because it was a preliterate

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:10.250
culture that had no contact whatsoever at that time to the west. And he found

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.353
evidence for universality, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and

00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:21.158
surprise. And later on, he and his colleagues, found universal evidence for

00:01:21.158 --> 00:01:22.679
contempt.
