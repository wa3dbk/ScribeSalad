00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.029
As you learned in the previous lesson,

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.620
focus determines where keyboard
events go in the page.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.810
To give you an example, if I go over and
focus this text input field using

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.670
my mouse and then begin typing, the
input receives the keyboard events and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.210
displays the characters
as I've typed them.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.510
The currently focused item is
often indicated by a focus ring,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.770
where the actual styling of that
ring depends on the browser and

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.030
any additional styling that
the page author may have applied.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.050
As a user,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.560
you can control which element is
currently focused using your keyboard.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.512
Pressing the Tab key will move
focus forward through the document.

00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:37.103
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.510
Shift+Tab moves focus backwards.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.260
And you can use the arrow keys to
move focus around within a component.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.350
On MacOS X,
this works a little differently.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.785
While Chrome will always let you
navigate with Tab, you'll need

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.851
to press Option+Tab in order to change
focus in other browsers like Safari.

00:00:57.851 --> 00:01:02.304
If you like, you can change this by
going to your System Preferences,

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:06.455
going to the Keyboard section,
clicking on the Shortcuts tab and

00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:09.794
then changing this radio
group to say All controls.

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:14.430
To give you an example of focus in
the real world, here I am on Wikipedia,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.066
and as I press the Tab key, the browser
is going to navigate through all of

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.424
the focusable elements on the page.

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:24.097
Eventually I'll reach a stopping
point and hit Shift+Tab and

00:01:24.097 --> 00:01:26.800
now I'm moving backwards
through the page.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.650
This ordering is called,
creatively enough, the tab order.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.660
And making sure your application has a
logical tab order is an important step,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.680
which we're going to cover
later on in this course.

00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:42.070
Now built-in interactive HTML
elements like input, button, and

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.170
select are all implicitly focusable.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.890
Meaning that they're automatically
inserted in the tab order and

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.220
that they also have built-in
keyboard event handling.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.630
But not all elements are focusable.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.050
This header, the paragraph below it,
and this image are not focusable, and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.049
they're not implicitly
inserted in the tab order.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.399
And that's by design.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.310
There's generally no need
to focus something if

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.076
a user can't interact with it or
provide it some sort of input.
