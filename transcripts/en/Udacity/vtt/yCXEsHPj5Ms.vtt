00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.597
Up to this point, we've been working with opaque materials. Where light hits the

00:00:03.597 --> 00:00:07.785
surface, and bounces off. For a number of reasons, transparent objects are more

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:12.314
challenging. First, light refracts, and so changes its direction when it hits a

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:16.652
transparent surface. For example, here light comes from the surface of the

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:21.068
pencil, travels through water, and hits the glass. The glass causes the light to

00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:25.570
go in a different direction. Such the different light rays reach our eyes and

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.629
cause the pencil to look bent. This change in direction can also affect the

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:34.482
distribution of light on a surface. This crystal ball acts similarly to a lens,

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:39.480
focusing the light and creating various bright spots below it. In computer

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.225
graphics, we call these bright spots caustics. The color and the intensity of

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:48.478
the light can be filtered by the transparent object. The farther a ray of light

00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:52.252
travels through an object, the more light that can be absorbed. Even thin

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:56.848
filters can change the color of the light. All of these effects can be simulated

00:00:56.848 --> 00:01:01.698
or at least approximated in a convincing way. Refraction where the light changes

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:06.112
direction is expensive to do correctly. I'll be discussing it further in later

00:01:06.112 --> 00:01:10.160
lessons. It's also possible to computer the amount of light absorbed due to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.558
traveling through an object, though this can be costly. In the following

00:01:13.558 --> 00:01:17.774
lessons, I'm going to focus on absorption of light by thin transparent surfaces,

00:01:17.774 --> 00:01:22.082
such as these eyeglass filters. To simplify further still, I'll be talking about

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.354
only the effect of such filters on objects visible through them. In other words,

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:30.910
I won't be talking about how light passes through such a filter, reaches another

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.930
surface, and then travels to the eye. I'll only be talking about light that

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.623
travels from the object through the filter. This all sounds like a lot of

00:01:38.623 --> 00:01:42.466
simplification, but you can get wonderful effects from just this form of

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:47.810
filtering alone. For example, this fantastic demo made by Alexander Roddick

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.732
shows how transparency can be used to effect. There are other cool effects going

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:56.938
on here, such as the God rays of light. But transparency is what really makes

00:01:56.938 --> 00:02:06.985
this demo shine. It's 1 of my favorite Web GL programs. .
