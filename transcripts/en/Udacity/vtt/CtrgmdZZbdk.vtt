00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
So for 60 percent I want to do per cent, or divided by 100. I know dividing by

00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:10.086
100 moves the decimal place 2 places left. So I get point 6, or 6 10ths. For all

00:00:10.098 --> 00:00:15.543
these percents I'm going to need to move thee decimal two places left and divide

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:20.536
by 100. So I get 5 10,000ths. Here again I'm going to move the decimal two

00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:25.651
places left. And I get .5302, here when I move the decimal 2 places left I get 2

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:30.410
extra 0's and my decimal point ends up here. So I get this number. Again I move

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:34.754
the decimal 2 places left and I wind up with 30. It's probably easier to

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:39.395
remember how to go from a percent to a decimal. You just think about what the

00:00:39.407 --> 00:00:44.448
word percent means. It means per 100, or divided by 100. So, to go from a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.171
decimal to a percent, we need to undo that dividing by 100. So we multiply it by

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:56.395
100. So 52 times 100 is 5200%. Multiplying four thousandths by 100 gives me 4%,.

00:00:56.672 --> 00:01:02.268
and multiplying 1.35 by 100 gives me 135%. Notice that each time I convert a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.153
decimal to a percent, the decimal place moved two places to the right. Now that

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:12.606
we can work with decimals and percents, let's go back to our shoe problem.
