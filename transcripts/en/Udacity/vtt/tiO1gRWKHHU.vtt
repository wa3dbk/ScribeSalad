00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
So now one final piece of information.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.990
Let's compare the length of the shortest tour for the input graph

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.540
with the length of the tour that the algorithm computes.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.110
So, again we're going to have the length of this tour,

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.110
and by this I mean the one output by the algorithm,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.150
and compare that to the length of the shortest tour.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.660
Again, I would like you to tell me what I should put here.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.310
Is the length of the tour computed by the algorithm

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.220
smaller than the length of the shortest tour,

00:00:29.220 --> 99:59:59.000
is it at most as large, is it equal, is it bigger, or is it at least as large?
