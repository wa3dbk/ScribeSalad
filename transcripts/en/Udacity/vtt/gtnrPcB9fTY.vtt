00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.242
So the Stratton Taxonomy's 6th optimization technique is called compaction.

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:07.614
And John has described compaction a couple of times.

00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:10.822
He described it in unit 4 and revisited it in unit 6,

00:00:10.822 --> 00:00:14.324
where it comes up in sparse matrix vector multiply and in-graph traversal.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:18.541
So I'm not going to go into great length describing what compaction is.

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.130
Just as a quick review,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.698
compaction is useful when you have a computation to perform

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:27.865
on a set of elements but the exact elements that require computation are not known in advance.

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:30.537
If most of the elements require computation,

00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:33.874
then its simplest just to assign threads to every element

00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:37.938
and just have every thread check to see whether they should process or not.

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.848
The threads that are active will do whatever they are suppose to do.

00:00:40.848 --> 00:00:43.932
The threads that will not will simply return.

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:46.349
In that case you will end up storing something valid--

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:48.756
some valid output in most cells

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:51.290
and the cells in the output are the--

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.958
the elements in the output where the thread wasn't active,

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.361
because it didn't need to be processed you will end up with leaving blank.

00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:00.573
Now if relatively few of the elements require computation,

00:01:00.573 --> 00:01:04.268
then you're wasting a lot of storage on the output,

00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:06.271
and you're doing less efficient computation,

00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:11.314
because a lot of your threads are sitting idol, instead of doing some sort of useful work.

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:16.083
Compacting the elements means creating a dense array containing only active elements.

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:20.150
So that then you can do your processing on the stents array,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.887
producing a dense output array directly.

00:01:22.887 --> 00:01:27.427
You're not wasting storage on all these invalid, null output elements,

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:30.431
and you're not wasting computation

00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:33.494
on all these threads that are just sitting around not doing anything

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.969
while the other threads in their thread block are--

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.211
the relatively few threads in this thread block

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.404
that have active elements have have anything useful to do.

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:45.164
So as a quiz, suppose that only every 8th element will be processed.

00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:47.916
So here I've drawn the elements that will be processed

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:49.643
and all the ones I've left blank will not be processed.

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:53.792
And the idea is that every 8th element--it requires processing.

00:01:53.792 --> 00:01:55.953
And assume that we're compute limited;

00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:59.858
in other words, that whatever operation is we're going to do on these every 8 elements

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:01.795
is expensive,

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:06.563
and that's the limiting factor rather than the memory bandwidth to fetch elements.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:09.699
So assume that we are limited by computation and not memory bandwidth.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.803
So the question is about how much less time

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:14.690
will the computation take

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.941
if a thread is launched to run on every element of the compacted array

00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:22.049
rather than if the thread is launched to run for every element of the original array?

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.695
In other words, how much faster is it going to be to run on a compacted array?

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:31.531
Will it be 8x faster, will it be 4x faster, will it be the same speed, 1x faster?

00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:33.443
And then I want to ask,

00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:36.531
what if only every 32nd element will be processed,

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.131
and what if only 128th element must be processed?

00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:45.689
So for the answer I'm looking for an integer like 4 or 8 or 16 or 32 or 1,

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:53.523
and you're telling me whether its 4 times faster, 8 times faster, 1 times faster and so on.
