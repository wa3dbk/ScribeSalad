00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.638
You're going to see a lot of new topics
and new ideas in this nanodegree.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:08.000
Because you're going to see so
many, it means

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.910
we're just not going to be able to focus
on acquiring fluency because, remember,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.900
fluency generally takes a really long
time to acquire in even one thing.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.875
So, instead, the goal's going to
be to get to ability In the most

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:25.080
important topics that are fundamental
throughout programming.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.510
In addition, you're going to
gain awareness of many topics,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.145
and through this combination of
awareness and ability, you're

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:39.685
going to have the skills to do amazing
things, as well as the understanding

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:43.215
of what you need to do next depending
on your own personal goals.

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:44.655
Maybe you want to make a webpage.

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:47.105
Maybe you want to get a job
as a front end developer.

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.645
Right now you probably wouldn't
even know where to begin.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.225
But, at the end of this nano degree
you'll have enough ability and

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:54.480
awareness to make informed decisions.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
But along the way,
you will experience frustration.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.295
Frustration happens whenever you do
something in which you're not fluent,

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.150
and in computer programming,
it happens even if you are fluent.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.490
What this means is at some point during
this journey, you're probably going to

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.050
have some thoughts, thoughts like,
why can't I get this?

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.970
Or why won't this work?

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.910
Or why is this so hard for me?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.010
I know I had all of these thoughts,
and everyone goes through them.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.660
But it's not frustration that's the real
problem, frustration is inevitable.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.920
The problem happens when this
frustration turns into something worse.
