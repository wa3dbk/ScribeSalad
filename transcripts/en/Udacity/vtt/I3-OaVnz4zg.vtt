00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.430
One bad pattern that some mobile developers got into

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.820
was detecting if touch was supported on the device, and

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.840
if so, only supporting touch, not adding the mouse

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.720
handlers at all. That's a bad idea. If you do

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.590
this, my Chromebook Pixel will only get touch support

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.480
and the trackpad won't work. Instead, you want touch support

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000
to be purely additive, like this. Notice, that the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.020
mouse handlers are still added, even if touch is supported.
