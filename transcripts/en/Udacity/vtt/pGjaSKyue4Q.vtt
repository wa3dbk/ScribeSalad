00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.560
So one thing I'd like to show you in the browser

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.460
is we're going to go to Reddit and we're go to reddit.json. So

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.630
this is going to load Reddit's front page expressed in JSON, which is

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.260
something we've implemented on Reddit so computers can, you know, browse Reddit

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.970
and people can write third party software that uses Reddit. And

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.410
so when you add .json to Reddit, you get this wall of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.605
text, which brings us to our next quiz. Okay, in this quiz,

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:25.900
what I've done for you is I have a variable called reddit_front,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.130
which is what I just showed you from the browser, it's reddit

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.930
frontpage expressed in json. Now this is actually quite a lot of

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.800
bit of data look at my scroll bar it's a very long

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.100
line, you not to worry too much about that. Just know that it

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.400
is a string json string of Reddit's front page. Now, what I'd

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.150
like you to do, use the JSON library to parse this string, find

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.300
in there the links. It's kind of a deep data structure. You

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.920
can copy and paste this into, you know, a Python editor if it

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.090
makes it a little bit easier. You need to find the links,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.840
and each link has an ups attribute. And what I want you to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.960
do is write a function called total_ups which returns the total number

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.750
of ups, you know, the sum of all of the ups of all

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.510
of the links in this list. Now, there isn't anything else in

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.140
this list that has ups. So basically, if you can find every instance

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.740
of the key-value pair ups and value, add them all up, and return

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.490
it. I just want to test your ability to load this JSON and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.420
manipulate it a little bit. Okay, good luck.
