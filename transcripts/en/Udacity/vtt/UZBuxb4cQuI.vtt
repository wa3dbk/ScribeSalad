00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.045
We can remove a factor of 5 tenths and 7 tenths from the numerator and the

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:10.065
denominator. 5 tenths divides into 1 and 5 tenths 3 times. And 5 tenths divides

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:15.821
into 2 and 5 tenths 5 times. 7 tenths divides into 4 and 9 tenths 7 times. And

00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:20.395
divides into 2 and 1 tenth 3 times. If you're having trouble with the decimals,

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:25.705
think about multiplying them all by 10. We know 5 goes into 15, 3 times. 5 goes

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:32.560
into 25, 5 times. 7 would go into 21, 3 times. And 7 would go into 49, 7 times.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.551
We don't want to use this since it might confuse us with the powers of 10. But

00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:39.573
it's another way that might help you think about this division.
