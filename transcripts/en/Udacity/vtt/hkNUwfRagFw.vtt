00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.410
We will use classes to build this movie website. Let

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.370
us begin, by recalling what we already know about classes.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.220
Remember the blueprint analogy? Previously, we had compared a blueprint,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.860
to a class. We had said that a blueprint of

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.810
a building, contains information about the building. Like the number

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.840
of rooms in the building. The height and the weight

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.310
of the walls. Now, we can use one blueprint to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.290
build several buildings. And these buildings we call instances or

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.170
examples of that blueprint. Classes are like a

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.210
blueprint. Now we've seen previously that a class

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.890
like Turtle, contains information about what a Turtle

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.040
can do. For instance, move forward, turn right. And

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.530
we use that information to create multiple examples

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.570
or instances of that class. We call them Brad

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.270
and Angie that drew different shapes. In the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.670
same way, we now want to create a class

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.140
called Movie, which will allow us to create

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.030
multiple instances of itself, instances like Toy Story and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.790
Avatar. So then the next big question in front

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.890
of us is. What data should this class Movie

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.010
contain? Now I'm going to present a list of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.540
data points for you, that you can consider. Here

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.510
they are. Which one of the following do you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.690
think the class movie, should remember for each movie?

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.340
Check all of the boxes that you think the class Movie should remember.
