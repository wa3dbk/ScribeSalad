00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.902
The answer is minus four. Strings are sorted alphabetically, so strings that

00:00:03.902 --> 00:00:09.359
start with B, come before strings that start with F. Since badminton comes

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.510
before football, compareTo returns a negative number in this case. compareTo

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.615
could actually have returned any negative integer, and still been correct. But

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:22.080
the way that compareTo is implemented for Strings, happens to return minus

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.120
four.
