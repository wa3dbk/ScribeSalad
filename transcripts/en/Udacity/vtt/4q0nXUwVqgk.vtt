00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
We started out with a brute force algorithm,

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.640
and the brute force algorithm basically considered 2 to the power of N assignments.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.510
Now let's look at our smart search tree or intelligent search tree

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.379
and see how that is structured.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.320
We're going to do a worst case analysis here.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.360
We start out with a graph where we don't have any assignments,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.760
and then we branch into 3 different possibilities.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.660
Up here we don't know anything, so we have 0 vertices assigned.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.340
Now, since we know that we can construct it

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.150
so that in the next level we will have at least 2 more vertices assigned,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.240
here we know that we have at least 2 vertices assigned.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.970
We can go 1 level deeper and again we will branch into 3 possibilities all of the time.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.110
Because we're doing a worst case analysis, of course we could already be done.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.860
Or let's say we just continue.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.480
In the next level we have again at least 2 more,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.150
so we have at least 4 vertices assigned and so on.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.250
So let's say we continue the search tree in this manner,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.290
so we will always get wider and wider and wider.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.010
Then we know 2 things.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.220
One is that the number of levels that we have can be, at most, N/2

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.190
because every time we assign at least 2 vertices.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.940
So N and a half levels is the maximum number of levels that we can have

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.700
because after that, all vertices have been assigned.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.030
And another thing that we know is that while we start out with 1 possibility

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.760
and each time we go 1 level deeper, again doing a worse case analysis here,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.120
the number of possibilities that we consider triples.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.220
The tree basically gets wider by a factor of 3.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.460
The width is times 3 at each level.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.610
My question for you is if you look at the lowest level of the search tree,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.930
each of these ones down here is an assignment of 0 and 1 to the vertices.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.070
What I would like you to think about is how many different assignments

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.500
do we have at this level down here, level N/2?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.050
You can assume for simplicity that N is an even number, so N/2 will be some integer.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.650
I'll give you a number of choices.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.430
Is it 2 to the power of N assignments that we have down here?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.330
Is it 3 to the power of N/2 assignments that we have down here?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.540
Is it 3 to the power of N? Is it 2 to the power of 3 times N?

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.010
Or is it 2 to the power of N/2 times 3?

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.000
You might have to think about this for a little bit,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.070
but just keep in mind the facts.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.220
The number of assignments that we are considering triples at each level,

00:02:27.220 --> 99:59:59.000
and we have N and a half levels.
