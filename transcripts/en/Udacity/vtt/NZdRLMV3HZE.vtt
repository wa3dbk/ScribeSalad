00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
With the first one, the units of measurement would be okay for a rate of change of tons per year.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you look at this first expression, you see that it's not doing what it supposed to be doing.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Actually we are still multiplying the current amount of fish by 0.5 per year

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but still the same growth rate all of the time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The second term 0.5 per year times minus 10⁶ tons

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is just similar to harvesting a huge the amount of harvesting--this cannot be the solution.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The third option doesn't work because the unit of measurement are wrong.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Tons times tons divided by year, tons squared per year. That's not what we want to have.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The second one is the one that works.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The initial rate of change that's 0.5 per year is multiplied by a factor that's 1

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if the amount of fish is 0--1 minus 0 over something and is multiplied by 0

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
if that amount is 10⁶ tons 1 minus 10⁶ tons/10⁶ tons.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This factor modifies the initial rate of change in the way that we need it

00:01:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and here of course, we don't have harvesting.
