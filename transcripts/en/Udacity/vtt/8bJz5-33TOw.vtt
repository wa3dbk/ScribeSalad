00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.022
One of the things that people often
do is they'll create a DevOps team.

00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:10.679
So suddenly you have a DevOps engineer,
or multiple.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.710
And they're like.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.600
What do we do?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.980
Well I read in the in-flight magazine,
that we need to do the Dev Ops.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.200
So I went out and
I hired to DevOps team.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.900
They're going to solve
our DevOps problems.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.350
And that team shows up.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.950
And the rest of the organization
knows where the pain is.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.107
They know how they can how
it came to be in many cases.

00:00:31.107 --> 00:00:35.418
And they have ideas about where
they want to try to create value.

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:38.526
And then suddenly someone shows up and
they're preordained.

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:39.828
You're the Neo.

00:00:39.828 --> 00:00:40.420
You're the one.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.770
You're going to be here,
you're going to fix it, right?

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.120
And that narrative is
a terrible narrative.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.920
So that's the anti-pattern.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.990
Now the language is all of the people
who have been living with the problem

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.550
are somehow not suited to solve it.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.040
And for sure, that's a bad message.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.802
Right.
It will create structures that will not

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.077
serve to get the value that you want.

00:01:03.077 --> 00:01:05.144
So if you find yourself
in that situation.

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:06.624
Where you have completed the class.

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:07.944
You have all these skills.

00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:10.400
And then you find yourself in
an organization, where they're like.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.255
Okay little devils bunny.

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:14.710
Go make everything better.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.679
The first thing that you want to
do is you want to speak back to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.548
the organization and say.

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:24.599
That's not a thing I can do,
but here are things I can do.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:26.837
I can partner with your developers.

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:30.730
I can partner with
your operations teams.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.650
There are skills that we can train.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.520
There our capabilities we can
bring into the organization.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.110
But the first thing I need to know is.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.760
Where does it hurt?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.140
And how can I help?
