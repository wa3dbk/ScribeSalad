I want you to change the particle demo a little. Instead of 8,000 particles

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:08.125
placed at random, I want you to create 9,261 particles in a highly structured

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:13.094
grid. Rewrite the point generation part of the code to place a particle at

00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:16.870
every point in a 2,000 by 2,000 by 2,000 unit grid centered around the origin,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.344
spaced 100 units apart. In other words, you'll want to a point at x, y, z

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:26.439
equals negative 1,000, negative 1,000, negative 1,000, x, y, z negative 900,

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.408
1,000, 1,000 and so on throughout the grid in all directions up to point x, y,

00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:37.410
z 1,000, 1,000, 1,000. There are 21 points you'll place along any given axis.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.140
This should add up to 9,261 points, which is 21 times 21 times 21. When you're

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.850
done you should see this on the screen. I've turned the background color to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.680
gray so that it's easier to see the particles themselves.
