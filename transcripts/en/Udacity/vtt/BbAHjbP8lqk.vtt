00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.375
What I notice when I first look at this problem, is that both sides of the

00:00:03.387 --> 00:00:07.000
equation are divisible by 4. Now obviously, we divide the right side by 4, it's

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:10.550
going to make things easier, since it's just getting rid of this coefficient.

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:12.900
But this is also convenient to do on the left side.
