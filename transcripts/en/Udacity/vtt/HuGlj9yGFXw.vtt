00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.360
The next step in our plan is to check

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.710
the text that we've read thus far for profanity. Now,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.310
to do this, I searched the Internet and found

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.010
this website called wdyl.com or what do you love. This

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.430
website was developed by Google and one of the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.870
things it does is that it can tell us if

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.060
a word is a curse word or not. So,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.500
if I go to this website's profanity link, which is

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.030
profanity question mark q, by the way, this

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.180
link is also available in the instructor notes

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.920
and try out the word shot, S-H-O-T and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.590
see what happens. ha, the website's response is false

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.750
which means that this word, the word shot, is not a curse word. But if I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.890
change this word by just one letter and

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.770
hit Enter. The response is a little bit different.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.170
I can even give this website a sentence or a paragraph. So let me, in place of

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.890
saying one word, say, I can take a shot at it and hit

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.200
Enter, and the response is false, which means that this sentence is fine. But,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.300
if I change one word in that sentence, so I will say, I can, well, you know,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.910
and then hit Enter. Ooh, the response now is

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.740
true, which means that there is a curse word

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.380
in this sentence. [SOUND] All we have to do

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.690
now is do what we've been doing, but using code.
