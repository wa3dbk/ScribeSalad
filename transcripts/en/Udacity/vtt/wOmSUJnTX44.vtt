00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.791
When we factor a number, we split up the number into the product of other

00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:10.061
numbers. 216 can be written as 2 times 108. This number is even, so I know I can

00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:15.258
divide by 2. Then I just continue my process to get all the other factors. 108

00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:20.061
breaks down into 2 times 54, and 54 breaks down into 2 times 27. 27 isn't

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:25.264
divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3. So we have 3 times 9 is 27 and then 9

00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:30.690
is 3 times 3. These factors are the prime factors, because the numbers only have

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.770
two distinct factors, 1 and itself. The only factor of 2 is 2 and 1, and the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.872
only factor of 3 is 3 and 1. We can rewrite 216 using bases and exponents. We

00:00:40.872 --> 00:00:46.111
know we have 2 to the third power, since we have 3 2's. And we have three to the

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:50.530
third power since we have three 3s. This is the prime factorization for 216,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.937
since the only numbers that appear here are prime factors. Use what you know

00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:59.467
about prime factors to figure out what's the prime factorization for 192. You

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:03.883
can write your answer in this box and be sure to include the appropriate bases

00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:04.843
and exponents.
