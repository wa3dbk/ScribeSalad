00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.300
So now that we have an idea
of we might use this data

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.880
let's actually build the maze
from our PList and our JSON file.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.110
Now before we do that if we
go back to our PList file I

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.920
want to make sure everyone
notices that the root of this

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.230
PList file is a dictionary
instead of an array.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.760
And this is also true of the JSON
file because the first and the last

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.710
characters are these curly braces,
which are indicative of an JSON object,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.990
and a JSON object can be converted quite
easily into a dictionary and SWIFT.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.000
Now the first thing we've done is to
find this enum called MazeCellDirection.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.470
The most important thing about this enum
is that's it's raw type is of Int, and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.650
what this thing is going to allow us
to do is it's giving us values 0 and

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.230
now it's going to be 1, 2, and 3, and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.980
these will map to the indexes
in these boolean arrays.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
So instead of having to refer
to the first element as the 0th

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.250
element we can use easier to read names
like top, right, bottom and left.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.990
So this is a little trick
that I've used many of times.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.430
I'd recommend you to try it yourself.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.402
Then as we said both in the PList and

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.060
the JSON file these
things are dictionaries.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.640
So we're going to start with
a function that contains a dictionary,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.690
and we're going to return a string, and
the string we're going to return is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.580
going to be really, really long, but
it's going to be what allows us to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.410
visualize it here as opposed to how we
visualized it in the actual maze app.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.490
The first thing we want to do is
make sure that the keys exist.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.030
So we need to have a rowCount,
a columnCount, and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.540
cellData, and if we have all of those
key value pairs, then let's make

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.750
our maze string a really, really
long string representing the maze.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.380
Now this function here
the makeMazeString function

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.580
is where all the magic happens.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.040
First thing we do is initialize a string
called finalstring to the empty string,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.650
and then what we're going to do
is we're going to loop through

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.500
row by row to create our string.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.210
So imagine here that we're looking at
the first row, and for each row we're

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.100
going to pass through the column data
three times, and I'll show you why.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.050
The first time we're going to create
the top section of the string.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.860
So that's created the top section
of this first row of grid cells.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.980
The second time we go through the
columns we're going to create the middle

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.660
section, and there's our middle
section for this row of grid cells,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.340
and then the third time we'll
create the bottom section.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.790
And so for each pass that we're making
we're appending to the string, and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.240
when we get to the end of a section
to get to the new line here you'll

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.390
notice that back in the code
we're adding a new line.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.250
So let's look at that now.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.810
And there you can see.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.070
So this is our first pass,
then our new line, our second pass,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.640
another new line, and then our
third pass, and the final new line.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.670
Now you may have noticed the special
case where if the row is one and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.970
the column is 0 we're going to
insert this little star icon for

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.540
the middle section, and we'll see what
that looks like in just a second.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.510
And the reason we did this is mainly for
show.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.160
We just wanted to more closely mimics
one of the mazes from the maze app.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.440
Now these next two functions make top or
bottom section, and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.530
make middle section they're what
actually looks at the array of bools and

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.630
determines which kind of
string we want to append.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.880
So is it a string that contained walls,
or

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.380
a string that doesn't contain any walls.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.100
Then when we finally make it to the
bottom here we can create our maze in

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.670
three lines of code.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.710
Not a bad day's work.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.060
So this looks similar to what we saw for
the student's PList example.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.450
We're creating the path to Maze1.PList,
and then we're loading this into

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.210
a dictionary instead of an array,
and then we call our function

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.770
VisualizeMaze with the dictionary
that we've loaded from the PList.
