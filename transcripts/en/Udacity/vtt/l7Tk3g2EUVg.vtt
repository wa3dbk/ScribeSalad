00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.730
Here's a simple example of
misuse detection approach.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.390
The IDS matches the observer activities
using a set of text signatures or

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.130
patterns.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.100
If there's a match,
the IDS outputs an alert.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.740
For example, here is the signature
of the so called land attack.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.315
That is, the source IP,
it's the same as destination IP and

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:28.530
the source port is the same
as destination port.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.630
A machine that received
this packet may crash.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.330
Again, such a simple approach
cannot detect new attacks

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.050
because they don't have signatures.
