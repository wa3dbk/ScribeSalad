00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.390
The easiest way to get started with
Kubernetes is to use a Kubes detail

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.680
run and command.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.401
Let's use a Kubes detail run and

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:09.669
command to launch a single
instance of the nginx container.

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.921
As you can see, Kubernetes has
created what is called a deployment.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.574
We'll explain more about
deployments later, but for now,

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:18.123
all you need to know is that
deployments keep our pods up and

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:21.000
running even when
the nodes they run on fail.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.890
In Kubernetes, all containers
run in what's called a pod.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.340
Use the kubectl get pods command,
to view the running nginx container.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.200
Now that the nginx container is running,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.040
we can expose it outside of Kubernetes
using the kubectl expose command.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.890
So what just happened?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.040
Behind the scenes, Kubernetes created an
external load balancer with a public IP

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.640
address attached to it.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.350
Any client who hits that public IP
address will be routed to the pods

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.810
behind the service.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.410
In this case,
that would be the nginx pod.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.840
So if we list our services now,
we'll see that we have

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.240
a public IP that we can use to
hit the nginx container remotely.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.370
And there you go.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.250
Kubernetes supports an easy to
use workflow out of the box using

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.200
the kubectl run and expose commands.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.940
Now that you've seen
a quick tour of Kubernetes,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.680
it's time to dive into each of
the components and abstractions.
