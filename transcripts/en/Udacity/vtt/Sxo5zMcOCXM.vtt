00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.858
Android 1.0 launched in 2008. And in just the six year since then,

00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:09.880
there has been 11 new major platform releases. On the Android developer side,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.460
we show the relative number of active Android devices running a given platform

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.314
version in this pie chart, because pie charts are awesome. For our purposes

00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:22.700
though, you're really better off looking at this as a histogram. If you squint,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.715
you can almost see a vaguely bell-shaped curve, with the oldest releases here at

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:31.858
the left, their popularity dropping off as devices are upgraded or

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:36.100
replaced. The largest proportion of devices are here in the middle,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.020
representing devices about two years old. And the newest platforms,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.470
gaining popularity as new phones are released or upgrades go out,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.523
are here on the right. So with that in mind, the Min SDK acts as your low-pass

00:00:47.523 --> 00:00:51.980
filter. Google Play won't show your app on devices running a platform version

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.660
lower than its minimum SDK version. So why not just set the Min SDK to one and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.400
support everyone? Generally, you'll want to target as many users as you can, but

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.040
there's a cost associated with supporting some of these older versions.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.830
Things like creating different execution paths around deprecated or

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.730
update APIs or presenting a different UX to devices with different features. So

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.360
you need to balance the opportunity of expanding your audience with the cost of

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.480
supporting those new users. Also, remember that each release introduced with it

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.900
new APIs and hardware support. So it may not make sense to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.190
make your app available to devices that don't support your minimum feature set.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.430
By comparison, the Target SDK is not a high-pass filter.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.460
It's used only to declare which platform version you've tested on.

00:01:37.628 --> 00:01:41.060
An app targeted to a certain API will continue to be forward compatible on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.650
future releases. The platform uses the Target SDK values in case a future

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.040
platform makes a significant change to expected behavior. This ensures your app

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.620
doesn't break when a user's phone gets upgraded. If you're developing a new app,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.630
there's really no reason to target anything but the latest Android version. And

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.340
once your app has been released, make it a point to update your Target SDK and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.610
test as soon as possible when new platform releases roll out so you can take

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.570
advantage of every new platform optimization and improvement it has to offer.
