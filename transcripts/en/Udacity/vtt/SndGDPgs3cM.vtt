00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.788
Through of the constant term from being on the right-hand side to being on the

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:07.315
left-hand side, we usually need to add 3 to both sides. This gives us an

00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:11.996
equation of y plus 3 equals x squared. So, in other words, if you want to shift

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:17.216
to the problem y equals x squared down by 3 units, we just need to replace y

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:18.266
with y plus 3.
