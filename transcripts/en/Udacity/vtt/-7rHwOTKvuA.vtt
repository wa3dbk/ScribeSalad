I'd like to take a minute to give you a
visual of why the distributive property

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.317
works the way that it works. So, let's go
back to drawing our beautiful circles. So

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:13.129
let's say we have a group of 2 circles
and also a group of 10 circles. And,

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.744
according to this equation, what we're
going to want to do is both add them

00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:20.844
together and then triple them. So if we
were to solve this problem the first way

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:24.627
that we talked about, we would do this
addition inside the parentheses first, and

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:28.449
then our multiplication. So you would take
these two groups, the 2 and the 10

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.655
circles, and merge them into one group.
Great. So now we have 12 circles in one

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:38.212
big group. And then, the next thing I want
to do is multiply this group by 3, so

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:42.541
that means we want 3 sets of this
group of circles. So right now, we have

00:00:42.553 --> 00:00:46.945
one set and I can add 1 more, which make
it 2 sets and then I can add a third

00:00:46.957 --> 00:00:51.253
one. Remember, multiplication is just
repeated addition. So now, I have 3

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.415
groups of these 12 circles together and
that's it. I can count these up and if I

00:00:55.427 --> 00:00:59.552
decide, I'd do that right now, which I
won't, because I'm lazy, we would see that

00:00:59.564 --> 00:01:03.714
we have 36 circles. Okay, great. So,
that's the first method for solving this

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:07.737
problem. However, we also have that 2nd 
method of solving problems like this and

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:11.272
that's using the distributive property. So
if we want to use the distributive

00:01:11.284 --> 00:01:15.717
property, then the first step is going to
be to multiply each of the terms that's

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.400
inside the parentheses by the 3. So
let's write down method 2. First, we're

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:23.651
going to say 3 times 2, then we're going to add
that to 3 times 10, just like we saw in the last

00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:27.374
quiz. Starting with the group of two
circles, I wanted to triple this like we

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:31.266
see in this 1st term. And then, as we
see in the 2nd term, I want to triple

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:35.395
this group as well. Great. So now I have
two groups, one group of 6 circles which

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:38.029
is 3 times 2, and one group of 30 circles which
is 3 times 10.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.938
And then, I want to add those two groups
together. So we need to merge this set of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.159
circles with this set of circles, and we
end up with the exact same picture that we

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:50.492
got using the first method. Once again, we
have 36 circles all in one group. I hope

00:01:50.504 --> 00:01:54.793
this has given you some insight into why
we're allowed to distribute multiplication

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.636
to terms that are added together inside a
parentheses.
