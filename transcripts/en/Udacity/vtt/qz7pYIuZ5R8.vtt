00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.890
Design is all about making decisions. Generally trading off among nonfunctional

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.530
criteria. There are various sources that can inform these decisions.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
Such as the customer, the end user, technology specifications, and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.860
competitor's products. Sometimes however, a more detailed analysis is required.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.040
Examples of such devices include simulations, prototypes, and the topic for

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.550
today, design studies.
