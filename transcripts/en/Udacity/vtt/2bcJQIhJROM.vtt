00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.500
Whenever we write an equation in this form, we say that it is in slope-intercept

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.742
form. We say that, because we can read the slope and the y intercept or the b

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:13.240
directly from the equation. Let's try putting this knowledge to use. Which of

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.772
the following equations are in slope-intercept form? A word of warning. This is

00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:22.083
pretty tricky, but, I really want you to think about this. So, take your time

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:23.679
and then go with the answer.
