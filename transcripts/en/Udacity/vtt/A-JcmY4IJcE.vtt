Another thing that I wanted to mention
before we dive into the code

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.750
is that it's important to be 
a good Android citizen.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.756
This means adhering to the principle 
of minimizing network activity

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:15.117
and having an app that works seamlessly
between offline and online states.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.950
We're going to make that happen 
by creating a cache data model

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.255
that is shared between 
the various activities of Sunshine.
