The other thing I've introduced here is Named Arguments. The way we've called

00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:07.800
functions so far, we just pass in a list to values and they automatically get

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.832
matched up one by one with the names of the parameters of the function that was

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:15.594
defined that we're calling. If we want we can optionally put the names in

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:19.311
ourselves and this looks really like an assignment and that's sort of what it

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.072
is. We're passing in arg1 that means we're assigning the value to param1 here to

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:27.123
whatever this evaluates to. We'll see having Named Arguments like this becomes

00:00:27.123 --> 00:00:30.994
very useful when we define functions with lots of arguments. Some of which might

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:31.503
be optional.
