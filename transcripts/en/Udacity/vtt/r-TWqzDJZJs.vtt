00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.185
If we decide that the beverage is fine to drink now, that means we're accepting

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:08.950
the null hypothesis. However the beverage is actually too hot and you burn your

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.711
tongue. So the state of the world, or reality, is that the beverage is too hot.

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:19.166
Therefore we've committed a type II error. If we decide that the beverage is

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:23.874
fine to drink now and indeed it is. Then we accepted the null hypotheses and

00:00:23.874 --> 00:00:28.481
the null is actually true. So we made the correct decision. If you think the

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:32.837
beverage is too hot. That means you're agreeing with the alternative

00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:38.000
hypotheses. But if it's actually fine now, in other words the null is true.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.948
Then we're committing a type I error. And finally, you think the beverage is

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:47.734
too hot, so you accept the alternative. And indeed, the alternative is true.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:52.583
Or, H0 is false. So we made the correct decision.
