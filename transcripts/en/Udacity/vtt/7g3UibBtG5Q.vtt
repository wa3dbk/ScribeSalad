There are many different modes of raps such as gangsta rap, nerdcore hiphop,

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.650
and crunk. I mean there are three main ways within WebGL of repeating a

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.830
texture. These are called wrap modes. Here's a demo showing them in action. The

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.250
repeat mode is the one you're most likely to use. It simply repeats a texture

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.420
one after another. If you want to have things look continuous, such as water,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.255
then the texture itself needs to be what is called seamless, where its edges

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:28.260
match up. If your texture is not seamless, one cheap way to tile it across the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.360
plane is to set the wrap mode to be mirrored repeat. This concrete texture is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.932
not seamless. I just grabbed a piece of an image on Wikimedia Commons. With

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:41.892
mirrored repeat on, the texture flips on each repetition. This is a bit easier

00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:45.849
to see with the r texture. This wrap mode is not a great solution. It's often

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:49.120
clear that the texture is being flipped in this way. Still, it's better than

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.570
nothing. The third wrap mode is called clamp to edge. The drawback or feature

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.010
of this mode is that the pixels on the edge are used to fill in the area where

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.060
the texture does not appear. This is the default mode for wrapping, as it has

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.310
some advantages for filtering along the edges when the texture is not going to

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.430
be repeated. This code shows how to set each of the three wrap modes in 3JS.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.001
The s and t axes essentially mean the u and v axes. You can in fact mix and

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:18.242
match these modes, repeating on one axis and clamping on the other. Now give

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:19.710
the demo a try yourself.
