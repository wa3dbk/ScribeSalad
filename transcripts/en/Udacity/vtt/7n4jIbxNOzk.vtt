00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.477
We learn how to multiply radicals using the product rule. Whenever we have the

00:00:04.477 --> 00:00:09.480
same index, we can simply multiply the radicals together. We can't multiply

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.576
square roots and cube roots together but we could multiply fourth roots and

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:17.422
fourth roots together since the indexes would match. let's dive deeper into

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:21.708
multiplying radicals and see if you can get some of these correct. See if you

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:25.292
can multiply each pair of roots here together and then simplify the answer if

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.333
possible. Try your best on these.
