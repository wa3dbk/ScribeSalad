00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.680
Once we've got our histogram,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.990
there are a lot of statistics we
can run on it to characterize it.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.540
For instance, of course we might
be interested in the mean.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.890
We might also be interested
in the standard deviation.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.090
Which is essentially on average how far

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.710
do individual measurements
deviate from the mean.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.640
Another very important measure
is something called Kurtosis.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.040
Kurtosis comes from a Greek word
that means curved or arching.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.470
So what does Kurtosis mean?

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.940
Well let me show you.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.760
Kurtosis tells us about
the tails of the distribution.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.380
So the tails are the parts
out here towards the ends.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.040
And if we assume that our
distribution is similar to

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.580
a Gaussian distribution,
or normal distribution.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.810
The measure of kurtosis
tells us how much

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.140
different our histogram isfrom that
traditional Gaussian distribution.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.160
So in this case we have
what are called fat tails.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.890
We got them over here and over here.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.940
What that means is that
there are occasional,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.200
and more frequent than would happen if
we had a regular Gaussian distribution.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.070
There are frequently large

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.900
excursions more frequently than if
this was a normal distribution.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.660
If you were to measure
the kurtosis of this histogram,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.920
you would get a positive number.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.840
Meaning that there are more
occurrences out in these tails.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.150
Than would be expected if it
were a normal distribution.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.010
If you measured a negative kurtosis.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.240
It would mean that there are many fewer
occurrences out here on the tails.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.830
Than would be expected if it
were a normal distribution.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.030
So we can plot our data in this sort
of bar chart called a histogram.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.770
We can measure statistics on it like
standard deviation, mean and kurtosis.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.560
And remember the following
about kurtosis.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.880
If we’ve got a positive kurtosis,
that means we’ve got fat tails,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.230
like in this example.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.160
There’s more occurrences
outside in the tails

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.190
than would normally happen
with a Gaussian distribution.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.850
And if we’ve got a negative kurtosis,
we’ve got skinny tails,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.280
meaning there’s less out there.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.170
Now, I’m going to hand it over to Dave,
and she’s going to show you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.080
how to make this plot and
calculate these numbers in Python.
