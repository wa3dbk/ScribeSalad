00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.989
Quaternions represent the orientation of an object, how it's rotated. They can

00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:08.546
do the same thing as axis angle rotations. They rotate a model around a given

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:11.946
axis by an angle. They get a lot of use in animation because you can easily

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:16.247
interpolate between one orientation and another. Think of two vectors poking

00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:19.444
through a sphere at the origin. If you want to change your orientation and go

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:23.432
from one vector to the other, there are a number of ways you can do it. Say you

00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:27.000
want to do this over four frames. You can't normally do this well with Euler

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.400
angles. The change in direction is likely to need more than one Euler angle

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.500
changed at a time. Changing two Euler angles at once can give you problems with

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.210
Gimbal lock, as one angle is applied before the other. Euler angles are

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.660
terrible for interpolation around an arbitrary axis, especially when the change

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.432
is large. Using an axis angle scheme, you would go a quarter of the angle and

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:50.082
form the matrix. Every frame would need to form a new matrix, which can get

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:54.005
pricey. Creating each takes a number of trigonometric function calls.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.038
Quaternions are a third solution. You can set quaternions to perform the same

00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:01.750
interpolation in a clean way and in a form as compact as Axis-angle - just four

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.985
values. No trigonometry calls are needed. Quaternions themselves are fairly

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:10.165
non-intuitive as to what their four numbers mean in physical terms when

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:14.226
compared to Axis-angle. However, just like you rarely look at a single number

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:17.130
in, say, a rotation matrix, the meaning of the Quaternion's individual values

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.996
doesn't really matter when you're using them. When you interpolate around an

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:26.421
axis, it's called a SLERP, short for spherical linear interpolation. All this

00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.173
means is that you're moving from one point on the sphere to another in a direct

00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:33.895
and linear fashion. 3JS and many other packages support quaternions because of

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:38.790
the simplicity. In 3JS, if you wanted to use angle axis rotations, you'd also

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.715
have to maintain your own translation and scale matrices for the object being

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:46.364
rotated. Because quaternions are fully supported as a separate interpolation

00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:49.876
system. You can enable these in 3JS, while still using the position and scale

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:54.555
parameters. Quaternions make it easy to specify and interpolate between various

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:58.570
orientations. Similar to rotation matrices, but with less values involved, you

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.931
can also multiply quaternions together. Doing so produces a new quaternion that

00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.463
is a result of this series of rotations. Quaternions are often used for

00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:11.500
animation paths or flying controls. In fact, 3GS uses them for just that class,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.440
FlyControls.js. That said, you do have to be careful in using quaternions with

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.080
cameras, in that the up vector will not be maintained throughout the SLERP, and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.964
you'll need to reorient. Try the demo that follows. It moves the bird's hat

00:02:22.964 --> 00:02:26.920
back and forth on its head in a jaunty way. You can choose to interpolate using

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.280
Euler angles or quaternions. With Euler angles on, try setting the angles to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.324
their maximums. If you look from above, you'll see that the path is not

00:02:34.324 --> 00:02:37.340
straight around the head but rather takes an s-shaped curve.
