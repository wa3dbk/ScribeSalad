00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.621
Well, what do you think? Which of the
following could be a plausible explanation

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:08.764
for Friedman's observation, and which
would lend for a different policy

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:13.033
conclusion? One option is this is
completely plausible. McDonald's makes

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:17.692
people happy and happy people don't go to
war, or maybe countries with McDonald's

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:22.187
spent too much of their money in order to
open the McDonald's and now they can't

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.931
afford to go to war. Or maybe citizens of
countries with McDonald's are too

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:31.460
unhealthy to go to war. Or maybe countries
with McDonald's are more open to

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:36.567
globalization and foreign investments and
less inclined to go to war with other such

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.488
open countries.
