00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.814
A hallmark pattern of material design
is using a floating action button or

00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:06.510
F-A-B, FAB.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.880
This is a vibrant-colored
circular icon button

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.670
that floats above the rest
of your content in your app.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.800
And it's a way of promoting
a prominent action and

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.170
of communicating
the character of a screen.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.990
As this button floats in
front of other content,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.390
it's always easily accessible and
communicates its importance.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.580
While it floats above content, and
generally has the highest elevation of

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.230
all views, it can still respond to
changes in other parts of your UI.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.775
For example, scrolling with
the content or repositioning.

00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:39.540
FABs have standard sizes and
elevations, so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.360
that they are recognizable
across applications.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.070
They come in either 40 or
56dp diameters and

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.600
generally have a resting elevation
of 6dp, rising to 12dp when pressed.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.730
While they can be positioned
where ever makes sense for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.690
your interface,
they tend to sit well on seams and

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.110
steps where two surfaces meet or
anchored to an appropriate corner.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.840
Just as the FAB is a great way to direct
attention, you should be careful not to

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.510
overuse it everywhere in your app,
and only use a single FAB per screen.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.710
Not every screen needs a FAB, but if
there is one clear action on the screen

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.750
then it's a great way to promote it.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.930
If you're struggling to identify
which action should be a FAB

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.890
then it's a good sign that you probably
don't need one on that screen.
