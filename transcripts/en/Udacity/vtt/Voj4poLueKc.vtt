00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.952
So we know, this is the fourth power. 3 to the 4th equals 81. And this form is

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:10.850
considered to be exponential form. Now, another new form that we're going to

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.775
talk about is logarithmic form. Log form involves a logarithm, and it's just

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:21.178
another way of writing this equation. The key idea for a logarithm is that its

00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:27.132
base will be the same base in the equation above. So if we have 3 to the fourth

00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:35.592
equals 81, then we'll have log with a base of 3 set equal to 4. The answer to a

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:41.402
logarithm is an exponent. Meaning if I take the log base 3 of some number, I'll

00:00:41.402 --> 00:00:47.372
get 4. Now it turns out that that number has to be 81. So we read this

00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:53.830
statement as log base 3 of 81 equals 4. We're asking ourselves, what's the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.825
exponent that we need to raise a base of 3 to, to get 81? Well, that exponent

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:05.670
is 4. When we take the logarithm of any number, we'll always get an exponent.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.561
We use logarithms as a way to undo or reverse raising a number to a power. For

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:15.209
example, if we had this exponential form, we can also write it in logarithmic

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:21.520
form. This base becomes the base of our logarithm. So, we'll have log base two

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.795
of sum number equals 3, the exponent. We know that this number must be 8, since

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:34.115
2 raised to the third power equals 8. The log base 2 of 8 is the exponent that

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:40.245
we need to raise 2 to in order to get 8. So, in this case, log base 2 of 8

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:45.890
equals 3. In general, when we have something written in exponential form with a

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.190
base raised to an exponent equal to a number, we can rewrite this in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.347
logarithmic form. We can make the base be the base of our logarithm, the number

00:01:55.347 --> 00:02:01.662
is the argument for a logarithm and the answer is the exponent. So log with

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:07.316
base b of some number always will give us an exponent. I think the key idea in

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:13.467
any of these situations is that the log of a number results in an exponent. The

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.040
same was true for this example.
