00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.940
I'd like to talk about some advanced cache updates. Say

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.220
we have this problem where multiple people submit posts to Ascii

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.440
Chan at the same time, or submit to your blog at

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.820
the exact same time. You know, let's say they hit multiple

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.480
app servers, or different app servers. They both write to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.150
the database at the same time, and then they both update

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.230
the cache at the same time. Overwriting each other. This can

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.610
happen. This is a type of race condition where you know,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.940
two updates come in at the same time, and we don't know

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.610
what order to handle them in and they both squawk them, basically one

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.530
tramples the other. If we to draw this in a picture, it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.710
looks something like this. Say we've got two apps servers. Here's an example

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.460
of the problem. And we've got our database. And we've got our

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.710
cache. And say we've got el, elements in our database. We're going to call

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.770
them one and two. And these app servers are both going to get

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.830
requests from the user to, to submit a new entry into our database,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.840
you know, our new piece of art for ASCIIchan. And this

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.530
happens at the same time. So this guy may submit element three.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.970
And this guy may submit element four. So our database is, you

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.910
know, in sync because databases enforce these constraints. You know, you can

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.020
insert as many things as you want at the same time the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.290
database will order it all for you. But here's the problem. Let's

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.290
start with version one of this problem which is. Each of these

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.250
app servers is manipulated in the cache directly. So this guy inserts

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.810
element 3, and so he writes to the cache

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.420
and he says, the database looks like this. And just

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.720
as he does this, this app server finishes inserting item

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.950
4 into the database and he is not communicating with

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.300
this app. He overwrites the cache to instead look like

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.740
this. 1,2,4. Because this app server, remember we're not doing

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.030
another query form the database, we're just manipulating the cache

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.030
direectly. This app server squashed the other app server's update.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.920
That's, that's a problem. Now, let's look at another way this

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.710
problem can ahppen. Say we were using the the first approach

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.890
we talked about where we, when we write to the database

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.340
we immediately do a read from the database and update our

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.610
cache that way. We can still have this problem. First, this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.100
App server inserts element 3 into the data base. And then

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.520
it says okay you know, let's, let's rerun the query, so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.610
we, so we can update the cache. But at the same time,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.890
this other App server Inserts element four into the database, and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.770
it also wants to rerun the query. So, each of these,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.930
you know, has a view of the database. This first app

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.650
server thinks it's 1, 2, 3, and this other guy thinks

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.030
it's 1, 2, 3, 4. Now, there's no guarantee this first

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.000
app server will write to the cache for this one. because,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.250
things can happen out of order. Your app server can have

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.530
a slight delay, you know, there can be a network glitch.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.830
There's going to be any number of reasons why this app server might run.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.480
You know might have a little hiccup and this guy writes you know,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.650
or, or, or this guys gets the right to the cache first. 1,2,3,4.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.402
And this other guy comes in and tramples on top of him. So

00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:48.156
there are a handful of ways where these app servers can you know,

00:02:48.156 --> 00:02:51.012
overwrite each other and if we, if, if we are redirecting the user

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:54.190
to our front page to do the cache update that way. The, the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.480
odds of this happening is even more

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.770
likely because it's not going to happen quite

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.320
so fast, we've gotta go all the way to the user

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.320
and back before we update our cache. So, that's the problem, you

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.489
know, multiple app servers overriding each other in the cache because the

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.780
cache doesn't have any transactions, it doesn't have any of the fancy

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.980
stuff that the data base has. You know on that base we

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.610
juts say insert this element but on the cache we say the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.550
list of elements is this so we can't just answer it at

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.210
the front of it let me introduce one solution to this problem.
