00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.210
No, this is not necessarily true. Look at these 2 people. They slept different

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:12.128
amounts of sleep, 6 hours and 8 hours but got the same temporal memory score

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:13.037
about 70.

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:19.351
Remember our discussion of lurking variables or extraneous factors? We haven't

00:00:19.363 --> 00:00:24.624
taken all of these into account. In other words, we haven't controlled for

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:30.134
lurking variables. Sleep could influence memory, and by this trend, it looks

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:35.669
like it probably does. But, many other factors can also influence memory, and

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:41.164
this varies by person. There's a relationship here between hours slept and

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:46.779
temporal memory score, but that doesn't mean that hours slept causes a higher

00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:52.369
temporal memory score. In other words, correlation does not prove causation.
