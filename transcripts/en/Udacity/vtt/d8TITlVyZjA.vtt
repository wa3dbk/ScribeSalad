00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.330
So let's pick a quadratic inequality to work with. How about x squared is

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.134
greater than 16. That's pretty simple, it seems like something good to start our

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:13.725
with. What I'd like you to start off by doing, is to modify this inequality so

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:18.487
that the only thing on the right hand side is zero. Please write the new version

00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:20.305
of the inequality in this box.
