00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.621
The answer is 2. If we look at this equation and we require that a can't be 0,

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.206
then we'll always have a term with an x to the 2nd power in it. And this will

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:13.640
always be the term with the highest degree. So that means that quadratic

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.848
equations have this degree as well.
