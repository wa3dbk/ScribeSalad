00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
This case here is correct for the following reasons, x₃ is just as it is--there's not a not.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.340
What that means is that if we take the path that signifies x₃ is set to true

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.030
and we know that is the path that goes like this.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.170
Then we want to be able to visit this vertex here by paying so to say

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.110
just one extra edge, so that's exactly this one here.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.230
If we had not x3 here, then this answer here would have been correct.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.960
It seems like this is actually a good idea to show that any Boolean formula can be transformed

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.350
into a graph such that the shortest path between A and B tells us whether the original

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.350
Boolean formula had a satisfying assignment or not, but of course we haven't proved it yet

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.770
and that is why we will now have to go into gory details in order to actually prove

00:00:51.770 --> 99:59:59.000
that we can reduced SAT to shortest tour.
