00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.759
Let's see how we got 4. If we know twice a number added to 7, we know how to

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:09.881
write twice a number. Twice a number means 2 times the number. I'm going to use

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:14.419
n as the variable this time. So if I had 2 times the number, or twice the

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:19.259
number, added to 7 means plus 7. And it's equal to 5 less When I see 5 less,

00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:24.573
that means I'm going to be subtracting 5 from whatever comes after, is equal to

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:29.806
5 less than 5 times the number. So, here we have twice the number added to 7 is

00:00:29.818 --> 00:00:35.042
equal to 5 less than 5 times the number. Now that we've translated our words

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:40.695
into an equation, we can simply solve this equation. First thing I'm going to do

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:46.040
is subtract 2 n from both sides, and I get 7 is equal to 5 n minus 2 n is 3 n

00:00:46.052 --> 00:00:51.435
minus 5. And now, I just add 5 to the both sides and I get 12 is equal to 3 n.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:57.147
Now I have 12 equals 3 n. So all I need to do is divide both sides by 3 and I

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.376
get n is equal to 12 divided by 3, which is 4. That wasn't too bad was it? Let's

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:03.348
try another one.
