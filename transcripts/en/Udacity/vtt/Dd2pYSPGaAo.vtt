00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We studied the special case of a fair coin, p=0.5,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and now I want to do the same thing for our arbitrary p.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It turns out that the real challenge is not to compute the confidence interval.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The real challenge is to compute the variance of a coin flip where the outcome is p.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In particular, let's do a quick check. Suppose p=0, what do you think the variance should be?

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Do this by thinking principally not by trying to solve complex mathematical equations.
