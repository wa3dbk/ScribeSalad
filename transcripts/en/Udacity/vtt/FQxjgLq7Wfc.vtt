00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.850
Now recall from the last lecture, we had looked at the insides of a camera.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.990
The lens assembly.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.670
Light goes in here.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.400
The shutter opens.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.470
Light hits the sensor, which could be the film or a digital sensor.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.530
Only when the shutter is pressed, that's when the mirror pops up.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.600
Otherwise the eye can see through this pentaprism, where what is the scene here.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.250
So, in essence, what happens, is, when somebody presses the shutter,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.330
this op this mirror moves up, the shutter opens, and the light hits the sensor.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.300
So, specifically now, we are going to start looking at is, what is this sensor?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.360
And what constitutes a sensor like this?
