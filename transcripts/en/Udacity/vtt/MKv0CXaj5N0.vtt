I need to edit the person again and I want to add another instance method. This

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.250
method is going to return the string with a friend. So let's return type a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:42.480
string and all it has to do is return the value of friends. Now we can go back

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.990
and if we add Jamesha as a friend to Maria and then we get the friends of

00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:04.040
Maria. It returns Jamesha with a space just like we expected. I can create an

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:14.700
object for TJ as well. Add him as a friend to Maria and then unfriend Jamesha.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.540
And now, if I get Maria's friends again, it just contains TJ. Looks like our

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.940
object is working pretty close to the way we expected. We can now encode a

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.792
social network using our Java program.
