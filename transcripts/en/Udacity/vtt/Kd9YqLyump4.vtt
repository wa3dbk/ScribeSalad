00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.900
You might be wondering how we're going to save the awesome images that we're

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.630
creating inside the canvas.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's go ahead and do that right now.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.020
I'v opened up the HTML document that we've been building,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.420
with this script inside that we're using to control the canvas.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.700
And I've added these two lines here.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.240
In this one, I've created a new variable called saved image, and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.338
I've used this new method, toDataURL.

00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:24.100
I'm calling toDataURL on c, which,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.135
as you may recall, is the canvas object that we grabbed earlier.

00:00:28.135 --> 00:00:31.540
toDataURL, creates a text string that represents the photo.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.830
It can output a couple different image formats, but

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.500
we're only going to use the default for now.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.250
So I've created this new text string representing the image.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.600
And now I'll call window.open on the new save savedimage that we just created.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.820
This should open the new image in a different window.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.550
Let's go ahead, and see if it works.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.210
I will save this and come over to the browser, and refresh, and OK.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.425
It doesn't look like a new window is opening.

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:57.660
Okay, that's kind of weird.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.058
Let's see if we can figure out what's going on here.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.578
Uh-huh.

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:01.760
Okay.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.370
So we're getting an error, which says that tainted canvases may not be exported.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.740
This is an interesting problem.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.330
There are a number of different ways to get around it but basically what it's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.800
saying is that we need to figure out a way of safely hosting and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.960
serving these images in order to save them.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.180
Depending on your browser, you've got a few different options for

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.350
getting around it.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.400
First off in Chrome you can actually just simply right click and hit Save image

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.280
as on whatever you want to save it, which is a really easy way of saving images.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.310
Or you can take an even simpler out which is to simply take a screenshot, and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.020
save your image that way.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.920
But that isn't necessarily what we're going for here.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.280
If you want to actually be able to export these and

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.360
to save them later without right-clicking on them you actually have to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.150
create your own server, running probably on your local machine or online.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.580
And the steps to do so are definitely outside the scope of this course, but

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.710
you can check out some of the links in the instructor notes for

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.200
more details on how to do that yourself.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.245
But for now if you want to save an image using chrome you can just simply

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:07.020
right-click on the image and that should work, or you can take a screenshot or,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.620
you know, if you're feeling ambitious check out the instructor notes to

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.980
learn how to get around this error message here.
