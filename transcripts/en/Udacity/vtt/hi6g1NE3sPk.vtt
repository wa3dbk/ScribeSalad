00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.070
Now, after we've gone through and cleaned our data, we're

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.750
at a place where we need to get the data

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.710
into MongoDB. So, we've looked at queries to MongoDB and

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.970
you've done some exercises. Let's look at inserting documents into

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.600
collections. Now, the database we've been working with all along

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.550
has been the examples database, and we've looked at a

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.780
couple of different collections here. We've looked at the autos

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.900
collection. We've also done some queries against the cities collection.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.180
Now this script that we're looking at here is actually the

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.580
script that I wrote to clean the automobiles data. The way

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.950
that I originally wrote this was that it would simply output

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.410
JSON documents that I could then import into MongoDB. And that's actually

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.680
the, the strategy that I would recommend. But I think it's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.060
also important for you to have an understanding of inserting documents

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.980
Into MongoDB. And so, we'll take this opportunity to show you

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.900
a little bit about how to do that. Now, there's a lot

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.040
about the insert statement that I'm not going to cover

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.880
right here. But, this is the simplest form of using

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.920
insert. Now, what we're going to do is simply loop through

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.420
all of the autos that I've created up here in

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.285
the code. Where I've cleaned the data and essentially created

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:09.196
a dictionary for each auto that needs to be inserted

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:12.630
into a MongoDB collection. Then we're going to simply loop

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.030
through the list of those autos that I've created and call

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.530
the insert statement for each one of them. Passing it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.544
a Python dictionary, PyMongo will translate this into a BSON

00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:28.480
encoding and send it across to the database. Now, what

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.800
I've got here, is I've just got a couple of print

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.380
statements. One that's going to demonstrate how many autos there

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.000
are before we do this series of inserts and one that's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.530
going to show how many there are after. Now to

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.240
do this, I'm using a command we haven't looked at before,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.650
but I'm sure you can figure out what it does. Simply tells us

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.330
how many documents were returned for this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.710
find command. Okay now, let's run this.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.040
Okay. So, what happened was, we went ahead and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.010
inserted all of those documents that we had parsed out

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.030
of the CSV file from DBpedia for autos. Then what

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.730
I did was check the collection, this myautos collection, before

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.060
I did the inserts and got a count of how

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.750
many were in it. There were none. After doing all

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.558
my inserts, I have close to 7800 documents in this,

00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:18.340
myautos collection now. So again, this is an example of

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.770
the insert command in MongoDB, one way of getting documents into the database.
