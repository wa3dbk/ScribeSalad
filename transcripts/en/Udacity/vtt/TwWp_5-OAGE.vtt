00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.328
We looked at positive powers. So let's check out some negative powers. A

00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:09.008
negative exponent tells us to write the reciprocal of a base, and write it with

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.412
a positive power. So here the reciprocal of 3 is 1 3rd and then I write this

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:18.108
with a positive power of 2. This negative sign is kind of like an operation. It

00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:22.968
tells us to write the reciprocal. Of our base. In the second example we need to

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:27.525
be careful, we have 5 times x to the negative 3. The exponent on the 5, is a

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:31.918
positive 1, so we're just going to list the 5 as a factor. Now, we take the

00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:36.418
reciprocal of x, which is 1 over x, and then change the negative power to a

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:41.413
positive 3. For a fraction, we'll take the reciprocal of the base, which is 3

00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:46.841
4ths, and change our negative 2, to a positive 2. We can simplify our answers to

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:51.913
get 1 9th, 5 divided by x cubed, and 9 16ths. Looking back at our work, we can

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:56.737
see that a negative exponent in a numerator moves the factor from the numerator,

00:00:56.737 --> 00:01:01.133
to the denominator. The base of 3 was the numerator, and it ended in the

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:06.240
denominator. The same is true for the x and for the 4.
