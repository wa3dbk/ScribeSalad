00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's time for the final ingredient, combustion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here, we're just looking at one-singled cell at a time. We're treating each cell on its own.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're not looking at the neighbors unlike as we did with diffusion and with winds.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For this singled cell that we're currently looking at,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we have to take two different quantities into account.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The first is the temperature which we already know, it's measured in Kelvin.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The second is the amount of woods that can be burned.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Actually that should be something like a density of wood to be measured in kg/m².

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As the combustion goes on in the cell, this density is reduced possibly to 0

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and in addition we can use this density to model a variation in vegetation.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In a thick forest, the value of this density goes up and at a location

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
at which there's a clearing, the value of this density goes down.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, we have to distinguish between two different cases.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
First, the temperature is below the ignition temperature

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which is something between 500 and 600 K.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Second, the temperature is above the ignition temperature.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Let me put an equal sign in here to really cover all possible cases

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
even though in reality of this temperature, they'll never be exactly equal to that ignition temperature.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When we are below that point of ignition, the amount of wood does not change. It's not burning.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
No heat is being produced because there is no combustion.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Later on of course, the temperature is going to change through diffusion, through wind,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and through heat loss but at the moment, I'm just looking at combustion.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In the second case, we do have combustion.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Wood is burning so the rate of change of wood with respect to time has to be negative.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That's called the burn rate and the simple model for the burn rate

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
would be to say that it's proportional to the current amount of wood.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The more wood we have, the more we burn and we introduce

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a time constant for the burning that's called tB

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The larger this time constant is, the smaller the burn rate is, the less we burn.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This time constant describes so to speak the time it takes to burn a specific amount of wood.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now we have to think about temperature.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In the second case, wood is burning so the temperature should be increasing

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and that should be proportional to that burn rate.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We need some proportionality constant in here versus something like the heating value

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
converting from an amount of wood to an increase in temperature.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
This is our simple model of combustion.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now let's add the effect of heat loss in all equations about the rate of change of the temperature.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We need to include heat loss which is + T amb-T/tHL for that heat loss

00:02:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and the same when there's combustion going on plus Tamb-T/tHL
