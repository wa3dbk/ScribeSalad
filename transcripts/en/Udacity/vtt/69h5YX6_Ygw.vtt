00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.950
Two K S squared is the lowest common denominator, great work if you found it. If

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.300
you're wondering why that's true, it's because these two numbers share a common

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.578
factor of two. Remember these variables are the placeholders of numbers so two

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:16.598
times K would be a number and two time S squared would really be a number as

00:00:16.598 --> 00:00:21.078
well. We don't know what K is, but it's the other factor for this denominator.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.958
And the same is true for s squared. It's the other factor for 2 s squared. We

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:30.507
multiply all these together to get 2 k s squared. Now I know I did a little bit

00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:35.787
of reordering in this situation, but we usually list the coefficient or number

00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:39.243
first. Then we list the variables in alphabetical order.
