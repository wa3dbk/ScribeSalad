00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.455
The Traveling Salesman Problem or

00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:07.100
TSP as it's called, is one of the most
famous problems in computer science.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.169
Envision a graph where all
of the nodes are cities and

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.419
all the edges are roads between them.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.491
TSP asks, what's the fastest way for

00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:21.292
our salesman to travel between
every city and return home?

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:25.500
At its essence,
this is an optimization problem.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.360
When you get rid of the analogy and,
I guess,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.460
the hat, we have a complicated graph and
we're looking for the optimal route.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.780
TSP is used in everything from
microchip design to DNA sequencing.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.260
Let's take a look and see how it's done.
