00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.605
It's time for a quiz to see how well you understand inheritance and adding

00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:07.682
methods to classes. Your goal for this quiz is to find a Discerning bear class

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:11.906
that chases and knocks down trees like a Grizzly Bear, but does not like to eat

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:16.288
humans named Dave. It should behave like this. So we'll create two humans, one

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:20.290
named Dave and one named Bob, and have them both climb trees. And then we'll

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.406
create a Discerning Bear. The Bear can chase Bob, knocks down the tree, yummy,

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:31.522
Bob tastes good. But when the Discerning Bear chases Dave, Kimber[NOISE]. I'm

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:35.830
not eating Dave. So that's the behavior your Discerning Bear should have and

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.513
your goal is to define your Discerning Bear, using as little code as possible.
