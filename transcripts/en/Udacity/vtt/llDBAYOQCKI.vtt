To try to compensate for the higher amount that Grant now has to spend on rent,

00:00:05.068 --> 00:00:10.200
he wants to increase all the possible wiper set prices that he could set by $4.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.276
Before, we represented a potential wiper set price by c, so my question is what

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:20.087
do we need to replace c with now? Instead of charging c dollars for a given

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.803
wiper set, how much should he charge now?
