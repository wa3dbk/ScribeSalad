00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
You may or may not have heard of Godel's Incomplete Theorem,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.890
but since they are also mentioned in conjunction with the Halting Problem

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.810
and undecidability,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.070
it worth saying a few words about them.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.450
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is named Austrian-born mathematician, Kurt Godel,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.350
are concerned with mathematics,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.470
but are actually closely related to undecidability

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.370
and as you might know, any mathematical system starts out

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.320
with a set of axioms.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.020
What are axioms?

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.270
Axioms are statements which you assume to be true

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.659
without having any formal proof of them,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.170
such as if A equals B

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.420
and B equals C, then A must also equal C

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.910
or you can always draw a line from one point to another point,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.570
no matter where they are.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.190
Those would be axioms.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.950
Now axioms often sound very trivial, like this one here

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.800
or the fact that you can always draw a line between 2 points

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.520
but for many of them

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.320
there are actually scenarios where they are not true.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.940
So axioms are the basis of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.370
any mathematical theorem or proof.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.740
Now what Kurt Godel showed, and it was a shocker at his time

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.430
and to many it is still today,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.220
is the following:

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.620
So what Kurt Godel showed was that if you had a set of axioms

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.740
and they don't contradict each other

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.450
and they are listable,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.840
which means you could have an algorithm that lists you all of these axioms,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.820
so either they are finite or

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.070
they can even be infinite as long as you have an algorithm

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.410
that can produce them all; if this is the case,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.700
then there are some statements

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.410
that are true but which you cannot prove

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.880
based on these axioms and this is what he meant by incompleteness

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.300
how he basically showed that

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.660
no matter what foundation you base

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.050
a mathematical system on,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.250
as long as that is a consistent foundation,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.420
then you can not prove everything

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.240
without adding additional axioms at least.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.540
He also showed, and this is the second Incompleteness Theorem,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.270
which is basically an extension of the first one

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.430
that a system of axioms

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.600
cannot not demonstrate its own consistency

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.520
and what that means is that

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.320
very informally,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.480
a mathematical system can not be used to show that

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.730
it itself is consistent.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.280
These 2 statements

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.330
are in a way very similar to the Halting Problem and Undecidability.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.610
The axioms; you can think of those as programming statements.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.090
So any program or algorithm

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.580
is composed of a number of simple instructions

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.350
that are then arranged,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.350
and of course there is an infinite number of possible computer programs

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.580
that you can write, but they are made up of a fine set of building blocks

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.920
and the second Incompleteness Theorem

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.290
is of course very similar to undecidability

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.120
in the sense that it shows that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.910
you cannot use a system to prove everything about that system,

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.160
very loosely speaking,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.000
and the undecidability of the Halting Problem

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.070
and all of the other undecidable problems, of course

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.210
says that we cannot use algorithms

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.550
to calculate everything about algorithms.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.010
I know that from a practical perspective

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.020
there's lots of criticism of this,

00:02:51.020 --> 99:59:59.000
but truth be told, I just find that super fascinating.
