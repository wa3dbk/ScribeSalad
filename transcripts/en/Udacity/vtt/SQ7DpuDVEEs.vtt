00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.019
Now that we have seen all the steps in Tomasulo's algorithm,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.540
let's take a moment and review the whole thing. This is our instruction queue,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.590
our RAT register aliasing table, the registers themselves, and let's say we

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.880
only have the two reservation stations for the add, subtract unit to make

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.040
this more compact. If you look at the steps that happen for one instruction,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.300
here is what we have. We take the instruction from the instruction queue and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.120
issue it to a reservation station and we look up the RAT

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.490
to tell us where the operands for the instruction are going to come from.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.480
Now that the instruction has been issued, it sits in its reservation station and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.050
waits for the operands to actually become ready. During that time,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.740
the instruction is trying to capture the results broadcast by other instructions

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.530
that are executing. Once we have captured the last operant that we were missing,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.290
the instruction will dispatch, which means it is sent for

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.450
execution. And when it's done executing, it writes its result.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.310
Which means, now this instruction will broadcast its result.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.860
This is used by other instructions to capture their missing operands.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.390
This instruction also writes to the register that it is supposed to update,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.660
and it updates the RAT for that register so that future instructions start

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.760
reading the register file and not waiting for this instruction anymore.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.840
What is important to note is that all all of these happen one at a time for

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.040
one instruction every cycle, some instruction may be in one of these steps.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.030
So during a particular cycle, some instruction might be issued. Some

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.260
instructions are trying to capture their operand. Some instructions are trying

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.100
to be dispatched. And finally, some instruction is writing it's result,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.660
and that is the result that is being captured by the instructions that they're

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.640
trying to capture. So all of this activity is happening during every cycle,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.960
it's just that it's happening for different instructions. So you can look at

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.940
each of these steps needs to be taken by a particular instruction, but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.720
the processor doesn't do just an issue of an instruction in a cycle. It's doing

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.060
the issue for that instruction while trying to capture for others while trying

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.990
to dispatch another while doing the write result for yet another instruction.
