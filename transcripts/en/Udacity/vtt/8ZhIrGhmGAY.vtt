00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.850
Now that you've got significant functionality working in

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.220
your application, this would be a good time

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.780
to add some unit tests. In the lesson

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.780
three folder, of the code that you downloaded from

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.370
Udacity's GitHub, you'll find the test folder. This

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.040
folder contains tests that are applicable up to the

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.560
end of lesson three. Basically, tests for the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.111
profile functionality. Probably can't see, but we've got ProfileTest.java,

00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:32.790
we've got ConferenceApiTest.java. So go ahead and copy the test folder into the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.890
SRC source folder where you have your projects, the Conference Central. So you

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.640
can just drag and drop it. There it is. Now I just want you to go ahead

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.170
and delete the target directory in this folder. Whenever you

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.910
run your project, or you run it on Dev Server

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.670
or you deploy it to appspot, the output from the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.830
build all goes into the target directory. And it gets,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.830
it'll get recreated if you delete it. And sometimes the old

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.870
build and the old output files and the new output

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.540
files don't work well together. So, when in doubt, delete

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.310
the target directory. Since we're adding test, we want to make

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.220
sure we're starting with a clean slate. So I'm going to

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.870
delete it, and there it is. Looks like it's

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.000
gone, won't stay gone for long, but it's gone for

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.780
now. Okay. Now let's go to Eclipse. Going to refresh

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.390
the project, since we've added the test directory. And deleted

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.950
the target directory. Okay. So target on, target's still

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.660
there. So whenever you do delete the target directory, it

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.560
actually pretty much automatically gets recreated right away with a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.400
couple of things in it. But it doesn't have everything

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.790
that's needed. Here down in the source directory,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.710
you'll see the test folder now, and it has

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.549
two tests. It has ProfileTest.java in the domain

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.410
package, and it has ConferenceApiTest.java in the SPI packet.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.930
So let's take a look at the tests.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.200
First, I'm going to look at ProfileTest.java. Here we have

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.140
our class ProfileTest. So I'll start by defining

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.680
some values that we're going to need in our tasks.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.080
And we do the setup, and all we're doing this set, for setup here is we create a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.689
new profile and we supply some values. Then we

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.276
have to tear down method, which one we need. And

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:20.440
then here's our first test. We're testing the Getters.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.400
Very simple. Just checking, that the values in the profile

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.280
are in fact values we put in the profile.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.230
Then we check what happens when we update the profile.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.230
So what we're going to do, is update the display

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.040
name and the t-shirt size. And then we want to

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.105
check that the display name is updated, and the

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:42.300
t-shirt size is updated. But in fact, the user ID

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.720
and the email, don't get updated. They need to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.440
remain as they were. And then this other function here

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.040
is commented out, because it tests some functionality that you

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.320
haven't implemented yet, so the test wouldn't work. Now let's

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.700
look at ConferenceApiTest.java. So here we are,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.760
ConferenceApiTest, and again, the first thing we do

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.920
is set up some values for testing on. Have our service helper. Do the setup.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.010
And in this case, the main thing we're doing is creating a new user with

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:21.640
an email, and a user ID. We have the tearDown method. And then we stop testing.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.640
So the first thing we do is testing getting the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.340
profile first time. Now we test saving the profile. Now we

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.710
test saving the profile with null values and, so on. Have

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.050
a look at the different tests that we do, and then

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.540
you get to a point where it's commented out, and that's

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.160
because they're testing functionality you

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.080
haven't implemented. Like, you can't test

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.120
creating a conference, because we haven't written function to create a

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.850
conference here. And as you go through the lesson, you can

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.130
come back into ConferenceApiTest.java. And comment the testing

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.620
functions, as the functions are ready for testing.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.920
Okay. Now we're going to look at running

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.140
the project when we've got tests. So if we

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.670
go up to Conference Central, this time I'm

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.230
going to choose Run As and then Run Configurations. And

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.840
this is my configuration to run the, run

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.742
the Dev Server on localhost. And you see here,

00:04:11.742 --> 00:04:15.990
there is Skip Tests check box. So by default, tests

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.140
are not skipped. It hasn't mattered up until now, because we

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.170
haven't had any tests in there. So it didn't matter

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.590
whether they were skipped or not. But now, the tests will

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.860
be run. If, if at any point you find that

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.940
the tests are blocking you or you want to deploy without

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.290
the test, you can come and click this Skip Tests, but

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.880
let's not do that. Okay. So I'm going to run. Now

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.498
I'm running as per normally see the tests? Okay. My Dev Server is

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:47.420
running. Let me scroll back up and see what the results of the tests were. Okay.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.750
So it run seven tests. There were

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.620
zero failures. Zero errors, zero skipped, and it

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.890
took 0.415 seconds, and then here's the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.750
summary. Okay, good. Okay. We'll that's all fine.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.540
But what happens if you actually do have an error? So to test that, to

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.790
test the tests. Let's introduce an error. So

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.090
since we're testing the profile functionality, I'm going

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.760
to make one of the functions to do

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.060
with profiles return an unexpected result. Okay. So

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.740
we have the getProfile method, and this gets

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.920
the profile associated with the logged in user.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.765
And to get the profile entity out of the

00:05:29.765 --> 00:05:34.030
datastore, we have to first create a key. And

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.713
we specify the class, which is profile.class. And then

00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:39.780
the see it's the key, user ID. But let's

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.040
say we made a mistake, and we put the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.960
user ID inside a string. Which is something that

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.450
does happen. Now, there's no error here. This is

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.250
a valid kind of value here, so. It doesn't

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.670
show me an error. Now let's' see what happens when we run our tests.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.870
Now I'm going to run the project, on localhost. Okay. This time we've

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.870
got an, an error. Failed to execute, and we got an error in the test.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.229
And we got the error in testGetProfile. No huge surprise there.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.880
So, you see we have the stack trace. But at the bottom, we have a nice summary

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.820
where it shows the tests, the gave in error, and how many failures. And now, the

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.330
other thing I want to show you, it's over in your target directory.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.920
May need to refresh your project here. In the target directory, you

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.670
see a folder called surefire-reports.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.970
And this directory contains results of the report.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.380
So if we look at ProfileTest.txt, this is not

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.360
where we had our errors. Zero failures, zero errors.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.210
If we look at ConferenceApiTest.txt, whoo, lots of errors.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.410
But here, failures. There was, there's actually only one

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.500
error, but this is stack trace. But now, if

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.700
we come down, I want you to look at

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.190
the, the, see what happens with the XML files.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.240
If I click on ConferenceApiTest.xml, it'll show me

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.530
the functions that got called, and the ones

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.640
with the error, or the failures. In this

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.710
case here, it takes me straight to where

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:32.520
I had the error. The problem I can see right here is that, is that the user ID

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.390
did not match what was expected. So, I'm going to go ahead now actually and just

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.424
fix my code before I forget. Okay. There's my code

00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:43.660
we'll fix. Now when I run it, I won't get

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.770
any errors. As you continue through the lesson, be sure

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.860
to add the test for the new functionality as you

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.760
implement it. In some cases, you'll need to get the

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.130
test file from the appropriate lesson folders. As you implement

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.680
new endpoint functions, you can simply uncommon the tests that

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.180
are already in Conference API Tests. And if you deviate from

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.530
the code that we have you write, like if you add

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.800
your own functions or you change what the functions do, then you're

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.620
going to need to update the tests and add your own tests

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.140
to make sure that you're testing the functionality that's in your application.
