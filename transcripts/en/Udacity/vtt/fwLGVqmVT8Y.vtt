00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That's a lot about some kinds of specific things we did on Reddit over the years

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that I thought you might find interesting, kind of ways to think about problems.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You guys have throughout this course I think learn the major pieces of how web applications fit together--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
your application servers, your databases, cookies, hashes and how HTTP works

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and with that knowledge, you can build quite a few things.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There are still a few concepts we haven't really talked about.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you're working on your own, that will be good.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
A lot of it revolves around front-end technologies.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
CSS, I have kind of alluded to, and I provided CSS in my examples and things like that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is for controlling how your HTML looks.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So it doesn't look kind of ugly and black and white.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It can be complicated, and it's a little bit of an exact science, laying out a webpage,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but this is a technology worthunderstanding--as well as JavaScript.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
JavaScript is a programming language that runs in the browser.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The web browser shifts this code to the browser and then the browser actually runs it,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and this can manipulate your HTML, it can manipulate your JavaScript,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and it can actually make more requests to your server

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
for small pieces of data and insert those into the page.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Doing that is called AJAX stands for asynchronous JavaScript,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
basically making HTTP calls in the background to your web server to update the page dynamically,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and many, many websites use AJAX now.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
A good example on Reddit is the voting--click that vote, it doesn't reload the whole page or submit a form,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it just sends that vote to the server and then the server records it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
These are some technologies that would good for you guys to learn,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and you can start making your web pages more dynamic, look better, and more interactive.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, there's one last thing we are going to do in this unit,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which is talk to Udacity about how they use Google App Engine in production,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so you can get a sense for troubles they've encountered

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and some of the solutions they found running a large production site on Google App Engine.
