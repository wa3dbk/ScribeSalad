00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.566
If you haven't heard of regular expressions or used them before, then this review is for you.

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:09.232
If you have, feel free to skip to the next video.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:15.332
Let's start by reviewing what you know about finding a substring within a string.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:22.199
Suppose we have a string called S in Python. Now, you may know that we can find a substring within it--

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:34.299
For example, s.find of 'word' will return the position in which the string 'word' occurs within s and return that index if it exists.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.232
So in fact, where it does exist, so it will return that index, 0-1-2-3-4 and so on.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:51.899
It turns out the answer is 21. And if it didn't exist at all, then by convention, it would return -1 to indicate failure,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.866
because -1 is not a valid index.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:59.466
But suppose we aren't looking for exactly one individual word.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:02.366
Suppose there's a whole family of words that we want to find.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:07.732
Take a crazy example: Let's say we're interested in the family of words used by sheep. There's a sheep.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:16.599
And what do they say? Well, the sheep can say, "Baa!" or "baaaa!" and so on.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:27.032
Let's say we're interested in the family of words that have a B and an A and then any number of more As, and then an exclamation point.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:35.266
We can't specify that as a single word for "find" or even as a finite set of words, because there's an infinite set of words.

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:43.132
And so what a regular expression is is a way of describing that infinite set of words in an interface that allows you to find them.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:50.599
So a regular expression, which we'll also call a pattern, is a way of describing this infinite set of possible words.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.132
We'll describe it as a string, and a string starts with a B and is necessarily followed by an A,

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:06.832
and then followed by any number of subsequent As, and for that we'll use a special notation, A*.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:11.199
The asterisk means, "Any number of the preceding character."

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.966
And then it has to end in an exclamation point. So that's there.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:21.732
So the asterisk is a special character. The exclamation point, the As and the Bs are normal characters.

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:32.600
And this regular expression or pattern specifies this infinite language of "baa"s with any number of As more than one.
