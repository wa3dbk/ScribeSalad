By now, you should have a polished

You learned how to format readmes and
commit messages with others in mind.

00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:11.464
You've also learned how to be a good
member of the open source community and

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:13.160
how that's reflected in your profile.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.158
You can use the checklist I've provided
to ensure your profile is ready to

00:00:18.158 --> 00:00:19.381

you're ready to move on with your
Nanodegree, congratulations.
