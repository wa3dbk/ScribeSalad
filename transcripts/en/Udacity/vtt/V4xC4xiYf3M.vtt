00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.260
Let us now look at the solution.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.910
The sensitivity is given by the true positives divided by

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.109
the true positives plus false negative.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:16.210
In my case, the answer is 53 divided by 53 plus 1, which is 0.98.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.790
The specificity is true negatives divided by true negative plus false positive.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.980
1 over 1 plus 33, which gives me 0.03.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.950
Now notice you might have gotten a little bit different answer for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.050
the sensitivity or even the specificity.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.740
I would like you to think why your answer may be

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.710
slightly different from the answer here in the lesson.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.820
We can discuss this further in our forum.
