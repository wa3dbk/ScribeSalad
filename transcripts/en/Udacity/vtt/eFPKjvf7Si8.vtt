The first step we did to use a diffuse material was to change the Mesh Basic

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:08.598
Material to Mesh Lambert Material. The next step is to simply not use flat

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:12.814
shading. I admit it, I put the flat shading into the material so that you'd have

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.430
to remove it in this exercise. The reason I did this was so I could explain

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.624
shading normals to you. So, to make things look smooth, just take out this

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:23.745
shading argument, shading, three, flat shading.
