In the last quiz, we got 2 values of x that satisfy this equation, which were

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.221
the same as the ones we found through factoring earlier on. It's definitely

00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:12.316
quicker to factor if you can, but sometimes it's hard to see right away how to

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:16.280
factor an expression, so if you don't know how, now you have another way to

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.951
solve for x in situations like this. Let's look at the equation 4x squared minus

00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:25.194
4x minus 3 equals 0. This is a quadratic formula so we should be able to use the

00:00:25.194 --> 00:00:29.427
quadratic formula to solve it, even if there are other methods of doing it. So

00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:33.387
what values of a, b and c should we use for this equation, if we are going to

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:34.948
use the quadratic formula?
