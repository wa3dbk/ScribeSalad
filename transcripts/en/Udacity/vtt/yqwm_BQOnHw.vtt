Did you get 18 5th and 3 5th? If you did, excellent work. This is a really tough

00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:07.775
problem. Even if you didn't get this answer. If you got part of the solution

00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:11.772
right, or some of the variables right, great work. I'm going to first solve this

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:15.874
problem using substitution. So, if you chose this method, stay with me. If you

00:00:15.874 --> 00:00:20.212
tried elimination, fast forward until you see the word, elimination, here. Also

00:00:20.212 --> 00:00:24.052
at any point if you find a correction to your work, pause the video and then try

00:00:24.052 --> 00:00:28.038
and keep solving. Finding the types of mistakes you make is really important so

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:31.991
that we can improve on our math skills. Try and think about the mistake you made

00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:35.696
and where you went wrong. Thinking about that mistake can prevent you from

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:39.645
making it in the future. I think it's easier to solve for x using this equation.

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:44.333
I just need to add y to both sides. So I have x equals 3 plus y, and remember I

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:49.925
could also write this as y plus 3. Addition is commutative. Now that I've solve

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:55.320
for x I can replace this x with the equivalent expression.3 plus y. So I have 3

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.627
times 3 plus y plus 2y equals 12, I distribute the positive 3 to get 9 plus 3y

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:05.815
plus 2y equals 12. 3y and 2y make positive 5y. And then I just carry down the

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:11.001
terms. So 9 plus 5y equals 12. I can subtract 9 from both sides, so 5y is equal

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.846
to 3. And finally I divide both sides by 5, so y equals 3 fifths. Now I can

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:21.308
substitute the value of y, which is 3 fifths, into the second equation. I chose

00:01:21.308 --> 00:01:26.354
the second equation, because these coefficients were 1. It looked a little bit

00:01:26.354 --> 00:01:31.265
more simple than the first equation. So I plus in the value of 3 5th for y. Then

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:35.852
I need to add 3 5th to both side to isolate x. So x is equal to 3 plus 3 5th. We

00:01:35.852 --> 00:01:40.789
know we can write this as a mixed number. The mixed number is 3 and 3 fifths. We

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.126
have the whole number and then the fraction. Converting this to an improper

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:48.964
fraction we would have 18 fifths. This is some amazing math work for

00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:53.318
substitution. If we use elimination I can multiply the second equation by a

00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:57.546
positive 2. This will allow me to eliminate the y variable. You might have

00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:02.808
chosen to multiply this equation by negative 3. That would've let you eliminate

00:02:02.808 --> 00:02:08.211
the x variable. That's okay, that could work too. 2 times x is 2 x. 2 times

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:13.674
negative y is negative 2 y. And 2 times 3 is 6. So I get 5 x is equal to 18, and

00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:19.418
the y's eliminate. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5. So 1 x is equal to

00:02:19.418 --> 00:02:24.514
18 5ths. We know that y should be 3 5ths, so let's see if we can find it, using

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:29.302
our x value. I'm going to use the second equation to find the value of y. I take

00:02:29.302 --> 00:02:34.194
18 5ths, and plug it in for x. So I have 18 5ths, minus y, equals 3. Well I know

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:39.066
18 5ths is really 3 and 3 5ths. This is the mixed number that represents, or is

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:44.982
equal to, this improper fraction. 5 goes into 18 3 times and I have a remainder

00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:50.807
of 3, or 3 5th. So I have to take away some number from 3 and 3 5th to get 3.

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:57.141
Well, this number has to be 3 5th. If I just think about it I know why it has to

00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:59.642
be 3 5th. There's our solution.
