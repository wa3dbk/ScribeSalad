00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.750
Having covered how machines communicate across a local area

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.600
network, we now turn our attention to how they communicate

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.140
across the internet and the network layer of our

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.020
hierarchy. Whereas other layers use a variety of technologies and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.219
protocols, the network layer really only uses IP, which

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.140
is short for internet protocol. Every machine on the internet

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.530
proper gets a unique 32 bit address. Which is usually

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.830
written out as four decimal numbers between 0 and 255.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.930
So, for example, 72.14.248.239 is currently the

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.350
IP address for Udacity's home page. Ranges of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.380
addresses are allocated by regional internet registries. All

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.910
of which, are under control by IANA, the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.360
International Assign Numbers Authority. The range of themselves

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.280
are commonly specified by a 32 bit IP

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.320
followed by a slash, and then the number

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.750
of bits understood to specify the network ID.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.610
This is referred to as CIDR notation. The first, number of bits of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.830
the 32, specify the range and then the rightmost bits specify

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.878
the particular host. For example, MIT was allocated long ago the

00:01:06.878 --> 00:01:11.880
range, 18.0.0.0 slash 8. Meaning

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.760
that any IP starting with 18 belongs to MIT. There are

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.510
about 2 to the 24th of them.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.460
Georgia Tech has the range 130.207.0.0/16 meaning that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.890
any IP starting with 130.207 belongs to Georgia Tech. There are about 2 to the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.980
16th of those because there are 16 unspecified bits in this range. At the time

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.510
of this recording a New Jersey company called

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.160
Linode has been allocated the address range 50.116.48.0/20.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.496
So this gives them 12 bits of host, and the range 50.116.48.0

00:01:51.496 --> 00:01:56.026
to 50.116.63.255. Again about two to

00:01:56.026 --> 00:02:00.357
the 12th IPs. IPs have become a precious commodity these days, as most all

00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:02.750
of them have been allocated. And not very

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.039
efficiently. For instance, tech savvy as they are,

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.050
MIT is probably not using all 2 to the 24th, or 16 million of it's addresses.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.930
One solution to this problem is simply to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.720
expanded the address space to use more bits. The

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.750
new internet protocol, called IPv6, the old one

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.210
is call IPv4, uses 128 bit addresses. The problem

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.910
is that IPV4 is so universal, and so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.350
many other systems depend on it, that adoption of

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.940
the new protocol has been slow. And I encourage

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.460
you to read more about this on your own.
