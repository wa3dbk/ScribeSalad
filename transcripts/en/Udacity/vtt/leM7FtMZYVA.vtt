00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.755
A ton of the numbers that we encounter in
daily life are rational numbers since we

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:09.405
can count many things or just can split
them into parts that we can measure, but

00:00:09.417 --> 00:00:14.135
there are certain situations that might
not be quite this simple. Let's say that

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:18.965
you have a little cousin and she wants you
to build her a slide. This isn't just any

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:23.691
slide though. Your cousin is very
particular. She wants the slide to be

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:29.032
exactly eight feet high, and she wants it
to go from a trainer backyard, down into

00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:35.179
the lake by her house which is 12 feet
away from the tree. Now you need to figure

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.537
out how long the slide will be so that you
can buy enough material to make it.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:44.367
You know that there is a rule for the
right triangles, the Pythagorean Theorem,

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:49.770
that says that the side lengths of a right
triangle, a, b, and c, where c is the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:59.101
longest side, fit the formula a^2+b^2=c^2.
Since the slide, the tree, and the ground

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:05.670
make a right triangle, with the slide
itself as the longest side, you know that

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:12.033
you can begin to look for the length of
the slide by first taking 8^2+12^2, which

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:18.870
is just 8 times 8 + 12 times 12.
For starters, what is this number? Please

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.729
type the number of your answer into the
box right here. Remember to do your

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.098
multiplication before your addition.
