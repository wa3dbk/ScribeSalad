00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.160
The one way property of hash function
is extremely useful for security.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.040
Recall that the one way property means
that it is easy to compute a hash

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.090
from the message, but it is impossible
to find a message from the hash.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.550
You can think of it this way.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.103
You can make hashbrown from potatoes.

00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:22.900
But you can't make potatoes
out of hashbrowns.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.460
Let's look at this example of
using hash to verify password.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.540
Hash is particularly useful for
password verification.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.910
We all know that when we
authenticate ourself to a system,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.660
we need to supply a password.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.500
Now let's look under the hood.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.670
What happens?

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.330
For example, when a user
supplies the password "candy,"

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.680
the system would take the input
"candy" and hash it, and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.450
then compare the hash value with the
stored hash of a password on the system.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.940
If they match,
then the access is allowed.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.530
Otherwise, access is denied.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.490
That is, the clear text password
candy is never stored on the system.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.190
Only the hash of the password
is stored on the system.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.350
And then whenever the user types in
a password to authenticate him or

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.830
herself to the system,
the input will be hashed.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.850
And then the hash of the input
password will be compared

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.950
with the stored hash of the password.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.880
You may ask, why not just store
the clear text password on the system?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.960
Think about it, if you do that then
anyone who gains access to the system

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.940
can look at the clear text password and
then impersonate the user.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.950
This can include attackers or
even other users on a system.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.630
Therefore, we never store the plain
text of the passwords on system,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.590
only the has values.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.420
Of course,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.558
if an attacker gains access to system,
he can steal the hash of the password.

00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:57.730
Then what the attacker can do is guess
possible passwords one by one and

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.020
hash each guess password and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.620
compare the hash value with
the stolen hash of the password.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.660
If they match,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.449
then the attacker knows that he had
correctly guessed the password.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.730
Therefore, it is important for us to use
a password that's very hard to guess.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.780
For example, we should not use
any word in the dictionary.
