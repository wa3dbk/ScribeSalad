00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.045
Here's what a scaling matrix looks like. Set all three values here to one and

00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:09.940
you get the identity matrix. If you want to uniformly scale something to be

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.927
three times as large as before, set SX, SY, and SZ to all be three. If you want

00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:19.672
to instead just stretch something up along the Y axis so that it's five times as

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:24.132
tall, set SX and SZ to be one, and SY to be five. There's just one funny thing

00:00:24.132 --> 00:00:28.667
that happens with scaling in particular. It can mess up normals. Remember we're

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:32.561
not just transforming points with matrices, we're also transforming shading

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.071
normals. If you run normals through a translation matrix, nothing happens to

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.822
them. They're vectors so they don't get touched. If you run normals though a

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:44.350
rotation matrix, things are fine. Here's a triangle from a side view, looking

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.487
along it's plane, along with it's normal. If you uniformally scale this object

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:52.960
to be larger, look what happens. The object grows larger, as does the normal.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.740
The good news is that the normal doesn't change direction, so all we have to do

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.160
is re-normalize it before using it in any lighting equations. If you

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.733
non-uniformally scale an object, In other words, stretch or squish it. Things

00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:09.800
get weird. Here I stretch the triangle in one direction. The normal vector has

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.567
also stretched upwards and is clearly no longer pointing in the right direction.

00:01:13.568 --> 00:01:17.443
To solve this problem, we need to inverse and transpose a matrix.
