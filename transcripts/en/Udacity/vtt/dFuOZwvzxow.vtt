00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.060
There are a lot of subjects
that students learn about from

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.530
kindergarten all the way
through college,

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.220
that we could teach in some
really interesting ways.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.790
So for example,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.230
let's imagine you doing a unit on the
Amazonian rainforest in biology class.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.910
One way you could teach that material
is by piling all your students on

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.670
to an airplane.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.480
Flying them down to
the Amazonian rainforest and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.020
letting them actually learn about it
by catching animals, dissecting them,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.880
watching them in their natural habitat,
learning about them that way.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.346
It would be really interesting and
really authentic, and really engaging,

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:28.150
and completely unfeasible.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.050
We can't load student onto
airplanes like that and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.470
fly them down to a dangerous area just
to learn about how the rainforest works.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.010
But what we can do is bring
them that experience to their

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.170
computers through something like
Amazon Trail, which is a game or

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.100
a simulation you all
might be familiar with.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.810
So what we can do is we can use
computers to construct simulations of

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.990
the kinds of environments or

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.120
experiences we want students to have and
let them engage with it that way.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.030
This can be powerful in another
on a number of different ways.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.060
It's very authentic.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.630
It let's them see not only the content we
want them to learn but also potentially

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.520
how people researching that content
actually work in their day to day life.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.540
let's them see what is it like to
actually research biology down

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.140
in the Amazon?

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.680
Or what is it like to
capture marine animals and

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.010
investigate them as a marine biologist?

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.580
It's also powerful because it can be
very empowering to let students explore

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.460
things on their own.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.900
They kind of get to drive their own
learning and drive their investigation

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.050
which aligns very nicely with some
other things we've talked about so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.450
far in this class.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.090
So, simulation-based learning is a great
way to bring authentic and engaging

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.000
learning experiences to students
through the power of their computers.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.770
So, in this morsel, we're going to talk
about how we can build simulations that

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.740
are engaging and authentic for the
material we want to teach the students.
