00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.034
Well, we know that x cannot equal 0. If x equaled 0, then this first fraction

00:00:06.034 --> 00:00:10.636
would have a denominator of 0, and the second fraction would also have a

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:15.516
denominator of 0. We know denominators can never equal 0 for fractions, they

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:20.062
would be undefined. So, even when we attempt to solve this equation, if we were

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:24.210
to get an answer of x equals 0, we would have to exclude it from our solution

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.316
set. We know x can never be equal to 0.
