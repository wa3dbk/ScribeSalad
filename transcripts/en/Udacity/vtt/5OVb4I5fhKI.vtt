00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.230
Now let's discuss
the Secure Hash Algorithm or SHA.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.240
The Secure Hash Algorithm
was developed by NIST.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.661
The original algorithm is SHA-1.

00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:15.290
SHA-1 produces a hash value of 160 bits.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.230
Later, NIST revised the SHA standard and
specify the SHA-2 algorithms.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.500
This algorithms have key lengths of 256,
384 and 512 bits,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.970
and their operations
are similar to SHA-1.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.930
This table compares the SHA parameters.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.185
The message digest size refers to
the length of the hash value, so for

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:47.140
SHA-1 it is 160 bits, and for
SHA-512 the hash length is 512 bits.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.840
Message size is a size
limit on the input.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.290
You can consider these size limits
are not having an effect in practice,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.630
because most if not all
messages will be smaller.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.700
For example, even with SHA-1,
the message size is limited to 2 to 64.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.390
This means that you
can hash a message so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.490
big that it occupies the entire
address space of a 64 bit computer.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.125
You can also think about
it in another way.

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:19.320
2 to the 43 bits is already a terabyte.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.380
As we can see,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.730
the algorithms from left to right
produce hash values with more bits.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.750
Hence, they are more secure as
we move from left to right.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.730
For example, with SHA-1
because the hash value has 160

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.894
bits then the search space for the
attacker to find a collision is 2 to 80.

00:01:39.894 --> 00:01:44.030
Whereas for
SHA-512 the search space is 2 to 256.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.967
In this lecture we will provide
a description of SHA-512,

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:52.550
the other versions are quite similar.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.460
For SHA-512 it takes as an input

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.200
a message that's smaller
than 2 to the 128.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.530
Again, this is not a limit that
will have any impact in practice.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.880
The output is a hash value
that is in 512 bits.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.247
The input is processed block by
block and each block has 1024 bits.
