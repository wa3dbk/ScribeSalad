00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.440
All right, you're done. 
Let's go look at the solution.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.810
Where we left off last time,
as you can see,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.536
we have two empty queries
for LOCATION_ID and LOCATION.

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:14.410
These two queries look a lot like
the queries we have for Weather.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.391
For LOCATION_ID,

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.370
this looks almost exactly
like what we do for Weather,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.690
except we use a hard-coded query

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.620
rather than relying on the one 
passed into the function.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.210
Since we know that this is always
going to be a long integer value,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.429
it is easy to just build the value
into the query string.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.926
LOCATION, on the other hand,

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:36.873
looks almost exactly 
like the Weather query.

00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:39.580
We just pass all the parameters
into the database.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.540
You didn't think you're going 
to get away without testing, did you?

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.980
Don't worry, it's really easy
to add this test.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.810
It turns out that calling 
our function within the provider

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.360
works almost exactly the same 
as the way we did the weather table.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.841
All we have to do is replace 
WeatherEntry.CONTENT_URI

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:57.645
with LocationEntry.CONTENT_URI.

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:02.420
And of course we still have to delete 
the two columns that we can't support.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.873
Now that will actually work.

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:05.786
So, let's test that to make sure that works.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.270
And our test passed, as expected.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.490
The interesting thing about this test

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.800
is that it's just only testing 
the first query

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.070
and it just happens to work because 
we deleted the database before the start.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.160
It'd be much more interesting to query
for the row that we just inserted.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.030
And this will test the other query.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.970
Now, let's run the test again.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.833
And those also passed.

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:28.246
So, we have some of our queries within
our content provider functioning.

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:29.360
But unfortunately,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.280
we still have to do some of the 
more complicated things in the provider.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.680
Let's talk about joins.
