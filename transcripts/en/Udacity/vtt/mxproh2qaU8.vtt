00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.290
That's the idea behind a technique that

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.450
I'm going to describe to you called ballooning.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.590
The idea is to have a special device driver installed in every guest operating

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.740
system. So even if it is a fully virtualized setting, since device drivers can

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.410
be installed on the fly, with the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.930
cooperation of the guest operating system. The hypervisor

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.450
can install the device driver, which is

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.390
called a balloon, in the operating system.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.850
And this balloon device driver is the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.070
key for managing memory pressures that maybe experienced

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.360
by a virtual machine or a desktop operating system. In a virtualized setting.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.800
Let's say that the house needs more memory suddenly. And this may be a result of

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.850
another guest operating system, saying that it

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.240
needs more memory. So what the hypervisor would

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.470
do, is It'll contact one of the

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.000
guest operating system that currently is not actively

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.630
using all of its memory, let's say. And talk to this balloon driver that it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.440
has installed through a private channel that

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.090
exists between the hypervisor and the balloon driver.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.230
So this is something that only the hypervisor knows

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.080
about because this is a special device driver that

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.100
the hypervisor has installed. It knows how to get

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.030
to this device driver and tell it to do something.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.540
And in this case, what the hypervisor is going to

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.680
do is tell this balloon device driver to inflate. What

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.525
that means is that this balloon device driver is

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:42.410
going to make requests to the guest operating system saying I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.190
need more memory. I need more memory, I

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.680
need more memory. And the guest operating system will

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.430
of course, give this balloon driver the memory that

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.530
it is requesting. And since the amount of physical

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.150
memory that's available to the guest operating system

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.100
is finite. If one process, in this case, the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.870
balloon driver, is making requests from the guest saying

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.740
give me more memory. Guest has to necessarily make

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.810
room for that by paging out to the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.830
disk unwanted pages from the total memory footprint

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.650
of all the processes that are currently running

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.470
in this guest operating system. And once it is

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.330
done the swapping out of pages, and perhaps

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.390
even entire processes out onto the disc. That's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.000
the way it can make room for the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.630
request that is coming from this balloon driver. Now,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.490
once the balloon driver has gotten all this extra memory out of this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.560
guest operating system. It can return those physical memories.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.990
The real physical memory, or the machine memory, back to the hypervisor. So we

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.700
started with this house needing more machine memory. And the way,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.050
the house got that more machine memory is by contacting

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.050
its balloon driver installed in one of the guest operating systems that is not

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.650
actively using all of its resources. Asking the balloon to inflate and inflating

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.690
the balloon is essentially meaning that we

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.580
are acquiring more memory from the guest

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.780
operating system. So, you can see visually

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.080
that the footprint of the balloon goes

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.890
up because of the inflation. That means, it's got

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.600
a bigger memory footprint. And all of this memory

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.370
footprint has extra resources that it can simply return

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.570
to the hypervisor. It's not going to use it. It

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.550
just wants to get it so that it can

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.700
return it to the hypervisor. So that's this path

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.190
here. So the opposite of what I've just described

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.440
is a situation where the house needs less memory.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.750
Or, in other words, it has more memory

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.850
to give away to guest operating system. So maybe

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.020
it is this guest that requested more memory

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.360
in the first place, And in that case, it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.080
wants the guest to get to the memory that it wanted. And the way it

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.733
can do that is as follows. Once again the

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:14.530
hypovisor through it's private channel will contact the balloon driver and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.260
tell the balloon driver to deflate the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.029
balloon. By deflate what is being instructed

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.510
to the balloon driver is to contract

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.180
its memory footprint. So, if it contracts its

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.260
memory footprint by deflating, it is actually

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.860
releasing memory into the guest operations. So,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.950
available physical memory. In the guest operating

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.920
system is going to increase, because of the fact

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.130
that the balloon is deflating and giving out

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.820
the memory that is currently sitting on. So

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.380
now the guest operating system has more memory

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.700
to play with. That's the effect of the balloon

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.610
deflating is that the guest operating system has

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.360
more memory. Which means that it can page

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.180
in from the disk, the working set of

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.910
processes that are executing on this guest operating system.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.180
So that those processes can have more memory resources than they've been able to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.040
because of the balloon occupying a lot of the memory. So, this technique

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.350
of ballooning assumes cooperation with the guest

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.940
operating system. So that based on the

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.460
need of the hour the hypervisor can

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.570
work with the guest operating system implicitly.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.900
Without the guest really knowing about it

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.280
because it is all happening through the

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.470
balloon driver that has been installed. By the hypervisor in each of the guest

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.120
operating systems. And this technique of ballooning

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.855
is applicable to both fully virtualized and

00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:51.970
para-virtualized environments to ease the over commitment

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.660
of memory by the hypervisor to the guests.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.640
I mean, it's sort of line airline reservations. You

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.060
always Notice that in airline reservation, the airlines tend

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.210
to sell more seats than what they have with

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.290
the hope that someone is not going to show up.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.800
That's the same sort of thing that is being

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.700
done here that there is a finite amount of

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.490
physical resources available with the hypervisor. And it is

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.270
doling it out to all the guest operating systems.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.070
&gt;&gt; And what it wants to do is,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.510
it wants to be able to reacquire some of those resources to satisfy the needs

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.560
of another guest operating system that is experiencing

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.210
a memory pressure at any point of time.
