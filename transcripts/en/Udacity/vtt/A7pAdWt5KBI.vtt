00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's get another example and this time will be quite a bit more specific.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We already wrote a random tester for the little bounded line queue data structure

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and one thing we might want to ask ourselves is "Did that further do a good job at all?"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, if you wrote a queue and find all the type of the bugs that I seeded in the queued data structure,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
then you probably did a pretty job but let's take a look again.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We're going to do is we're going to look at the queue as a finite state machine.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to see what kind of states we can drive that machine into using the random tester.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're going to start off with an empty queue and 50% of the time, at this point,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we're going to make a dequeue call, which is going to fail, 50% of the time,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we're going to enqueue something resulting in a queue containing one element.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Okay, from here, it should be pretty obvious what could happen.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We can dequeue something going back to the empty state

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or enqueue something going to the two element state unless it is assumed that that's full.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And so, the dynamic process that we're going to get when we run a random tester is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
some sort of a random walk through this finite state machine.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And so, what we want to ask ourselves is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"Does this random walk have a reasonable probability of executing all the cases?"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And so here, probably the most interesting cases are dequeuing from an empty queue,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
enqueuing to a full queue, and then walking around the rest of the states base.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And so, what I've done is, I rig the random tester with some extra static skipping,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so you can tell us about this a little bit--so let's go take a look at that.
