00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.422
Here is my implementation of twiddle. This

00:00:02.422 --> 00:00:04.339
is a routine that you can keep this way for

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.192
many, many different applications. All it

00:00:07.193 --> 00:00:09.739
requires is a way to evaluate something that

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:11.539
depends on the parameters and gives you a

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.809
single arrow that you would like to minimize.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.660
We have three parameters in total, I set the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.806
parameters themselves to zero, but the deltas

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:20.956
to one and it’s just the counter, its unimportant.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:23.820
If the sum of D params is still larger than our

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.371
tolerance which we initially have as 0.001 and they go through all

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:29.636
the parameter sequentially I increment that

00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:32.323
by D params, find out what the arrow is if

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.088
the arrow is better than our best arrow,

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:35.693
which I initialize with the initial arrow

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:38.220
and I keep the best arrow and I even increment

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.433
D params. Otherwise, I try the other direction.

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:46.232
One, find out the arrow, if that succeeds,

00:00:46.232 --> 00:00:49.603
I keep it, I increment D params. And here is

00:00:49.603 --> 00:00:51.973
my last case, I didn’t succeed, so going to

00:00:51.973 --> 00:00:54.865
set it back to the old parameter vector and

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:58.178
decrease my D params by 0.9. I increase my

00:00:58.178 --> 00:01:00.862
counter, here is my little print out command

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:03.525
for debugging and I will turn the parameter

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:05.617
vector. So it will be comingout of the print

00:01:05.617 --> 00:01:08.470
vectors over here and play with this a little more

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.358
. If I want twiddle, compute the best parameters

00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:13.828
and then calculate the error using these

00:01:13.828 --> 00:01:15.536
parameters and print out the parameters

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:18.154
along with the arrow, I get a parameter vector

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:20.473
and I get an arrow that’s basically zero.

00:01:20.473 --> 00:01:22.709
Now let’s switch off the integral term.

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:24.682
And I can do this with a little trick.

00:01:24.682 --> 00:01:28.270
I just set D params number two, which is the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.108
final one to 0.0 as if I’ve already learned the

00:01:31.108 --> 00:01:34.082
integral term. When I run this, I get a zero

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:36.510
integral term, but the arrow that’s somewhat

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.753
larger than the final arrow, the desired. And

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:41.316
that’s because the integral term is really

00:01:41.316 --> 00:01:43.642
required to drive the arrow, down to zero. Let’s

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:47.468
also remove the D term and see what happens

00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:49.363
and the result is a really large arrow,

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:52.963
0.55. That large arrow, sustains even if

00:01:52.963 --> 00:01:55.046
I remove the over drift by commenting

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:58.305
it out. You still get an arrow, of 0.10 if

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.670
it does have a proportional controller, whereas

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.181
if I add in the differential parameter again,

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:09.827
by removing the D param 1 command the

00:02:09.827 --> 00:02:15.255
0.103 goes down to 5.7 to the minus 11,

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:17.268
which is practically zero. So you can see

00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:20.162
the importance of the D term for driving

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:22.534
the arrow, down to zero, in the case without

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:26.108
drift and for the integral term in cases for

00:02:26.108 --> 00:02:28.352
vowels with a systematic bias. You play

00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:29.800
a little bit more with this code for the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.800
homework assignment. But this is it for now.
