00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
[Narrator] And the answer is 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1, and 0.2,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and to see we just have to normalize those importance weights.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The sum of those numbers over here is 6.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, we divide 0.6 by 6. We get 0.1.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
1.2 divided by 6 is 0.2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
2.4 divided by 6 is 0.4.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.621
Obviously those over here add up to 1.
