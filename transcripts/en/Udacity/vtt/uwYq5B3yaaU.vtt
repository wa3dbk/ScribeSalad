00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Welcome back!

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're about to start unit 4, and one of the things we're going to cover

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is the suprising power you can get from just writing down something

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you've already computed and referring back to it later.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That actually came up once in my life.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
A number of years ago, I had the priviledge of working for Microsoft Research

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
on a project to try to find and fix bugs in Windows.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now most of you are probably watching from a moon based in the not too distant future,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but in the present and in the past, bugs in Windows were a big deal.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In fact, it would often crash and lead to the dreaded blue screen of death.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It turned out that as much as we like to pick on Microsoft,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
most of the bugs weren't in Microsoft code, but in third-party code

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
written to drive various bits of hardware, like screens or printers or memory sticks.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This software was called Device Drivers, and it might work something like

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
this memory stick that I have right here.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Microsoft wrote a tool to put this Device Driver software through torture tests.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you're memory stick, I might add data to you and then in the middle of reading it out,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
pull you out or turn off the power, or in general, apply these normal operations very fast

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
or in a surprising order.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And this really worked. They found a lot of bugs.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So many bugs that's it's now a shipping product--the Microsoft Static Driver Verifier.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The heart of this idea was a computer science notion known as model checking,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
figuring out how a program behaves by looking at its source code.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
A key to that was remembering things that had already been computed.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If I already know how you behave when I turn off the power in the middle of an operation,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I don't have to recompute it, which might be very expensive.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So this relatively simple notion of writing down things so that we don't have to recompute them,

00:01:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
is formerly called memoization, and it's one of the gems we'll get to in this unit.
