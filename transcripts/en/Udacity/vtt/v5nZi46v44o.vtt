00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.721
As we increase n toward infinity, the number we have for A over here gets

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:09.810
closer and closer to a certain very special number. That number is e. But what

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.240
on earth is e? We haven't been using that letter to stand for anything. Well,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.664
this is a very important point. e is actually a number, an irrational number to

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:23.684
be precise. And we can approximate it as 2.718281828459, and of course, this

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:29.359
decimal continues forever, since this number is irrational. It's a number that

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.275
has special significance for higher level mathematics, biology, chemistry and

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:41.349
many other fields. So it's really exciting that we're going to get to work with

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:45.426
it. Conveniently, scientific calculators also generally have buttons for e on

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:50.535
them. On my calculator, it's right here, and when I press it, well, it just

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:56.542
types the letter e. But if we press equals, then you see a rounded version of

00:00:56.542 --> 00:01:03.352
this number. Now, remember, this is not the exact value of e, this is an

00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:06.247
approximation.
