The letters that belong here are, in order from left to right, D, B, A, and E.

00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:10.652
So let me translate that into a word equation by inserting these in the proper

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:15.672
spots. We end up with total cost equals price per gallon, times number of

00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:20.543
gallons ordered, Plus the rush order fee. Remember, that Grant will have to pay

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:25.000
the rush order fee, no matter how many gallons he orders. But the more gallons

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:28.739
he orders, the more he will pay total, since he pays by the gallon.
