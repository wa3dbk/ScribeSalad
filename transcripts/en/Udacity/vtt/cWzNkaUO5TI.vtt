00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.359
In this lesson,

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:05.250
we're going to discuss the details of
how to build native Android wear apps.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.090
These can do so
much more than just notifications, and

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.260
you have a full Android
implementation to help you out here.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.520
Having Android underneath means that
most of your Android concepts that

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.110
you're familiar with apply here too.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.500
So you'll be reusing a lot
of your existing knowledge.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.270
So to build an Android Wear app,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.810
we're going to discuss how these apps
are built, how wearables communicate

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.270
with the outside world, how to
create user interfaces for them, and

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.750
how to implement useful functionality
with them, such as sensor processing.
