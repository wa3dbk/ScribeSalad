00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.932
In Three.js there are a number of ways to set a color. See the additional course

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:07.793
materials for a link to the documentation. We'll cover four of them here. You

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:11.530
start by defining the material. We'll talk more later about what this material

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.378
does. For now, just know that you can set a color for it. If you don't set any

00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:19.252
at all, the default is white. The MeshLambertMaterial object that you've just

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:22.980
created has several different parameters. This can be set when you first create

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.766
the object or later in a number of different ways. One of these parameters is

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:31.285
the material's color. These parameters have type THREE.Color and you can use all

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:35.344
the methods associated with it. One method is to set the r, g and b channels

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:40.048
separately. Here I'm setting the color to red. This directly sets the variables

00:00:40.048 --> 00:00:44.518
r, g, and b in the color attribute to the desired values. I can also use the

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:49.546
setRGB method on the color class, setting the color to orange. A more compact

00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:53.116
way to set a color is to use hexidecimal numbers. Here I'm setting a bright

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:59.046
blue. The value 0x1280FF is a single number holding the red, green, and blue

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:05.726
channels all together. Let's break it down. The 0x prefix means that this is

00:01:05.726 --> 00:01:12.204
hexidecimal number, base 16. Where the letter a means 10, b means 11, on up to f

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:15.764
meaning 15. If you don't know about hexidecimals, see the additional course

00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:19.464
materials for a link to more information. 3 channels, r, g, and b, are each

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:24.706
encoded in order. Trading each 2 digits as the channel's value. For example, the

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:31.499
red channel is one two in hexadecimal. This means 1, 16 plus 2, to give 18 in

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:38.342
decimal value. Green is computed in a similar fashion. 8 times 16 plus 0 gives

00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:46.024
the level of 128. Blue is at the maximum, ff, adding up to 255. Each of these

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:50.368
values can range from 0 to 255. The range 0 to 255 is used, because most

00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:55.260
computer monitors have 8-bits of precision for each color channel. 2 to the 8th

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.999
power is 256. So the range 0 to 255 is the entire range of possible color

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:04.202
channel values. So, once you have a color you like, in Three.js, you can

00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:08.943
conveniently just paste it into place. In fact there's a way of initializing the

00:02:08.943 --> 00:02:13.076
material to color it when you create it. When you put something in braces like

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:16.754
this, you're initializing that variable in the object to the given value. This

00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:20.262
particular hexidecimal value gives a yellow color. Note that the hexidecimal

00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:24.429
letters, such as the f's here, can be upper or lower case. It doesn't matter. I

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.353
tend to use upper case as it makes it more readable.
