00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.700
Today we'll talk about common sense reasoning. You and I, as cognitive

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.806
individuals, are very good at common sense reasoning. We can make natural,

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:14.006
obvious inferences about the world. How can we help AI agents make similar

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:19.280
common sensical inferences about the world? Suppose I had a robot, and

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.920
I asked a robot, find the weather outside. I don't want the robot to jump out of

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.870
the window to see whether it's raining outside but, why should the robot not

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.860
jump out of the window? What tells it that it's not a very common sensical thing

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.550
to do? We'll talk about common sense reasoning using a frame representation.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.330
We'll start talking about certain small set of primitive actions.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.140
There are only 14 of them, but they bring a lot of power because they organize

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.400
a lot of knowledge. These primitive actions can be organized into

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.360
hierarchies of sub actions. These actions can result in changes in the state.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.900
This is important, because that is what allows the robot to infer that if I were

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.140
to take this action, that result might occur. That state might be achieved. So

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.910
then it decides not to jump out of the window, because it might get hurt.
