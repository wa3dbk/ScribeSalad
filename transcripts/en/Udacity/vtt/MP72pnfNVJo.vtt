00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.981
Like I mentioned before, it's often useful to think about absolute value in

00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:08.064
terms of distance on a number line. Here, I've marked the points 5 and 14. So,

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:12.056
if I want to count from 5 up to 14, it's going to take me 9 spots. The same is

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:16.071
true if I want to count from 14 back to 5. It's going to take me 9 places along

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:20.818
the number line to get there. So once you get from negative 12 to 5, I can see

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:25.481
with my number line that it is going to take me. I'll spare you counting, 17

00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:30.240
steps. Considering we know that this distance is 17, which of these following

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.390
absolute value expressions shows that distance?
