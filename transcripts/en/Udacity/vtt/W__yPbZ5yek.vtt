00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.890
Finish factoring this polynomial by finding the factors needed to rewrite the x

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.040
term. Once you've rewritten the x term, use factoring by grouping to finish up.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.965
And you might have noticed that this problem is slightly different because we

00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:17.004
have a 2 here. Our coefficient, our a value for the x squared term is not equal

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:17.553
to one.
