00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In real life, things depend on each other.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Say you can be born smart or dumb and for the sake of simplicity, let's assume

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:26.000
whether you're smart or dumb is just nature's flip of a coin.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now whether you become a professor at Standford is non-entirely independent.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I would argue becoming a professor in Standford is generally not very likely,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so probability might be 0.001 but it also depends on whether you're born smart or dumb.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If you are born smart the probability might be larger, whereas if you're born dumb,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the probability might be marked more smaller.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now this just is an example, but if you can think of the most two consecutive coin flips.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The first is whether you are born smart or dumb.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The second is whether you get a job on a certain time.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And now if we take them in these two coin flips, they are not independent anymore.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So whereas in our last unit, we assumed that the coin flips were independent,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that is, the outcome of the first didn't affect the outcome of the second.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
From now on, we're going to study the more interesting cases where the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
outcome of the first does impact the outcome of the second,

00:01:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and to do so you need to use more variables to express these cases.
