00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.930
So this is the abstraction layer seen by the application that is giving this

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.980
illusion of a global virtual memory. This layer is the DSM software

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.740
implementation layer that implements this global

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.040
virtual memory abstraction. In particular, this DSM

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.750
software layer, which exists on every one

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.750
of these processors, knows that the point

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.060
of access to a page by a processor, who

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.160
exactly to contact, as the owner of the page,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.500
to get the current copy of the page. For

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.230
instance, let's say that there was a page fault on

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.350
this processor one. For a particular portion of the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.170
global address space. That portion of the global address space

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.680
is currently not resident here in the physical memory

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.970
of processor one. So, there is a page fault over

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.170
here and there is cooperation, as I mentioned earlier,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.520
between the operating system and the DSM. So, when

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.700
the page fault happens, that page fault is going

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.130
to be communicated by the operating system to the DSM

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.080
software saying that here is the page fault, you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.610
handle it. What the DSM software is going to do

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.470
is, it knows the owner of the page, and

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.230
so it's going to contact the owner of the page.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.370
And ask the owner of the page to get the current

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.750
copy of the page. So the current copy of the page

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.720
resides over here. So the owner, either it itself has the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.120
current copy of the page or it knows which node currently has

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.460
the current copy of the page, and so it's going to

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.770
send the page over to the node that is requesting it. The

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.330
current copy of the page is over here. It's going to

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.860
come over to this guy, and recall what I said about ownership

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.970
of the pages. The residency of this page doesn't

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.930
necessarily mean that this is the owner of the page.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.240
The owner of this page could have been this

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.200
node, so the DSM software would have contacted the owner.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.660
And the owner would have said, oh you know

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.410
what. That particular place to cut and copy is on

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.790
this node. So the DSM software would go to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.430
this note, and fetch this page, and put it into

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.160
this processor. So that this processor is happy.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.300
So once the page has been brought in to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.220
the physical memory, then the DSN software contacts the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.130
virtual memory manager and says, I've completed now, processing

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.190
the page fault, brought the page that is missing

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.670
and put it into a particular location in the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.800
physical memory. Would you please update the page table

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.340
for this guy, so that he can resume execution?

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.320
Well, then the VM manager gets into action.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.800
And updates to page table for this thread

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.860
to indicate that the faulty virtual page is

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.380
now mapped to a physical page, and then

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.460
the process or the thread can resume its

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.760
execution. So this is a way coherence is

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.310
going to be maintained by the DSM software. The

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.260
cooperation between DSM software and the VM manager.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.490
And the coherence maintenance is happening at the level of individual pages. An

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.038
early examples of systems that built software DSM include

00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:16.690
Ivy from Yale, Clouds from Georgia Tech

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.190
Mirage from UPenn, and Munin from Rice. All of

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.350
these are distributed shared memory systems and they all used coherence

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.980
maintenance at the granularity of an individual page, and they

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.870
used a protocol which is often referred to as a single writer protocol. That

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.870
is, I mentioned that the directory associated with the portion

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.260
of the virtual memory space managed by each one of these nodes

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.350
and the directory has information as to who all are sharing a page at any point

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.010
of time. Multiple readers can share a page

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.900
at any point of time, but a single writer

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.870
is only allowed to have the page at any

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.242
point of time. So, if there is the writer

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:06.894
for a particular page, let's say that loose page,

00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:09.799
which is now currently in the memory of two

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.451
different processors, if this guy wants to write to

00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.522
this page, then he has to inform through the

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:20.807
DSM software abstraction, inform the owner for this page.

00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:23.348
Let's say this guy is the owner for this

00:04:23.348 --> 00:04:25.812
page, that I want to write to this page

00:04:25.812 --> 00:04:28.969
and at that point the owner is going to invalidate

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.510
all copies of that page that exist in the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.975
entire system, so that this guy has exclusive access

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:38.055
to that page so that they can make modifications

00:04:38.055 --> 00:04:41.690
to it. So this is what is called single writer

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.160
multiple reader protocol. Easy to implement. At the point of

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.250
right to a page, what you do is, you go

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.330
through the DSM software, contact the owner. And the owner

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.730
says, I know who all have copies of the page, I'll

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.760
invalidate all of them. Once it has invalidated all the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.780
copies, then the guy who wants to write to that

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.040
page can go ahead and write to it, because that'll

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.830
be the only copy. Now the problem with the single writer

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.080
protocol is that there is potential for

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.410
what is called fault sharing. We've talked

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.160
about this already in the context of

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.960
shared memory multiprocessors. Basically the idea of fault

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.730
sharing, or the concept of fault sharing, is that data appears to be shared even

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.800
though programmatically, they are not. Let's consider

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.155
this page-based coherence maintenance. In the page-based coherence

00:05:32.155 --> 00:05:35.467
maintenance, the coherence maintenance that is done by

00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:38.503
the software, DSM software, is of the granularity

00:05:38.503 --> 00:05:40.730
of a single page. A page may be

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.450
4K bytes or 8K bytes,depending on the architecture

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.010
we're talking about. And within a page, lots

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.396
of different data structures can actually fit. So,

00:05:50.396 --> 00:05:53.778
if the coherence maintenance is being done at

00:05:53.778 --> 00:05:57.160
the level of an individual page, then we're

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.809
invalidating copies of the page in several nodes

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.123
in order to allow one guy to make

00:06:03.123 --> 00:06:06.871
modifications to some portion of that page. And

00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:09.103
that can be very severe in a page based

00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:11.695
system due to the coarse granularity of the

00:06:11.695 --> 00:06:15.638
coherence information. So for example, this one page may

00:06:15.638 --> 00:06:19.456
contain ten different data structures, each of which

00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:22.213
is governed by a distinct lock. So far as

00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:26.180
the application programmer is concerned. But, even if I get

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.720
a lock, which is for a particular data structure that

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.770
happens to be in this page. And this guy has

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.100
a lock for a different data structure which is also on

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.862
the same page. When I get the lock that is

00:06:38.862 --> 00:06:41.810
going to manipulate a particular data structure in this page,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.021
and if I want to make modifications for it, I am

00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:47.310
going go and invalidate all the other copies. When he wants

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.670
to make a change, he's going to come and invalidate my copy of the page. So

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.000
the page can be ping-ponging between, between multiple

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.730
processes. Even though they are modifying different portions

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.750
of the same page, still the coherence granularity

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.175
being a page, will result in this page

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:08.750
shuttling back and forth between these two guys,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.620
even though the application program is perfectly well behaved

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.030
in terms of using locks to govern

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.845
access to different data structures. Unfortunately, all of

00:07:19.845 --> 00:07:22.110
those data structures happened to fit within

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.510
the same page. Resulting in this fault sharing.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.110
So, page level granularity and single writer

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.840
multiple reader protocol don't live happily together. They

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.630
will lead to fault sharing. And they will lead to ping ponging of the pages,

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.440
due to the fault sharing among the

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.800
threads of the application across the entire network.
