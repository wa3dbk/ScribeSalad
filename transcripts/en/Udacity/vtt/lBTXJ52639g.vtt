00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.540
If you're a student of history you probably know that ideas come at some point

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.520
of time and the practical use may come at a much later point of time. An

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.470
excellent example of that is Boolean algebra, which

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.520
was invented at the turn of the century

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.035
as a pure mathematical exercise by George Boole.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.618
Now, Boolean algebra is the basis for pretty

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:30.860
much anything and everything we do with computers. The concept of virtualization

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.470
also had its beginning way back in time. It started with IBM VM 370 in the

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.560
60s and the early 70s. And the intent. And IBM VM370 was to give

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.530
the illusion to every user on the computer as though the computer is theirs.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.430
That was the vision and it was also a vehicle for binary support for legacy

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.700
applications that may run on older versions of IBM platforms. And then of

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.280
course we had the microkernels that we

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.300
have discussed in the earlier course module

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.560
which surfaced in the 80s and early 90s. That in turn gave way to extensibility

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.740
of operating systems in the 90s. The Stanford project SimOS in the late

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.250
90s, laid the basis for the modern resurgence of

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.110
virtualization technology at the operating system level and in fact, was the

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.280
basis for VMware. Even the specific ideas we're

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.550
going to explore in this course module. Through Xen and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.340
VMware, are papers that date back to the early 2000s. They were proposed

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.710
from the point of view of supporting application mobility, server consolidation,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.200
collocating, hosting facilities, distributed web services.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.780
These are all sort of the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.400
candidate applications for which Xen and

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.920
VMware while positioning this virtualization technology.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.420
And now today, virtualization has taken

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.250
off like anything. Why the big resurgence

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.150
today? Well, companies want a share of everybody's pie. One of the things that

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.030
has become very obvious, is the margin for device making companies in terms of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.250
profits, is very small. And everybody wants to get into providing services for

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.760
end users. This is pioneered by IBM and others are following suit as well.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.420
So the attraction with virtualization technology is that companies can now

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.220
provide resources with complete performance isolation

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.260
and bill each individual user separately. And

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.080
companies like Microsoft, Amazon, HP, you

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.570
name it, everybody's in this game wanting

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.240
to provide computing facilities through their data centers to a wide diversity

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.250
of user communities. So that it's a win-win situation for both the users

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.080
that do not want to maintain their own computing infrastructure and constantly

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.730
upgrading them. And the companies like IBM that has a way of providing

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.770
these resources on a rental basis, on a utility basis, to the user

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.300
community. You can see the dots connecting up from the extensibility studies of

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.500
the 90s like the spin and exokernel, to virtualization today, that is providing

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.700
computational resources, much like we depend on

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.680
utility companies to provide electricity and water.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.780
In other words, virtualization technology has made computing very much

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.740
like the other utilities that we use to such as electricity and water and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.960
so on. And that's the reason why there's a huge resurgence in

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.150
the user virtualization technology in all the data centers across the world.
