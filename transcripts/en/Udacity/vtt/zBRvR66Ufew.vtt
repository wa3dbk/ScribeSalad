00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And the answer is 14.14 m, which is the same as 10 m * √2.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And you see, we know that the old variance would be a 100 m², the µ thinks

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
therefore, it's 200 m² because I told you that just add up.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If we go to the standard deviation, we take the square root of this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This factors into 2*100 m², so we take the square root of this,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we get back the 10 m on the right side and you get the √2 on the left side,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which gives me the 14.14 m for the standard deviation.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That's interesting--standard deviations don't add up, variances add up

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and that was a non-trivial question.
