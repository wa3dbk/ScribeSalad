00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.600
So at the last company I was working at,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.300
I was helping set up their
user testing program.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.310
And one of the products
that they were testing for

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.310
was a desktop control software.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.390
So it helps you use your desktop.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.250
And we realized very early on,
that obviously we're not going to be

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.120
in the room when our user
starts to use the software.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.860
We're not going to be able
to give them instructions.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.900
We're not going to be able
to tell them how to use it.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.000
So we also had to use some machine
learning algorithms to help

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.479
detect what the user intended to do and
have the software respond appropriately.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.850
And we realized that
the machine learning algorithms

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.810
were very finely tuned at first to us.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.975
We would say,
we would do a certain thing and

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:50.034
it would get it every single time.

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:54.381
And we would give it
to somebody else and

00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:59.917
they would inevitably do
something different and

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:02.828
it wouldn't work at all.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.164
So, what we ended up doing is creating
a tutorial video, and this was,

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.569
our idea was that this is a prototype of
the actual video that would ship with

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:06.693
the product to explain to a customer or
a user how to use it.

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:12.126
And we ended up user
testing those in parallel.

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:14.654
So when you bring a user in our user
testing lab, we would sit them down,

00:01:14.654 --> 00:01:16.015
say we were going to show them a video.

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:18.676
We are going to then give you
a set of tasks with a software and

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:19.591
see how well you do.

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.632
And then all the, we're not testing you,
we're testing the software, all of that.

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:30.496
And the we would sit them down and

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:34.868
we would shut up.

00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:38.240
The tester would shut up,
roll a video, and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.163
be very careful not to actually
put their hands out or show them,

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:47.289
how to use the software, and
then we would test them.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.049
And so by optimizing those in parallel,
we ended up getting much,

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:48.865
much better performance, and
a much better prediction of the eventual

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:49.809
user's performance, than we would've
if we had demonstrated how to do these.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:50.470
Because we know how to trigger
the machine learning algorithms.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.209
&gt;&gt; Right, perfect.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.709
Thank you.
