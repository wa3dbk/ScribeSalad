Anesh, from India, asks:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What are some of the aspects that go into

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
building a practical Real World search engine

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and how should you use existing tools,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
such as preexisting libraries, to help build your search engine?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So one example he gives in his post,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which has a lot of great deal in there--and I encourage people to look at it--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is Beautiful Soup,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which is a Python library to parse really complicated HTML.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So in our web crawler, we just parse

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
very strict, kind of string match,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and it doesn't always follow that rule so Beautiful Soup can help with that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Should we be aware of these libraries, and how should we include them?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yeah--so there's a lot of things that are more complicated

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if you want to build a robust search engine

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that's going to work on all the pages out there on the Web.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And Anesh has a good list of some of the things that you need to think about,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and for the advanced students that are wanting to go beyond

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
what we're doing in class, it's great to start thinking about those things.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And it is also the case that you don't want to build everything yourself.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In this class, we're building things ourselves because

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we want to learn what's going on underneath

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and build as much and understand as much about computing as we can.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you're building Real software, you want to try to start from libraries

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that other people have already written that are available for you to use

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and Beautiful Soup is a very useful library for parsing HTML--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
for doing the kinds of things that get real complicated,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
if you want to find links in Real HTML code

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that can be much more complex than what we're focusing on so far.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's still using the same kinds of ideas that we do in the class,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but someone else has put a lot of effort into writing that code

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and making it work, and it's definitely a good idea to reuse libraries that are available.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You have to check, carefully, what the license is on those libraries--

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
whether you can use them or not.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But it's definitely--when you start building more complex programs,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
rather than starting from scratch and writing everything yourself,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
trying to find a library that will help you get what you need done more quickly

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is a great idea.
