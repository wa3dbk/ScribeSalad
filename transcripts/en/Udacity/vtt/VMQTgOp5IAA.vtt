00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.806
There are any number of ways to figure out how much light arrives at each pixel

00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:07.397
to form an image. In theory, you could fully simulate the world around you.

00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:11.497
Photons start from a light source, hit atoms, and they're reflected, absorbed,

00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:14.756
and so on. You would a camera in this scene, and whatever very few photons

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:18.852
actually happen to enter the camera's lens would then determine the image. As

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:22.817
you might guess doing so would take a huge amount computation for even the most

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:27.598
modest scene. A back of the envelope computation for a 40 watt bulb, shows that

00:00:27.598 --> 00:00:30.663
it emits about 10 to the 19th photons per second.
