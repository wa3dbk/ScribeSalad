As you can see, I have a search page open

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.470
on my phone. Let's go to Timeline and record a

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.580
trace. Okay. Now, let's take a look at what we

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.180
have here. First, notice that we see an event for

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.660
the HTML Request. Then, the server responds and we get

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.900
the Response event. From there, the HTML is streaming in

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.820
and the parse is processing each chunk, by following the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.815
same steps we just described. Tokenizing the data, converting tokens

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.669
into nodes, and building a [UNKNOWN].

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.050
&gt;&gt; Hm. Nice. So the timeline gives us a pretty low

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.320
level view into what the browser's doing as it loads a page.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.030
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. And it can be a bit overwhelming at first. There's a lot of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.020
different events in here. But don't worry, we're

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.560
going to cover most of them. That said, I think

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.731
it's a good idea for you to just try and record a few different traces on, on

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:48.990
your own. Pick a couple of favorite sites,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.030
record a few traces. See if you can spot

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.410
some interesting patterns. Once you're done,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.983
click this checkbox, to hit continue.
