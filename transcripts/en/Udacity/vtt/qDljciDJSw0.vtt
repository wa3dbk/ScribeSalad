00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.210
Now that we understand the components of RPC

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.540
latency, let's understand the sources of overhead that creeps

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.530
in in carrying out all the different functions, going

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.330
from the client to the server and back to

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.400
the client. So far as the client is

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.660
concerned, this looks like an innocuous procedure call, right?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.580
So it just says, I want to call a

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.040
procedure S.foo, and here are the arguments. Well unfortunately,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.610
this call is not a simple procedure call but

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.680
it is a remote procedure call. And the sources

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.810
of overhead that creeps in, in a remote procedure

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.680
call, are marshaling, data copying, control transfer and protocol

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.600
processing. So we'll look at each one of these

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.120
things in more detail. Now how can we reduce

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.240
the overhead in the kernel? What we want to

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.170
do is, think what the hardware gives you in order

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.150
to reduce the latency incurred for each of these components of the RPC latency.
