00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.380
At the end of this unit,

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.970
you'll do a project on building
a model that fits some data.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.750
We'll give you some real world data and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.580
you'll construct a model
that describes it.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.680
And then you'll make a case for your
model as a good summary, a useful tool,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.480
for understanding that data.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.860
You'll then use that model to make
predictions about the future.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.810
You'll use it to see, what is this
data going to look like in the future?

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.770
What are the incoming observations we
would expect to see based on what we've

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.170
seen in the past?

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.260
And by doing so you'll have a project in
your portfolio that demonstrates that

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.970
you know now how to build
a model of some data and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.580
then validate it according
to some metrics.
