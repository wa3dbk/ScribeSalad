As Susan said, it's important for us to start with, what is a drug? Here, I'm

00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:07.712
going to show you a list of different things and I want you to check which of

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:12.858
them you think is considered a drug. If heroin or black tea, coffee,

00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:18.903
antidepressants, some types of mushrooms, like those considered to be magic

00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:26.871
mushrooms. Or pain killers, MDMA, nicotine, alcohol, LSD, aspirin, mescaline,

00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:33.162
which is a hallucinogen, or marijuana, cocaine? Check as many or as few as you

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:34.020
would like.
