00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now it's time to compute the mass of the moon.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We know that the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the moon

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is about 1/6 of that of the earth or 1.67 m/s² to be precise.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We know the radius of the moon, which is 1.737 x 10⁶ m.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now you can compute its mass.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Enter a number with one decimal place in this first text field

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.293
and an integer number in the second.
