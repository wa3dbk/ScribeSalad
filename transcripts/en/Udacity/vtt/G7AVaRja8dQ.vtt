00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.608
Starting out with our function, f of x equals 2x minus 3 over 5. I've gone

00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:08.109
through the same steps that you've become very familiar with during this

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.490
lesson. First, I switched from f of x to y to make a notation easier to handle.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.852
Then, to switch to the inverse function, I interchanged x and y. So instead, we

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:24.740
have the function, x equals 2y minus 3 over 5. Then I went through a few stuffs

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.673
to solves for y. Getting y by itself on one side gave is the equation 5x plus 3

00:00:29.673 --> 00:00:35.375
over 2 equals y. Then I just switched the two sides of the equation and changed

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:42.130
y to f inverse of x. That gives us a final equation of f inverse of x equals 5x

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.434
plus 3 over 2. Let's double check that this is the right answer. Remember, we

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:52.430
can do that by looking at the composition of f inverse and f and the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.986
composition of f and f inverse. f of f inverse affects is 2 times the quantity

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:07.344
5x plus 3 over 2 minus 3, all over 5. Let's simplify this and sure enough, we

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:12.185
end up with x. Let's try the composition, the other way around. For f inverse

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:20.530
of f of x, we have 5 times the quantity 2x minus 3 over 5, plus 3 all over 2.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.177
And sure enough, cleaning this up, we get x as well. We've now verified that f

00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:30.634
inverse of x really is this expression. 5x plus 3 over 2. I hope at this point

00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:34.583
you feel really comfortable finding the inverses of different functions. And

00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:39.082
then checking that they actually are their inverses. Remember this also means

00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:43.674
that not only is 5x plus 3 over 2 the inverse of 2x minus 3 over 5, but 2x

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:51.160
minus 3 over 5 is also the inverse of this function. They're inverses of one

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.824
another. It's a two-way relationship.
