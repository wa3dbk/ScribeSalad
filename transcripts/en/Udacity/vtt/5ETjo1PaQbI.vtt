00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.090
So the next thing I want to do is I want to show some

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.120
text reading recording in progress.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.980
And I want this text to show up right here,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.220
right underneath the microphone button.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.330
To do this, I will go back to the standard editor.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.370
There I see my storyboard and then I will slide out the utility area.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.382
Let me center my storyboard.

00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:24.840
There.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.420
Now in here, I'm looking for something called a label.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.430
Let me actually go back to the list view to see what it does.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.240
There it is.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.370
It says, A label is a variable sized amount of static text,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.240
which is exactly what we need.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm going to drag this label and place it right underneath my microphone button.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.910
There.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.610
Let me change its text to recording and then reposition it.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.550
There.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.120
Now, while the label is selected, I will go to the Attributes Inspector, and

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.670
then begin to change a whole bunch of things about this label.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.170
For instance, I can change its font.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.530
I can pick a custom font.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.360
This is the font I like.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.850
I can reduce the font size, can make the label central lined.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.246
I can also change its color.

00:01:24.303 --> 00:01:26.163
And I will also go to the Editor and

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:29.230
make sure that I select the Size to Fit Content option.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.770
Let me reposition this one more time so it's right underneath the button.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.670
There.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.150
All right, I'm going to go ahead and run this and see how it looks.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.110
All right, we can see our label right here,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.420
although there seem to be a couple of things that are odd with it.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.820
One is that it is not properly aligned.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.750
It's not lined up right underneath the microphone button.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.430
Now, this happened with this microphone button also, so

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.300
we kind of know a way to fix this.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.250
And the other thing that's weird is that this label or

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.570
text is showing up by default.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.440
The correct behavior would be for

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.080
this label to show up after we have pressed the microphone button.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.940
How would you fix these issues?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.520
Here are the two things you would want to fix with this label one more time.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.980
My recommendation is that you search for

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.130
documentation and then post your responses on the discussion forum.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.520
Once you're done, select one of these two options.
