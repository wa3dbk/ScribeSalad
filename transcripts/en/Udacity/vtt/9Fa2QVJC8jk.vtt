00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Not only would I start using arbitrary debugging statements everywhere,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I would also try to debug the program into existence. Just change things until they work.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let me try. The error of this may have something to do with quotes.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So don't just simply go and remove all these extra quote checks in here.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let me see whether this makes any difference. Okay. I removed all the quote checks.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's see whether it works right now, and we run the program and see--it's foo.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The output is foo. It's almost correct. Only the quotes are missing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, now we can handle the quote--maybe we will just remove this in order to align in here,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and may be we can change things until things are proper.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Let me see whether this works. Same. Oh yeah, great. Let me see. Okay.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I can run the thing again and--however, I think I removed too much at this point

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
because if you recall our original example--the one with the greater than sign here in the target URL

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that we now still get this error in here, the quote is in here which should belong here,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which is why we introduce quote handling in the first place.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So now actually, maybe I should go back to this earlier version,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but how do I get back to the earlier version.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well, of course, I did never backup my earlier version.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I don't even know what the earlier version was. This more or less was my state of debugging.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is how I debug as a student, which was not the perfect way to do it.
