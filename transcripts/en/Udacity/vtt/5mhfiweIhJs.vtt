00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.121
&gt;From an engineering perspective,

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.678
chronic disease presents
a data logistics problem.

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:08.378
Here's a more dramatic network
depiction of the complex,

00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:12.596
highly specialist-driven care of
the chronic disease patients in

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:15.779
the typical primary care
physician's practice.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.891
As you already know, the average
multi-chronic disease patient,

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:25.830
20% of Medicare patients that drive
half of the cost is seen each

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.871
year by 14 providers who are mostly
specialists, as shown here.

00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.632
In aggregate, all of
the multi-chronic disease patients in

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:39.853
a typical PCP's practice
are seen by 86 providers.

00:00:39.853 --> 00:00:42.418
Again, mostly specialists.

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:46.794
Keep in mind that each of these
specialists mostly focuses only on

00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:51.649
the particular organ or body system
they have special knowledge of, and

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.174
are trained to treat.

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:59.900
In total, the average PCP is involved
with over 200 other providers.
