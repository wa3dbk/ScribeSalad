00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:04.682
So if you recall the value array, it is simply the non-zero elements of this input array,

00:00:04.682 --> 00:00:07.035
which we'll just fill in here.

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:14.301
The index array here is which column each of these array elements are in.

00:00:14.301 --> 00:00:18.862
So the 1 is in column 0, the 2 is in column 2,

00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:24.001
the 2 here is in column 0, the 1 here is in column 1,

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:29.507
this 1 is also in column 1, and this final 3 is in column 2.

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:35.139
Finally, what are the indices of each one of these elements that actually begins a row?

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:41.465
So we should look for the index of this 1, the index of this 2, and the index of this 1

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:44.794
because they are what begin each one of these rows.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:48.085
That's this element, this element, and this element.

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:52.789
This element is the zeroth element, this element is the second element,

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.055
and this element here is the fourth element.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:01:00.094
So this is the CSR representation of this sparse matrix here.
