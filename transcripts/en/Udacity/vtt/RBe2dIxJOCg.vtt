00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.660
That would be the function y equals 1 half to the x plus 3. We've seen before

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.752
that in order to shift a function up by three units, we need to replace y with

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:20.397
y minus 3. Doing that and then adding 3 to both sides, gives us this answer.
