00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.710
Let's take a look at more
examples of using the model.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.950
Remember that users are more
likely to download a free app

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.650
compared to a priced one.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.370
There are numbers of ways to monetize
free apps by using in app billing.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's actually two
avenues that you can take.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.810
There are objects that users
can purchase once, and

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.080
they're always able to access.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.570
So, example, something like levels,
Telltale games, Angry Birds,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.540
all allow users to unlock
new levels by paying for it.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.580
There's also objects that users will
always need to keep purchasing, coins,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.260
extra lives, boosters, gems, whatever.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410
Clash of Clans is an example of this.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.660
&gt;&gt; In this model,
the goal is to gain trust.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.020
We want to lower the entry barrier and
allow users to try us and fall in love.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.490
After that, we can offer users who
are using the product to pay for it, and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.830
they will be willing to do it with
a big smile if we are doing everything

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.680
correctly, because users will recognize
the value that we created for them.
