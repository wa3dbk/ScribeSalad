00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.190
So, so far the two operations that we've looked at have been query operations.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.119
That is, they've been asking about the values of attributes. However,

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:14.210
in interesting information systems, in addition to querying,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.209
you need to have operations that actually change the state of things.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.060
And, so this is going to be ultimately implemented with the database and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.810
you need the ability to add records, to change records, and that sort of thing.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.000
We call particular operations that don't make any changes like this pure,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.800
as in pure functions. Because they're similar to mathematical functions,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.630
which always compute the same result. Functions which are impure,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.260
are said to have side effects. And side effects might be changing the values on

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.990
the database. They might be doing IO operations, input output operations.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.390
Or flashing something on the screen that the user sees. what, whatever it is.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.060
So, those are side effects. And, so, now, as the next, next step in our,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.200
modeling of these requirements, let's try to specify a more complex situation.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.730
One where an operation actually results in a change of state. In this case, we

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.750
choose to model the actual process of checking out a Loanableitem as indicated

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.689
in requirement five. A patron can check out books or audio visual materials
