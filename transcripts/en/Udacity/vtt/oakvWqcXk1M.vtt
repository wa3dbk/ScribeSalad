00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now we're ready for a quiz where you're going to write your own "while" loop

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and you're going to do that in a procedure.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So your goal is to define a Python procedure--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we'll call it "print_numbers", with an underscore.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And it takes, as input, a positive number,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it prints out all the numbers from 1 to the input number.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, for example, if we ran "print_numbers", passing in 3,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
what should happen is it should print out the numbers: 1, 2, and 3.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So this one's going to require some thought,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but you know enough to be able to do it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You're going to have to define a procedure, you're going to have to use a "while" loop,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and you'll probably need to introduce a new variable.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So see if you can figure out how to define "print_numbers".
