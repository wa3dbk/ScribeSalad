00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
That was fairly easy.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What we need to check is simply statements that read the out variable up here,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which is down here: out=out+c and the final assertion.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We can now check whether anything else depends on

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the execution of these statements.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The only one that's in the loop is here: out=out+c,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but none of the other statements up here ret something from out.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So if you want to know how this setting affects things downstream,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the forward slice will tell you, "Well, it can only affect these 3 lines down here."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Anything else in between will not be affected by the value of out.
