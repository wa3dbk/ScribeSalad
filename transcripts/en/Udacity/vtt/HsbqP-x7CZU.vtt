00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:22.990
My name's Keith Smiley and
I am an iOS Engineer at Lyft.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.498
I work on our iOS Platform Team so I
work on a lot of the infrastructure and

00:00:27.498 --> 00:00:29.392
architecture of the iOS app.

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:39.496
[MUSIC]

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:43.164
We decided to rewrite the Lyft app
in Swift for a lot of reasons.

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:47.436
One of which was that as a team we were
extremely excited about the future of

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:52.390
iOS development with Swift,
and another big portion was

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.270
the code base that we were working in
that existed from the beginning at Lyft

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.240
wasn't the best as we
continued scaling the team.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.650
It worked really well to
get Lyft off the ground and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.850
to where it was when I joined, but
it became immediately apparent as our

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:15.019
team grew from three to ten people, that
it wasn't going to be productive for

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:17.879
us to work day to day in the code base.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:19.519
So that was a huge portion of it.

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:24.009
I think making the decision
to do a Swift re-write is

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.680
definitely a big thing that you
really have to consider a lot of

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.020
angles because it can be
extremely risky for the company,

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:33.949
if your app is already 100,000 lines
of code in Objective C or something,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.620
just deciding to rewrite it
isn't the easiest thing to do.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.650
So, we were extremely lucky
to get off the ground and

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.530
be successful with the rewrite whereas
a lot of times when you hear about

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.269
all out rewrites you hear about them
in more of a negative light and

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:53.479
I think it's just extremely lucky that
ours worked out the way that it did.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.120
I don't think there were too many
specific features that they gave

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.540
us a lot of trouble.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.900
Whenever we had to interrupt with
some third party Objective-C library,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.180
we ran into some issues
there in the early days.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.110
But we weren't really using
the old implementation

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.910
as kind of a reference
implementation for the rewrite.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.419
So, we kind of leaned on our QA team a
lot to be able to tell us how something

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.409
should work as opposed to just
looking at the old code and

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.520
trying to reason about it,
which I think helps a lot.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.185
So we were kind of,
instead of looking at how it was and

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:28.520
just redoing it in the same way,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.909
we were totally rethinking how it was
written the first time and how we could

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.250
rewrite it now to be better since we
knew more about the problems today.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.765
The benefits of rewriting our app
in Swift were pretty massive.

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:43.509
Our app is 100% Swift,
we have no first party Objective-C code.

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.629
Although of course we do rely on
a lot of third party libraries

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.849
that are still written in Objective-C.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.799
Some of the issues that we've ran into
with the third party code has mostly

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.060
been because the third party
libraries haven't been annotated for

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.340
whether a type is optional or not,
when it's being imported into Swift.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.724
And, because of that, if we guessed
wrong about whether it was optional or

00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:05.375
not the app could crash at run time.

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:08.935
So instead,
when we run into those cases we kind of

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:12.295
treat everything as optional and just
have to deal with that in Swift, but

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:14.484
at least we know we're
not going to crash.

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:17.911
I think that the community is doing
a great job of convincing the objective

00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:21.299
seed developers to add null-ability
limitations to their libraries.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.625
Mainly because Swift has become so
pervasive that people keep asking for it

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:28.290
on all of these popular libraries that
were originally written in Objective-C.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.539
[MUSIC]

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.462
I pretty rarely find myself reading and
writing Objective-C,

00:03:38.462 --> 00:03:40.530
definitely reading it
more than writing it.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.370
Of course lots of stuff like
historical stack overflow questions and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.810
stuff like that is still
all written in Objective-C.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.729
And like I said, we do depend on
a lot of third party libraries

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.000
that are written in Objective-C and

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.960
often we need to dive into them to
try to find the source of a bug.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.760
I don't really miss
anything Objective-C.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:59.560
I didn't absolutely hate it
before Swift came around, but

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.569
once you really work on an all Swift
app like ours where you can use

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.739
all the Swift features as
soon as they're released,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.210
without having to worry about
interop issues it's really freeing.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.115
I think it's going to be a long
time before Swift entirely replaces

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:19.079
Objective-C, mainly because there's so
much Objective-C code out there already.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.436
Not only third party apps, but also all
of the first party, like the iOS STK

00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:29.939
itself, or all of iOS presumably
is written in Objective-C as well.

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:33.848
So I think that even if the third party
developers all switched to only using

00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:38.254
Swift, Apple's going to have to continue
maintaining Objective-C for a long time,

00:04:38.254 --> 00:04:39.513
just for their own use.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:46.944
[MUSIC]

00:04:46.944 --> 00:04:50.510
When we're hiring a developer for the
Lyft iOS team I think one of the most

00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.497
important things is your
collaboration skills, whether or

00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:57.400
not we think that we'd be able to work
with you day to day on a feature.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:59.899
Another big thing that I
don't think always comes up

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:03.319
in the iOS community is a general
acumen for software engineering.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.600
Not particularly,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.640
how do you write different sorting
algorithms from scratch or something,

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.669
but at least being able to think about
high level architecture of problems.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.300
So that when you go to implement a new
feature you can identify places that

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.850
need to be improved, or rewritten
entirely depending on the case.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.780
When we're hiring developers
to work on our entirely Swift

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.639
app we kind of expect them to have
some background in Objective-C

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.240
just because that's been
the norm up to now.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.269
But that's not a huge requirement for
us anymore.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:40.209
As long as you have a very good
understanding of the iOS STK in general

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:44.909
and then some of the gotchus around the
platform such as memory management which

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.935
was more painfully obvious in
Objective-C than it is in Swift,

00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:52.098
then you totally have the skills
to be productive on our team.

00:05:52.098 --> 00:05:57.129
I think for developers who are starting
the iOS community having only

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.029
really written Swift,
it is still important to at least

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:04.569
spend some time knowing that you can
read Objective-C here if you need to,

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.980
become at least familiar
with the syntax.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.740
And once you've learned Swift and
the iOS STK in general,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.069
it should be pretty easy to pick
up within some amount of time.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.111
And hopefully you can find a position
where you don't have to write

00:06:18.112 --> 00:06:18.771
it full time.

00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:21.600
But with many companies now,
that's not entirely

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.758
the case because lots of companies
have some Swift and some Objective-C.

00:06:25.757 --> 00:06:28.342
So it might still be useful
to be able to write it.

00:06:28.343 --> 00:06:38.343
