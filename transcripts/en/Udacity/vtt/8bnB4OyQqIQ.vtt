00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.620
What is a software design pattern?

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.560
A design pattern is a solution to a problem in context.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.200
According to GOF, this amounts to a description of communicating objects and

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.210
classes that are customized to solve a general design problem

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.870
in a particular context.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.730
Thus, design patterns are a means of capturing and reusing design knowledge.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.150
We'll look first at an example of a particular simple pattern called

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.010
the composite pattern.
