00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.347
So here we were given a version of a JavaScript

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:05.779
interpreter that has a bug already in it. If we go

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.808
down to the part of the JavaScript interpreter,

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:13.405
that handles calling functions, we can run this

00:00:13.405 --> 00:00:16.945
sampler web page and discover that what the

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:19.507
correct answer is, three and four has actually

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:22.637
becomes 888 and 999. As it turns out, this very

00:00:22.637 --> 00:00:26.803
wrong answer is caused by a very simple bug.

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:29.051
Hopefully you ran a few of your own text cases

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:31.176
to narrow down the problem, but right here on

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:34.133
this line is the culprit. Our new environment –

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.616
the environment in which we evaluate the

00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:39.503
statements of the function body, is the ENV

00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:43.360
variable which comes from the call, ends the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.365
value passed into ENV is actually environment

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:49.797
from which we call the function. If you recall

00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:54.265
the parsing for our JavaScript functions, the first

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:56.882
element of the tuple is the strength function

00:00:56.882 --> 00:00:59.894
which says that this represents a function. The

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:02.483
second is the parameters for the function. We

00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:04.631
then have the function body what is just a

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.886
sequence of statements and then lastly we have

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:09.641
the environment for the function. This is the

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:12.390
parent from which the function was defined and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.932
it’s actually environment in which we’re

00:01:14.932 --> 00:01:15.943
supposed to executive the function. However,

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.908
with this code that’s not the case. We’re

00:01:17.908 --> 00:01:19.865
executing the function; the environment from

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:22.128
what we call it, not from what it was defined. So

00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:24.169
we need to fix that.

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:26.860
So I’ve defined a variable function environment,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.904
which just grabs the fourth element or the third

00:01:29.904 --> 00:01:33.082
index out of the tuple and instead of creating the

00:01:33.082 --> 00:01:38.493
new environment as ENV, which is going to be

00:01:38.493 --> 00:01:41.050
the function environment that we want. And

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.701
that’s it. The consequences of the bug are pretty

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:46.398
severe, but it’s really just what do we change,

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:49.822
10 characters, I mean, that’s just how these bugs

00:01:49.822 --> 00:01:52.287
can be. It can be really hard to find that’s why

00:01:52.287 --> 00:01:54.743
finding bugs is time consuming, difficult and

00:01:54.743 --> 00:01:57.001
it’s a skill that you’re going to have to learn

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.543
because its just part of programming, you’re

00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:01.051
going to make mistakes.
