00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.457
So, how do we see anything? Well, clearly, we use our eyes. But let's talk a bit

00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:08.756
more about that. Light travels through the pupil, through the eyes interior. It

00:00:08.756 --> 00:00:12.987
makes contact with the retina in the rear which is covered with rods and cones.

00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:16.347
The rods are for low level lighting, such as during night time, and also for

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:20.300
peripheral vision and motion detection. The cones provide us with core vision.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.716
The key idea here is, light coming from a particular direction is detected by

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:28.864
cones in a particular spot in the eye. This description barely touches on the

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:33.168
complexity of the eye. The iris around the pupil opens and closes to let more or

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:37.421
less light in. The back of the eye is a curved surface. The density of cones is

00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:41.497
highest tin the fovea. Which is where our eyes focus for reading or other

00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:44.600
activities. And we haven't even touched on what happens to these signals when

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.883
they're processed by the brain.
