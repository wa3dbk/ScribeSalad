00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.388
The x intercepts would be 2,0 and negative 2, 0. Great solving if you found

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:11.858
those two. Remember for an x intercept, we're somewhere along our x axis, which

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:18.080
means the y value must equal 0. So we plug in zero for the value of y, and then

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.300
we can continue solving for x. Here we have x squared divided by 4 equals 1. So

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.450
we're multiplying both sides by 4 to clear the fraction and then we'll have x

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.619
squared equals 4. We'll take the square root of both sides, indicating plus or

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.215
minus, so x can equal positive 2 or negative 2. Keep in mind that x intercepts

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:43.693
are points, so we need to write the coordinates of the x intercepts. We'll have

00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:48.920
positive 2,0 and negative 2,0. Both the coordinates written in parentheses.
