00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The example we just saw using Csmith to test C compilers represented several years of work

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
by my group--it's really sort of a large effort for us.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What I want to show now is a different example of random testing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're going to test the tiny UNIX utility function using the very tiny random tester.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And so if you remember a couple of units ago we talked about the UNIX read system call,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so let's look at the read system call works.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Before I get going into this example, I should apologize a bit for dropping in to see here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I try to work this example into Python and it really just didn't come out right--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
there just didn't feel right and it sort of inherently a C example.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So it's not going to matter if you don't know C or shouldn't like C--I'll go through the code.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Really it would be rather simple.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The UNIX read system call as called from the C program tips the arguments.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It takes fd which is a file descriptor, it takes a buf which is a 0.02, a block of memory

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
into which data going to be read, and it takes a number of bytes to read from the file

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
represented by the file descriptor into the memory blocked pointed to by buf.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And now usually what the read system call does is it reads the number of bytes that you expected

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
into the memory block that you provided and all was good.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The return value of read is going to be the number of bytes read,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
so that's what usually happens, but there a couple of other things that can happen.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
A second possibility is the read system call then returns 0,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
indicating that you've reached the end of the file.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Another thing that can happen is it can return -1 if it failed.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But the fourth possibility and this is the one that sort of pernicious and its one that a lot of programmers

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
get wrong is that read can return the number of bytes less than the number you asked for

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and this isn't a failure--this just doesn't represent any sort of out of memory condition

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
or end of file or anything like that--it just means we need to try again.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And so the little UNIX utility function that I'm going to test here is a different version of read.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's a version of read called read all that acts just like read except that it' not going to have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
this property of returning partial reads ever.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So what read always going to do is in the case of a partial read is going to just issue another read call

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that picks up where the first call left off and it's going to repeatedly do that until the read is

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
complete or until some sort of an error or end of file condition occurs.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So if anything bad happens, it will just return a -1 value

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which is the sort of standard UNIX error value.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If the read calls a succeeding but returning a partial results, we're just going to keep issuing

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
read calls until we're finished, and so let's look at the code that does this.
