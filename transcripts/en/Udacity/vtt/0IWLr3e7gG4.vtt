00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.700
So what do I mean by the cross-correlation method?

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.460
In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.570
different waveforms as a function of the time-lag applied to one of them.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.450
What that basically means is that I have two different signals, two different

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.280
waveforms, and I want to combine them to figure out what are the best ways that

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.060
I can correlate the two different signals together, and allow me to kind of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.100
do things, of measuring the similarity between those signals.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.380
We will look at that for a variety of reasons when we get into feature

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.170
detection and stuff in the later lectures, but this is an important part of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.690
what we want to actually look at a little bit more carefully now.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.420
And then actually we'll use that to develop other concepts.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.010
Another way of looking at the cross-correlation is also considering it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.010
as a sliding dot product, or an inner-product of two different signals.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.210
And you witness this when we actually look at a smaller kernel and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.530
we slid it over a bigger image and actually computed at the center, or

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.190
a representative point, the output which was the combination, or

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.080
an inert dot product of those two signals.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.900
And that's an important part on how the process unfolded as we looked at

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.810
how we did the processing or filtering in the last lecture.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.600
Mathematical notation of cross-correlation is shown here.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.720
Again, we are using the two summations and

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.930
looping over the whole image here with non-uniform attribute weights.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.700
Mathematically, we will denote this by symbol here,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.840
where basically the kernel h is being cross-correlated with the out,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.920
input signal, F, to generate an output G.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.040
So what do we mean when we say now, we are filtering an image?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.870
What we mean by filtering an image here is,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.050
what we are doing is replacing each pixel in the output with

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.390
a linear combination of its neighbors with a kernel matrix.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.160
And for each one of them, there is a kernel or a mask signal, h here.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.090
And basically that is a prescription, a function

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.330
of weights which is applied as a linear combination to generate an output G.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.508
And we saw this as I rubbed over,

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:14.820
again h over the input image F to generate the output G, earlier.
