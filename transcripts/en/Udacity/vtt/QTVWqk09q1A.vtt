00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.927
You've seen that in the normal distribution, by knowing where on the x axis the

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:11.842
value falls, in terms of standard deviation, we can determine the percentage

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:17.722
less than or greater than any value. In this lesson you are going to calculate

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:23.471
these percentages. Remember that we used theoretical curve to model the data and

00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:28.511
the area under this curve is one, that's because it models with relative

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:33.769
frequency of a distribution of data in terms of proportions. This curve is

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.775
called the probability density function which we often abbreviate PDF.
