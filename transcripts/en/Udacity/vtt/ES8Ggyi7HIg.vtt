00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.620
A discrimination tree is
a knowledge structure,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.440
in which the cases themselves
are the leaf nodes of the tree.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.000
At the root node, and at all
the intimated nodes are questions.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.920
The questions of the root node and
the intimidated node pertain

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.040
to the pertain to the indexical
structures of the cases.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.090
So recall that,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.500
we were using the origins of the cases
as the index equal structure.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.401
Let's stay with that point
just a while longer.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:33.113
So now I might have a question that the
root node which says is the origin not

00:00:33.113 --> 00:00:33.647
of 5N?

00:00:33.647 --> 00:00:37.950
If the answer to that question is yes,
then it brings us to this branch.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.170
If the answer is no,
it takes us to the other branch.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.540
At this node I might ask,
is the origin east of 5 of E?

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.750
If yes, it brings us to this branch.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.810
If no, it brings us to that branch.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.360
In this way we are able to
discriminate between C and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.460
A, in fact we able to disconnect
with C not all of the cases.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.059
Similarly for this part of the graph.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.847
So now that we have learned,

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:04.498
what is the knowledge structure
discrimination trees for

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:09.352
organization the case memory, let us now
look at how will we store a new case.

00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:13.803
How will we incrementally learn this
knowledge structure as new cases are put

00:01:13.803 --> 00:01:15.670
into the case library?

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.710
Imagine that there is a new case, X.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.820
So we can navigate this tree using X.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.510
Is the origin of X North of 5 of A?

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.400
Yes it is.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.370
So we come to this branch.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.660
Is the origin of X East of 5 of E?

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.280
No it is not, so we come to this branch.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.770
But now we have a problem.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.470
Both A and X, have the same
answer no to this question.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.510
We must find a way of
discriminating between A and X, so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.440
we'll add a new question here.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.250
Perhaps we can add a new question.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.980
Is the origin East of 3 of E?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.740
In the case of X, the answer is yes.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.680
In the case of A, the answer is no.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.270
That's why adding a right
node at the right place,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.630
we have found a way of
discriminating between X and A.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.000
This now is a modified
discrimination tree.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.210
Each time we add a location to memory,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.199
the organization of
the case of memory changes.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.508
This is an example of
incremental learning,

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:15.540
with the addition of each case some
new knowledge structure is learned.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.480
We learn more about incremental
learning in the next lesson.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.330
&gt;&gt; So going back to our programming
example, we were dealing with cases

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.520
of file input, and we could use
the same indexical structure

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.210
according to which we organize our cases
to now design a discrimination tree.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.240
At the very top level I would probably
ask, what language is the casing?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.808
Is it in Java, C++, Python?

00:02:35.808 --> 00:02:39.880
Now the discrimination trees don't have
to be binary like they are right here.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.030
We can have more than
two answers coming out.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.680
So at the top level, I could have
a question of what language is the case

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.010
in, and the branches could be JAVA,
C++, and Python, and so on.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.420
I could similarly have questions about,
is it an efficient solution, is it for

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.760
a big problem or a small problem,
is it for my personal use or is it for

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.480
consumer use, and so on until I get
down to individual cases that represent

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.810
different things I might want to
consider when I'm doing a new solution.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.468
&gt;&gt; David a point you make about this
not being a but a very important one.

00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:15.210
Let's go back to our original example,
where we had a micro world of blocks and

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.040
the blocks had different colors.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.296
So I can ask a question at the root
node, what is the color of the block?

00:03:20.296 --> 00:03:23.129
And have a large number of branches
coming out of it corresponding

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.116
to different colors.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:28.061
Here's an example of a discrimination
tree, not a binary print.
