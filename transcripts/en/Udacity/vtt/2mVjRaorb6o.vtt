00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
So here's an idea.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's get rid of this line, and instead, let's declare that n_ary is a decorator.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We'll write a definition of what it means to be a decorator in terms of updating wrappers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then we'll be done, and we've done it once and for all.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can apply it to n_ary, and we can apply it to any other decorator that we define.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is starting to get a little bit confusing because here we're trying to define decorator,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and decorator is a decorator.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Have we gone too far into recursion? Is that going to bottom out?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's draw some pictures and try to make sense of it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we've defined n_ary, and we've declared that as being a decorator,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and that's the same as saying n_ary = decorator of n_ary.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then we've used n_ary as a decorator.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We've defined sequence to be an n_ary function.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's the same as saying sequence = n_ary of sequence.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now we wanted to make sure that there's an update so that the documentation

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and the name of sequence gets copied over.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We want to take it from this function, pass it over to this function

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
because that's the one we're going to keep.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
While we're at it, we might as well do it for n_ary as well.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We want to have the name of n_ary be n_ary and not something arbitrary

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that came out of decorator.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So we've got 2 updates that we want to do for the function that we decorated

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and for the decorator itself.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Now let's see if we can write decorator so that it does those 2 updates.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So let's define decorator. It takes an argument (d), which is a function.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Then we'll call the function we're going to return _d,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and that takes a function as input.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So it returns the update wrapper from applying the decorator to the function

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and copying over onto that decorated function, the contents of the original function's

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
documentation and name, and then we also want to update the wrapper

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
for the decorator itself.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So from (d) the decorated function, we want to copy that over into _d

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and then return _d.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now which update is which?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, this one here is the update of _d with d,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and this one is the update of the decorated function from the function.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So here we're saying the new n_ary that we're defining gets the name from the old n_ary,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the name in the documentation string,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and here we're saying the new sequence, the new n_ary sequence,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
gets its name from the old sequence.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Here's what it all looks like.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If you didn't quite follow that the first time, don't worry about it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
This is probably the most confusing thing in the entire class because we've got functions

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
pointing to other functions, pointing to other functions.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Try to follow the pictures. If you can't follow the pictures, that's okay.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Just type it into the interpreter. Put these definitions in.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Decorate some functions. Decorate some n_ary functions.

00:03:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Take a look at them and see how it works.
