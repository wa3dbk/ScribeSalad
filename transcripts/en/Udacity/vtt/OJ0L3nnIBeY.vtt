00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.040
We're now going to look at the confusion matrix.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.010
It is important to know that selecting a model is dependent on

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.100
the problem being considered and the application of the model.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.650
Often for

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.740
practical problems, we're interested in measures other than just accuracy.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.630
Let us consider a kind of contrived example.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.530
We have many bottles of wine, where some are poisoned.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.290
In this case,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.020
it is important that we always catch the bottles of wine that are poisoned.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.830
So labeling a good bottle of wine as poisoned, which is a false negative,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.980
implies some wasted wine.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.590
However, labeling a poisoned bottle as good,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.960
which is a false negative, can imply a far dangerous mistake.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.280
So, in this case, we can sacrifice accuracy for some other measure where we give

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.050
a lot more value at minimizing the false negatives versus the false positives.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.850
Here is a quick quiz.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.590
Give an example of a classification problem where the cost of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.320
a false positive outweighs the cost of a false negative.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.440
