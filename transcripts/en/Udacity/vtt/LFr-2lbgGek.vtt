00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.680
Welcome to the wonderful
world of Location-Aware apps.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.410
In this lesson, you learn the basics
of using location services,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.060
including the most parts of setting
it up for use in your app and

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.790
also how to optimize for battery use.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.630
In the next lesson, you'll work through
a simple sample that gets some of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.370
the useful date from location services
that go beyond latitude and longitude.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.700
You can use the techniques that you will
learn to get cool stuff like altitude,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.610
bearing, and speed.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.380
You'll see more about how location
services give intelligence,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.740
such as getting the address
at your current location.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.878
These are the beginnings
of understanding context,

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:41.015
which will then give you
the ability to do cool stuff,

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.814
depending on where your
device is in the world.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:45.650
Are you ready to get started?

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.160
Let's go.
