00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.100
Let's look at how we can use
HTML headings effectively

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.820
to recreate the experience
we saw in Victor's video.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.350
First I'd like to reiterate Rob's
point that DOM order matters,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.340
which is also item 1.3.2
on the webbing checklist.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.850
Rob showed how it matters for
focus order, but it also matters for

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.300
the order read by the screen reader.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.360
In Victor's demo, you might have
noticed how the heading list

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.210
followed the DOM order and
not the visual order of the page.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.470
That is actually true for
screen readers in general.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.360
Since the screen reader,
like any assistive technology,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.650
is interacting with
the accessibility tree,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.230
which is based directly on the DOM tree,
the order a screen reader is going to

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.180
perceive will be directly
based on the DOM order.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.080
Think of the page as perceived
by desktop screen reader uses at

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.520
almost losing its second dimension.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.020
It's all serialized into
a single stream of content.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.200
I can use a little snippet of
JavaScript which you can copy from

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.980
the instructor notes to list out
the headings in the console.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.900
I can use a little snippet of
JavaScript, which you can copy from

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.160
the instructor notes,
to list out the headings in the console.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.300
We have one H1 in this list,
telling us the page's main topic.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.960
This is also echoed in
the page's title in the header.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.360
So when switching tabs or windows,
users know what page they're on.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.810
Then we have a series of H2s.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.570
Which include both page
structure things like contents,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.930
as well as article sections.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.407
Between some of those H2's, we also
have H3's indicating subsections.

00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:33.780
Some of these are in
the article contents, but

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.720
some are also in
the surrounding page contents.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.080
Within navigation menu there are things
like personal tools and languages.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.090
This page only goes down to H3, but we
do have built in heading tags going all

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.490
the way down to H6 for
very complex or long documents.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.546
Using headings to lay out page structure
like this is mentioned in several

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.948
web aim checklist items.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:02:00.800
2.4.10 states individual sections of
content are designated using headings

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.710
where appropriate.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.025
1.3.1 mentions semantic markup is
used to designate headings age one.

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:11.400
2.4.1 mentions heading structure
as a sufficient technique for

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.430
bypassing blocks of content.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.960
And 2.4.6 discusses some details for
writing useful headings.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.210
If you are really watching closely,
Ella, you might have noticed

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.460
that not all of these headings
are visible on the screen.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.650
Wikipedia is using a technique where
they place some headings off screen to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.030
make them visible only to screen reader
uses and other assistive technology.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.470
For complex applications, this can be
a good way to accommodate headings when

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.250
the visual design doesn't require or
even have room for a visible heading.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.570
However, it's important not to go
overboard with this technique.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.530
Remember that assistive technology users
may well be able to see the screen.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.250
So going too far down the path of
creating screen reader only content,

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.850
can actually create a worse
user experience for some users.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.670
Besides which, it can create
a maintenance headache when it comes to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.020
things like internationalization.
