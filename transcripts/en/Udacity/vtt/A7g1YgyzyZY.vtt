00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.950
One model is the so-called
Passthrough Model.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.328
The way the pass through model
works is that the VMM level driver

00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:12.129
is responsible for configuring
the access permissions for device.

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.852
For instance, it will allow a Guest VM
to have access to the memory where

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:20.250
the control registers for
the device are.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.302
There are clearly benefits to this
approach, one is for instance,

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:28.370
that the guest VM has exclusive
access to a particular device.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.633
It's the only one that can manipulate
its state, it can control it and

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.810
it's the only one that will use it.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.702
Also, the VM's accesses to the device
completely bypass the hypervisor, so

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:42.309
there are direct accesses to the device.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.990
This model is also called
the VMM bypass model.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.190
Now clearly, once we start providing
VMs with exclusive access,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.950
figuring out a way to share
devices will become difficult.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.368
Well, basically have to
continuously reassign,

00:00:56.368 --> 00:01:01.059
which particular VM it can access
a particular device over time.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.750
But the sharing will not happen
simultaneously, concurrently.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.681
That in some cases is,
is really not doable,

00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:10.470
because of the limitations
of the device.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.110
In other cases, it can be done, but it
will be very high overhead operations.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.990
So, in practice really device sharing
with this model is not feasible.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.563
Now because the hypervisor is
completely out of the way,

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:29.029
it means that the Guest VM and the
Device Driver that's in the Guest VM,

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:33.210
directly operates and
controls the particular physical device.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.471
So that means that when we're launching
this Guest VM, there better be a device

00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:43.350
of the exact same type as expected by
the Guest OS on the physical machine.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.705
In some cases, maybe in the server space
that's not as critical of a requirement

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:52.010
just because there are fewer types of
devices that are commonly present there.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.969
But in other environments, this is
really not a practical constraint.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.374
Remember, we're not talking about
the fact that there needs to be

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:04.950
a network interface, or
a disk device or hard disk device.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.566
We're talking about the exact same,
particular type of network card or

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.441
hard disk drive that
the Guest VM expects

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:15.330
depending on the device
drivers that it has.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.033
Also, we mentioned that one of
the benefits of virtualization is that

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:22.250
the Guest VM started decouples
from the physical hardware.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.109
And therefore, we can migrate them
easily to other nodes in the system.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.818
Well, this pass through really
breaks that decoupling,

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:32.550
because it directly
binds a device to a VM.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.551
This makes migration
difficult in particular,

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.989
because there may be some
device specific state and

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.673
potentially even device resident state
that would also need to be copied and

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:48.137
migrated and then properly configured
at the destination mount and then

00:02:48.137 --> 00:02:53.209
basically that turns VM migration not in
a hyperviser and VM specific operation.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.935
But it needs to be implemented in a way
that knows how to deal with the device

00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:02.140
specifics of all of the particular
devices that are of interest.
