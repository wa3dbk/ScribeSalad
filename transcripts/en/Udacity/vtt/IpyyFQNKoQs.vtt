00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.589
We will now turn our attention to

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.550
the Datastore Commit Process. This process describes

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.890
to consistency rules for storing data. Datastore

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.280
has two consistency models, Eventual Consistency and Strong

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.850
Consistency. Let's look at these in more

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.790
detail. In this use case diagram we have

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.030
three things. Your Application, the datastore API

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.300
that your application calls and the datastore backend,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.660
which performs work that your application is not involved

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.790
in. When your application wants to store an entity,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.860
it performs a put operation towards the datastore API.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.740
The datastore backend then writes this entity to a

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.940
log. When the write is completed, control is turned

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.080
back to your application. At this point the Datastore

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.790
backend has promised to write the entity to Datastore.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.720
Observe however that the entity has not been written yet.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.280
It has only been written to a log.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.890
The Datastore backend now goes through to work to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.360
make everything consistent. It does this by using the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.440
login information to update the entity storage and then

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.920
it updates all the indexes. So observe that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.270
when control is returned to your application, datastore may

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.310
not have done all the work required for the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.170
data to be updated. Is this good or bad?

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.540
Well it's good, because this means that you have

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.230
less latency in your application. But the question now

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.800
becomes, what happens if a query is issued that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.870
would retrieve the data your application just requested to

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.850
put into data store? Well, with eventual consistency the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.220
data store API will not wait for this to

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.960
happen. So it only considers matching data that already

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.730
exists. That is data, that was already in data store

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.840
prior to your put call. And then it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.730
returns that result. That's why it's called eventual

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.570
consistency. Queries will be eventually consistent with put

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.070
operations performed to what's the data store API.
