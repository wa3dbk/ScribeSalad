00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What we now know is most startups fail from a lack of customers

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
than from a failure of product development and that's really interesting even in Silicon Valley

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where we would probably take more technical risk

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
per square inch or square foot than anywhere else in the world.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We go out of business typically not because we didn't deliver a product.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We go out of business, because we didn't find enough customers to pay us enough money.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That's a big idea, because if you think about it, we have all these processes

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to manage the engineering process, why?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Because that is the biggest risk in a large company,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but we had no processes to manage the customer risk.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In fact, the best we could do, in the old days, is hire a VP of sales who told you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
"Oh, I have a great Rolodex, great set of contacts."

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But we really have no formal process for searching for what customers needs are,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and in fact, we've just come up with one and that's going to be a key part of this course.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This search for the business model.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This search for the truth is called customer development,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and customer development really has two pieces, the search and its execution,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And in this class, we're going to be talking about the first two steps, customer discovery,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
customer validation, the pivots that connect them, and then a few that are lucky.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We actually get to execute your business model in customer creation and company building.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The other piece that goes with the process in a startup

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
is now in a customer development process but in agile engineering process.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
One example is extreme programing or XP, which basically

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
is built around this idea of iteration and incremental delivery of the product.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This is a big idea; it says instead of building every possible feature on day one,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we're actually going to incrementally and iteratively interact with customers,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
test each portion of the product, and see if what we're building

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
actually has a home outside the building.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So what this really means is that for process instead of just going to execution first,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
hiring product managers, doing waterfall development, or maybe even agile nowadays,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
we're actually going to start with a customer development process

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
coupled with some kind of agile engineering process.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Which one you pick? How to use XP as an example?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But it could be whatever your favorite process is, and by the way,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
don't only think that agile engineering and agile development is about software.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Toyota and the Toyota production system actually have it for a hardware of decade before anybody

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in software who ever thought about it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So you could be building products anything from microprocessors to medical equipment

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to hardware, software, etc. using an iterative and incremental engineering process.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And again, once you're done with that, of course, you want to manage this in a formal process,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
but not before you do the plan.
