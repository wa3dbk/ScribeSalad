Allocate, and remember, this is based on scan; we just scan the number of neighbors.

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:07.880
In our example, we begin with the input array of 3 and 1,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.715
because vertex 1 has 3 neighbors and vertex 3 has 1 neighbor,

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:14.123
and we scan this array with an exclusive sum scan.

00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:17.189
So we get the resulting array 0, 3.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.965
Node 1 knows to start writing its edge list at offset 0.

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:24.970
Node 3 knows to start writing its edge list at offset 3.
