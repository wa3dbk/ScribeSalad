00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This homework I call "More Pour."

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We did the glass-pouring example where we had two glasses, and we could pour between them.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to do the same thing here,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
except we're going to allow an arbitrary number of glasses.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For example, here I've drawn four of them.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's say they're capacities are 1, 2, 4, and 8,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and let's say we set ourselves the goal of having 5 in one of the glass.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
How could we achieve that?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
One solution is we could fill up this glass with 8. That would be the first action.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then we could empty out or pour 1 into here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now we'd be down 1 and be at that level.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then the second action would be to pour into here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now we'd be down 2 more, and we find we're at 5 here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That would solve the problem.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
An alternative solution would be to fill these two glasses with 4 and 1

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then pour both of them into 8 to achieve 5.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Your task will be to define more<u>pour</u>problem,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which takes a tuple of capacities of glass--any number of glasses--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and then a goal, which is a single integer that you're trying to achieve.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Alternately, you can have a start state of what is the current level of the glasses are.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If the start state is None, that means zero for all of the glasses.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Your task is to return a path which achieves the goal

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
or return the empty path or failure if there is none.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The paths, like before, are an alternation between states and actions

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
where the state is just a tuple of current level, not of capacities but of current levels.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Then the actions can be either fill, empty, or pour,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and we're going to describe the glasses by their index numbers.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In this list of capacities the first number in the list--

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
we'll call that glass number 0, the next one glass number 1, and so on.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
When we filled up the tallest glass that was the last glass out of four--glass number 3--

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
so the action would have been fill 3.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Here we have a test that says the problem I just solved for you by drawing it out.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The actions are fill glass number 3.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Pour glass number 3 into glass number number 0.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Then pour glass number 3 into glass number 1, and then you're left with 5 in glass number 3.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Here are some more test cases to check things out for you,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
see if you can solve those by writing your program.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Use what we have seen before.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You'll probably want to use one of the search procedures we've already defined,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and you'll probably need to write a custom successor function,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
which understands the current state and the capacities.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Let me just say I've seen some discussion in the forums about, oh,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
can I find a one-line solution or two-line solution?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Don't worry about that. The solution will be whatever it is.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The set up to solve the problem should be a call to a function we've already defined.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
That will be one line, but the successor function--

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that might be a dozen lines, maybe a little bit more or a little bit less.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Don't worry about minimizing it. Worry about making it clear.
