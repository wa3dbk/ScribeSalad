00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:05.550
What major issue is Scalability. If you've got an interesting application,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.290
that's distributed across the internet, it might grow. That is, it might,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.265
have more users over time. Or it might have, a greater load,

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:19.390
due to the individual users. In either case,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.670
you want to be able to grow the application. And the question then is,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.240
how easy is it to grow? This is sometimes called scaling. That is,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.940
how easy is it to scale your application? Scaling typically takes the form of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.050
adding new hardware. And the question then becomes, to what extent will

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.370
adding new machines change your system architecture, or its components? Ideally,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.440
we'd like to grow transparently. What transparency means is, whether or

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.240
not a particular aspect of a systems architecture is visible externally,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.140
that is, to the, the other machines. If it's invisible, of course, you can

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.530
scale as much as you want, and the rest of the system would not be concerned.
