00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I'd like to talk about the open discussion question

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
posted in the Homework 1.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
To review, Alice wants to send a message to Bob

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
using a one-time pad to let Bob know yes or no

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
if she's going to be taking CS387, and they're worried about Mallory,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
who could possibly intercept the message and then change around the message

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so that Bob would get the wrong message.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And we saw in the question that Mallory could--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
whatever she intercepts, she can't tell whether it's yes or no,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but she can XOR it with the difference between yes and no,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and that will flip the answer and some of this suggested--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
solutions were to change yes and no to other things

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
thinking there was something special about yes and no, that those could be flipped.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But you can flip anything, and you're flipping it by XORing it with the difference.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Whatever was there was either yes or no XORed with some key.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You don't know the key, but XORing that with the difference of them

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
will cancel out the Ys, or if this was an N, it would cancel out the Ns and leave the Y.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So whatever the message was, it can be XORed with the difference.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
There's nothing special about Y or N.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It would work--let's say--if you replaced it with yes and not.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The difference is just Mallory would XOR it with the XOR of yes and not.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
All of the solutions that were ideas about changing the content

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
don't really solve anything.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Mallory knows the 2 options and can XOR them and can flip the content.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
There are some other approaches that had better success, though.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There were 2 main styles.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
For example, Steve Krenzel from Seattle suggested using

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
kind of more advanced crypto tools.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He wanted to append the nonce to the message and then hash the entire message.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, I think what he was suggesting--which is a good solution to this--

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is to take the yes or no, so you're still giving the response.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You're going to concatenate that with the nonce, which is just some random value.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We'll call it r.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is long random value.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And then concatenate that with a hash of the y,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
whatever the answer was, with the nonce.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And we haven't talked about hash functions yet in Unit 1,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but we do talk about them in Unit 2,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and a hash function is just a function that takes some input

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and maps it in a complex and unpredictable way to some other value.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And that's useful because Bob can't predict what this value is

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
without knowing what the value of r is, and if the value of r is random

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and not known to Bob, there's no way for Bob to predict the output of this hash.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
If he tries to change this, well, there's no way to change it in a way

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that knows the difference between what the result would be if this was an N

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and when it was a Y, so Bob could flip these bits,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but then the hash value wouldn't be correct.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm sorry, Mallory could flip these bits.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Then the hash value wouldn't be correct, and Bob would know that it was wrong,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
so this is a reasonable way to do it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
The difficulty with the solution is it involved cryptographic tools

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that are much more complex than just the XOR hash functions are,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
things we'll talk about in the next unit but involve a fair amount of computation.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It's not something you could easily do by hand.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
What we want is some solution that would allow Alice and Bob to do this

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
without using any more advanced cryptographic tools.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yeah, the other style solution was one proposed by StirCat,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
which involves sending a number of dashes--maybe 8 or 16 dashes in a row--

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and then randomly picking one character to set to Y or N,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and what are your thoughts on that?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
This is a really interesting idea.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We're going to take--instead of sending just one character,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
we've got a string of 8 dashes, and we're randomly going to pick one of those

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and replace it with either the Y or the N.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That's going to be the answer.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And now this means when Mallory intercepts it,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
if she doesn't know which one was randomly picked,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
well, she can XOR out the difference between a Y or N from any one of these 8,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
but if she picks the wrong one, she's going to change a dash into something else.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And I don't know what it would be. We'd have to look at the numbers.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But it's not going to be a dash anymore, and so when Bob

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
looks at the result, it's going to look wrong.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Bob will know the message was tampered with.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It's only if Mallory was lucky enough to guess the right one to flip

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that she could change the answer, and her probability of guessing it correctly

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is 1 over the number of positions here.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
If we have 8, she has a 1 in 8 chance of guessing the right one and flipping that one.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The other times when she doesn't guess correctly she'll get caught.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This is pretty good. This has a nice property.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It means if we make a message long enough, we can make Mallory's success

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
probability as low as we want, but we need a really long message.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
If we want her success to be less than 1 in 256,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
we need a string that's 256 bytes long, which is not a big deal but is less elegant.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We could get a similar property with a shorter message

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
if instead of having only one of them depend on the choice

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
we make a short message where each of the characters in the message

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
depend on the yes or no value, but Alice randomly picks

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
either to send a Y or a 1 if the answer is yes

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
or to send an N or a 0, so let's say those are the 4 choices.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
She's going to randomly pick.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
If the answer is Y, she's going to send something like YY1Y,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
randomly picking for each position whether to send a Y or a 1.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
When Mallory intercepts this,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the XOR between Y and N is different from the XOR between 1 and 0.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Those two are not equal, so for Mallory to flip an answer,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
she's got to guess whether it was a Y or an N or a 1 or a 0,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and she can guess and flip one.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
If she guesses them all correctly, then she could flip them all,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and Bob would see the wrong answer.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But if she guesses the one wrong, then Bob will see one of the characters

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
in the string doesn't match, and so now Mallory's probability

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
of guessing them all correct is ½ to the power of how many there are,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
so if there were 4 characters, it would be ½ to the 4th or 1/16,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but this is a much lower success probability than we had

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
having the string of dashes where Mallory only had to guess

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
one position correctly out of that whole length.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Now she's got to guess each position correctly with ½ chance for each time.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
This just involves Alice picking randomly,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
so we didn't need to add something beyond the one-time pad.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Alice has to be able to flip a coin or some other source of randomness

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
to decide whether to send the Y or the 1 for each of these 4 positions

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
or more positions if she wants the success probability

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to be lower than ½ to the 4th.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Could you also do a lowercase y and a t for true and a lowercase t?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
You could, yeah.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Probably what you'd have to be careful about is if you did a lowercase y and a lowercase n.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The XOR of those might be the same as the difference between

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the uppercase Y and uppercase N.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I would guess if you did true and false,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
those would be different, but you should be careful

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and know that the XOR is not the same.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But as long as the XOR is different, then each byte

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Mallory has just ½ chance of making a change in the right way.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Okay. I think that's all we have.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Cool, so thanks for joining office hours, and thanks for all the discussion.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It looked like we got a lot of good responses to open discussion questions,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
so hopefully we'll see that again in Homework 2.

00:07:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Thank you.&gt;&gt;Thanks.
