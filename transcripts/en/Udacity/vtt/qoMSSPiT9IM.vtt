00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.665
The answer is that vertical lines cannot be written in this form. Remember that

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:09.290
the slopes of vertical lines are undefined. Because as we saw earlier, when we

00:00:09.302 --> 00:00:13.665
try to calculate the change in x in order to find the slope, we end up with a

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:18.359
denominator of zero. And dividing by zero does not give us defined answers. Or

00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:22.432
in other words, answers that are numbers that we can work with. Since we can't

00:00:22.444 --> 00:00:26.309
come up with a number to represent m, we can't write vertical lines in this

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:30.414
form. Furthermore, since vertical lines are parallel to the y-axis, they will

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:34.455
never intersect it. That means that we can't find a value for b in this form of

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:38.894
the equation either. Vertical lines, therefore, do not have y intercepts, and

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:42.870
have undefined slopes. Which makes it impossible for us to write it in this form

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.925
that involves slopes and y intercept's.
