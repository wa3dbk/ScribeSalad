00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.218
Let's start out by calculating the distance between M and N, or the distance

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.303
that we're just calling MN. I'm going to take the square root of a bunch of

00:00:08.315 --> 00:00:12.449
stuff. Our x-coordinates are 11 half and 2, and when you take the distance

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:16.473
between them, then we square that. We add to this the same thing for the

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:21.525
y-coordinates. And then, we just simplify. After some more simplification, our

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:26.875
final answer is the square root of 218 divided by 2. Interestingly enough, when

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:32.225
we calculate the other's three side lengths, we get that PQ and MN have the same

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:37.629
length, and also that NP and QM m have the same length. Let's keep this in mind

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.273
for discussion slightly later on.
