00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.138
So the converse case is fairly straight forward.

00:00:03.138 --> 00:00:06.043
Now instead of checking the first against the current depth,

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:09.144
we're checking the second, and we know the first has not been visited yet.

00:00:09.144 --> 00:00:13.631
If that's the case, then we're going to set the depth of the first to the depth of the second plus 1.

00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:19.572
Now, there's 2 other cases, and 1 of those cases is if we visited both vertices,

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:22.325
and the other case is if we visited neither vertex.

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:25.009
So you should convince yourself that we could ignore these cases,

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.669
that we have no operations to do if either of these cases is true.
