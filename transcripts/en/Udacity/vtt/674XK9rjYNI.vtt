00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.580
Here are both coordinate systems with the architect's scheme in blue, Minecraft

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.217
in red. We're in luck with the x axes, in both systems we know the x axes match.

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:14.956
Whatever happens with the y and z axes won't affect the x axis value. So in the

00:00:14.956 --> 00:00:19.404
second system x will also be 10 . In the architect system, z goes up and in the

00:00:19.404 --> 00:00:24.038
mine craft system y goes up. That's simple enough. The height of the point in

00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:29.110
the architect system is 13. The height is still 13 in the mind craft system so y

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.637
will be 13. Finally in the architect system, y goes north and z goes south in

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:38.365
mind craft. The y coordinate in the architect system is 24. Since z is going in

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:45.463
the opposite direction. Z must then be negative 24. So the answer is 10, 13,

00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:47.105
negative 24.
