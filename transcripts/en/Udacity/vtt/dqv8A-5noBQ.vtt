00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.410
For this last practice problem, I want you to write these four numbers in

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.560
scientific notation. After you've written these in scientific notation, combine

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.983
the powers of 10, and list that exponent here. Good luck.
