00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.600
There are times when you would
like to provide more information

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.200
on a notification on a wearable device.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.390
In this example, we have a calendar
notification but it would be handy to

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.920
show some extra reminder notes
if the user swipes to the left.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.800
Android wear supports a concept called
pages which allow you to add extra pages

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.820
of information to
a notification like shown here.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.730
To do this, you just create
two notification objects.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.030
Here's the first page and
this is the start of the second page.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.800
And then here's the second part
of the second page where we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.600
add the style to it.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.040
And now we create a wearable extender.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.430
We use add page to add the second
notification to it and

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.130
then we call extend to add this
all to the first notification.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.860
Then issue the first notification page,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.510
and there's no need to
issue the second one.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.280
The notification will then show
up with the second page attached.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.740
And note, that any extra pages added
will never appear on the phone.
