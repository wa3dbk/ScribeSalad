00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.910
So let's see how should we do the correct out of order for

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.900
the execution. We should execute out of order. We can broadcast out of order.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.750
But we should deposit values to registers in order.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.803
This is needed because if we deposit register values out of order.

00:00:14.803 --> 00:00:17.210
If subsequently we discover that one of the earlier,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.870
the instruction shouldn't have been done. Like, it has an exception or

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.120
it's a branch misprediction then this instruction has already deposited it and

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.920
it shouldn't have. So if we deposit in-order, this cannot happen.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.601
We will basically deposit results in order so once we get to deposit.

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.800
That means that all the previous instructions have finished successfully and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000
everything is fine. In Tomasulo's algorithm this is not happening in order.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.050
This is happening out of order which is why we have a problem.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.380
So what we need is a structure called reorder buffer. Even after issue,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.580
it remembers the program order. And it keeps the results of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.410
instructions until they're safe to write to registers. So basically, instead of

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.680
writing to registers whenever the result is produced, it would end up in

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.590
the reorder buffer. And then, we will go in order through the reorder buffer and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.690
deposit results into the registers. And once the result is deposited to

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.200
the register, only then the instruction is considered fully done.
