00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.738
To make sure that you know how to
recognize variables, let's have a quiz.

Let's see if you can identify which things
in these equations are variable terms. So

00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:12.315

term down here that has a variable in it.

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.363
Remember for our purposes right now a
variable is anything that is not just a number.
