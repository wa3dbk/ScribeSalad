There aren't several key concepts that are used in many ways in

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.740
computer architecture. One of those concepts is called pipelining and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.950
it is used in several ways in pretty much every computer nowadays.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.580
You should already know what pipelining is and how it is used in to

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.300
improve processor performance. So this lesson is here mainly to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.230
review pipelining in a way that sets the stage for more advanced topics.
