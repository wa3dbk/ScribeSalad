00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.715
The distance between the mile markers is 20 miles, great work if you found this

00:00:03.715 --> 00:00:08.910
number. We know this is correct, since we want to just count the number of

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.778
miles between 190 and 210. So, we really just want to subtract this mile marker

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:23.036
from this one. So, 210 minus 190 equals 20 miles. And you might have thought to

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:26.890
subtract 210 from 190. That actually would have worked as well. You just

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.216
want to make sure that you take the absolute value of that number. Since 190

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:35.546
minus 210 is negative 20, we want the positive result, or the absolute value of

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:40.378
that number. So either way you think about it, you'll still have a distance of

00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:41.460
20 miles.
