00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.634
Let's look at the answer to our atomic instruction quiz which asks, what do we

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:08.482
need to implement locks easily. An instruction that,

00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:11.446
loads memory, stores to memory, or one that

00:00:11.446 --> 00:00:14.488
reads and writes memory, or one that doesn't

00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:17.980
access memory at all. We already, saw that

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.315
when either instruction does something like this, without

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:25.560
interference from others. So we the instruction that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.900
atomically does this to operations. One is a read, one

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.476
is a write. So an instruction to just read's memory,

00:00:33.476 --> 00:00:35.610
will not give us what we want. It's capable of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.970
doing this, but it's not going to let us do

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.742
this. A store, might be able to do this, but

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:42.999
it can not first check the log variable to see

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.828
if it's available. So what we need really is an

00:00:45.828 --> 00:00:50.610
instruction that both reads, and then writes the memory. And certainly

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.520
we don't need instruction that doesn't access memory because the lock

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.650
var is a memory location. So the correct answer is this.
