00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
As you can see, exactly counting the number of time steps

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.790
even though we have a very simple model of just three rules

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.390
and a code that doesn't even have a variable input is already quite tedious.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.300
We are going to introduce a number of additional simplifications

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.450
that will give us a little more levy here so that we do not have to go

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.770
through this exact counting process but still learns something about the algorithm.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.430
In general, the capabilities of the RAM closely matched what you would expect from

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.100
your own computer but of course it is a simplification

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.790
but nevertheless it is a rather solid model.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.020
It's difficult to design an algorithm that when you analyze it

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.860
it will give you a very different idea about its performance that it would get on the RAM.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.870
Nevertheless, I think it's important to think about the differences

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.080
between a RAM model and a normal computer, and we will do this as a quiz.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.940
Here are four main simplifications that I think the RAM is making.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.739
Here are four properties of the RAM.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.340
The first one is simple operations take only one time step.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.290
The second one is we assume that we have as much memory as we need.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.410
The third one is that memory access is considered to be free in terms of time.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.170
And the fourth one is that a unit of memory cannot hold an arbitrarily large number.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.160
And of course this is going to be subjective, but I would like you to tell me

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.350
which of these four properties you think is realistic in the sense that it comes pretty close

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130
to a real computer and which of these you would consider unrealistic

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.430
meaning of you were to run your algorithm on a real machine

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.010
then there would be considerable differences and again the answers to these are subjective.

00:01:46.010 --> 99:59:59.000
If you get stuck or if you disagree with me just take next and see where our opinions differ.
