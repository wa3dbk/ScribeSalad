00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.190
We get a final answer of 3 times the cube root of 4 all divided by 4. Nice

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.170
thinking, if you found this answer. We know the cube root of 3 to the 3rd is

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.885
just 3, so that comes outside of our radical. We can't take the cube root of 2

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:18.572
squared since this power isn't divisible by this root. 2 squared stays inside

00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:22.567
of our cubed root. For our denominator, we'll use power divided by root to get

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:27.393
2 squared. Now we just simplify our powers to get our final answer.
