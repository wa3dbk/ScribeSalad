00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.150
To help us understand dynamic range,
let's first define the term luminance.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.310
Luminance is basically a measure of
the intensity of light per unit area.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.050
And this is again,
kind of accounting for

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.720
also the light traveling
in a given direction.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.300
So any time it, light is hitting any
surface area, the direction it's coming

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.120
in from, and the luminous intensity
per unit square area of that

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.830
region is what we're looking for, and
that's what the measure of luminance is.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.410
And it's ca, measured in candela per
meter squared, cd over m squared.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.630
To help us quantify this, let's look
at the whole range of luminance.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.442
Now I know we've, in the past, always
looked at a black and white image or

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:52.660
a range of zero to one, or zero to 50,
to 255 in a different set of numbers.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.300
But now, we're going to look at it in
terms of luminance, on a surface, or

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270
an object, or a scene.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.270
And in this case,
let's look at these values.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.420
And again basically,
I'm showing you that this is a log plot,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.710
going from eight, six, four, two, zero,
minus ten, minus four, and minus six.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.940
So, of course, that's why it
kind of has a linear thing.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.090
But these are again,
numbers that are much more in detail,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.020
kind of showing you things about
what's happening in an image.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.500
And I've just now marked in
this range basically in indoor,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.020
sunlight, sunlight is much brighter, and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.880
in fact, there's even something
much even brighter than that.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.810
Indoor images would have
these type of ranges here.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.070
So this point is basically
showing sunlight.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.450
This would be indoor.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.450
These are the kind of images,
we looked at it.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.080
If it, this scene was lit by just
moonlight, directly captured,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.380
that's what we would have.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.950
And, of course, this is starlight.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.960
Now, one thing to note,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.810
the human vision system,
can measure static contrast ratio.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.580
That is, being able to kind of see the
range at any moment, when I'm looking at

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.230
a scene, are from hundred to one,
so ten raised two to one.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.818
And again, the human eye,
in a static case,

00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:12.190
can also adjust itself
by about 6.5 f-stops.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.700
Remember the term of f-stops,
when we looked at from the camera where,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.530
when we actually looked
at what were the f-stops.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.060
And we looked at a variety
of ways of what of happens.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.810
And that basically means is, how wide
the aperture is opening up that allows

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.780
us to capture more light, or less light,
depending on the size of the aperture.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.210
Now, I do categorize this
in two different ways.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.000
One, I'm talking about
static contrast ratio.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.290
Now, another one is
dynamic contrast ratio.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.240
That is meant for
if the scene is dynamically changing.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.970
And in this case, our human vision
system can actually do much better.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.800
And in fact, we see a range from 1
million, ten raised to six, to one.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.240
And basically, this can be captured
with about 20 different f-stops.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.050
So you notice,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.080
the range goes from 6.5 to 20,
when we go from static to dynamic.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.015
Now the big difference that I want to
point out between static contrast and

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.203
the static scene basically is,
nothing is changing.

00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:09.060
With dynamic is when the, the
illumination in the scene is changing.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.510
Now this could be because the scene
is dynamically changing, or

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.850
somebody is changing the lighting
conditions, and this could be again,

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.160
the sun is moving around,
there's shadows and stuff like that.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.240
So that's the difference.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.280
Of course, human eye system,
as we've talked about before,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.140
is a pretty impressive
bit of technology, and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.040
it can adapt quite quickly
to a variety of shades.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.775
And again, something to think about
when you start thinking about the human

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:30.670
saccade system,

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.800
and I encourage you to look at that
kind of stuff on the web, because it

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.180
allows you to kind of adapt very quickly
from one brightness to the other.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.940
Now partly what we are trying to do with
this representation of dynamic range,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.810
is to create images that will allow
us to actually capture dynamic range

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.960
in one static image.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.160
That actually is somewhat similar
to what our human vision can,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.300
system can do.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.700
By moving our eyes around in saccades
and stuff like that, we can see a lot of

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.840
dynamic range, and our eyes adapt very
much to bright and low light situations.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.360
And we can see much more detail.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.690
Of course,
cameras at present cannot do this, and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.930
that's one of the questions for
computational photography is,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.650
how do we kind of, bring in the
computation to make it do the adaptation

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.540
to what it's seeing in the light,
and being able to capture images?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.220
And of course, at the end of it,
we want to create sometimes a,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.360
just a static image that captures it.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.930
You'll see more examples of this
as we continue talking more.
