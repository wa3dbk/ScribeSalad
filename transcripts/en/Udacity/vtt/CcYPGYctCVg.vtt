00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.790
Alright. So, why are statistical significance tests useful? So,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.210
they do provide a formalized framework for comparing and

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.760
evaluating data. And they do enable us to evaluate

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.470
whether perceived effects in our data set reflect differences across

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.149
the whole population. They do not make a bad

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.190
result look good. Significant sets are useful because they provide

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.640
a formalized framework for comparing and evaluating data. Different

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.500
tests have different assumptions and rules that they incorporate, and

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.780
using a particular test ensures that everyone is on the

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.990
same page in so far as what we're assuming about

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.820
our data. Significance tests also enable us to evaluate whether

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.550
perceived effects in our data set reflect differences across the whole

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.796
population. As was the case with our company, where ten

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:45.180
out of ten people polled preferred the color blue. Sometimes an

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.770
affect that we seen in a small sample does not

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.500
reflect what might be true across the entire population. A statistical

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.420
significance test let's us formally determine whether or not this might

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.940
be the case. Unfortunately, a bad result is not going to

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.390
look any better or worse as a result of using a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.950
statistical significance test. If our data's

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.010
bad, or there's really no difference

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.930
between our two samples. We're not going to be able to

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.470
undo that with a test. It is possible though that different tests

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.890
might give us different results. The really important thing and we'll

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.580
go into this a bit more is that you need to use

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.290
the right test in the right situations. Why don't we talk a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.430
little bit about how we might actually run a statistical significance test.
