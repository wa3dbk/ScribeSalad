00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.200
The third myth about microkernel based design is

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.210
that the thread switches and inter process communication

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.960
can be very expensive. And by thread switch

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.060
we mean, if you are executing one thread

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.980
in a particular protection domain and going to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.250
execute another thread in a different protection domain,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.270
how much time does it take for this

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.130
thread switch to be effected by the microkernel,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.590
that's the question that we're asking here. Here

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.600
again, we're only talking about the explicit cost of

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.700
doing the thread switching. And the explicit cost that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.080
is involved in thread switching, is saving all the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.180
volatile state of the processor, the T1 thread

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.110
that is running on the processor. It's modified the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.910
registers of the CPU. All of that has to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.840
be stashed away in the thread context block before

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.440
we can schedule the second thread to run on the processor. The cost that we're

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.060
talking about is saving all the volatile state

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.390
of the processor. And what L3 does is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.940
once again, by construction, it shows that the thread switch time in L3

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.230
microkernel is as competitive as SPIN and exokernel. So,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.590
once again by construction, L3 debunks that myth that microkernel

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.930
based OL structure is going to be more expensive for thread switching

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.930
compared to SPIN or exokernel or even a monolithic operating system.
