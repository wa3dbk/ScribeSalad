00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.111
So, let's assume that the array of grades is completely filled. No partially

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:07.748
filled arrays on this question. Can you write a method which returns the sum of

00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:12.258
the scores for the ith student? If you're ready to try this for yourself, just

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:16.580
skip to the quiz. If you want to see a smaller example first, keep watching.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.844
What if my grade book looked like this, and I wanted to calculate the total for

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:27.020
Sandra. Sandra is at index i equals one. If this whole array was called grades,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.595
then I would want to add up this cell, which would be grades [1] [0], because

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:38.292
this is the first student. And the zeroth topic would be this spot, because

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:44.363
it's student one and topic one. And grades [1] [2] would be this one, Student

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:48.645
One, Topic Two. To get the sum for this student we would want to add all of

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:53.507
these up. Now, it's your turn. Try coding this in BlueJ. But bare in mind, you

00:00:53.507 --> 00:00:58.088
might not know the size of the array up front. There might be a variable for

00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:00.919
the number of topics and the number of students.
