00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.200
In this lesson we're talking about threads and concurrency.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.250
So how am I going to visualize these concepts?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.050
Well, one way you may think of threads is that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.930
each thread is like a worker in a toy shop.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.750
But what qualities make a worker in a toy shop similar to a thread?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.150
The first quality is that a worker in a toy shop is an active entity.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.280
Secondly, a worker in a toy shop works simultaneously with others.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.460
And finally, a worker in a toy shop requires coordination.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.050
Especially when multiple workers are working at the same time.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.510
And perhaps even contributing to the same toy order.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.900
Let's elaborate on these points now.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.635
A worker is an active entity in the sense that

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:48.280
it's executing a unit of work that is necessary for a given toy order.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.420
Many such workers can contribute to the entire effort required for

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.230
an actual toy to be built.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.180
Next the worker can simultaneously work with others,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.660
this is pretty straightforward.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.200
You can imagine a shop floor with many workers, all simultaneously

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.720
are concurrently hammering, sewing, building toys at the same time.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.820
They are working on the same order or others.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.410
And finally, while the workers can work simultaneously,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.580
this comes with some restrictions.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.770
Workers must coordinate their efforts in order to operate efficiently.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.850
For instance, workers may have to share tools,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.341
they may have to share some working areas, their workstations, or even

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:33.230
parts while they're in the process of making toys and executing the toy orders.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.710
Now that we know about workers in a toy shop, what about threads?

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.290
How do they fit into this analogy?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.470
First, threads are also active entities.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.260
Except in this case, threads execute a unit of work on behalf of a process.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.340
Next, threads can also work simultaneously with others, and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.250
this is where the term concurrency really applies.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.240
For instance, in modern systems that have multiple processors,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.360
multiple cores, you can have multiple threads really at

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.449
the exact same time executing concurrently.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.650
But this obviously will require some level of coordination.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.630
And specifically when we talk about coordination, we're really

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.828
mainly talking about coordinating access to the underlying platform resources.

00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:26.210
Sharing of I/O devices, the CPU course, memory, all of these and other systems

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.840
resources must be carefully controlled and scheduled by the operating system.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.080
This begs the question,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.040
how do we determine which thread gets access to these resources?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.760
And as you will see in this lesson,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080
the answer to the question is very important, designed decision for

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.520
both operating systems, as well as software developers in general.
