00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.500
Okay, starting off we've got this work object that's got all of my jobs in it.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.160
Very cool.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.710
Then we come down to the bottom here and we find the locationizer function.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.890
Locationizer's taking in the work_obj from above and

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.780
let's take a look inside of it.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.760
We start off by initializing a new array,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.760
which in this case is called locationArray and it starts off empty.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.130
And then we've got a for-in loop.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.360
This for-in loop is going to iterate over every job within work object dot jobs.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.210
So remember, work object is the object that we have up here,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.080
it's being passed in, and we're going to iterate through all of the jobs in it.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.590
For each of the new jobs, we're going to create a variable and

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.310
don't worry, it's going to get overwritten every time we run through this loop.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.660
The variable is called new location.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.710
And we're going to set it equal to the location of each job.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.690
So let's break this down a little bit.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.340
We've got the work object, and then within the work object,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.130
we've got the jobs array.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.970
And now because of the for in loop,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.940
we've got the index of each job within the jobs array within the work object.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.349
And then for each job we want the location.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.120
So we're just going to use .notation to get the location.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.744
Once we have each location we're going to push them using the .push

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:13.060
array method.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.190
So we'll start off with the name of the array that we want to return later and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.090
we'll do .push with a location as the parameter.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.350
Once this for loop is finished we're going to return the location array which we

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.030
created earlier.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.680
All right, let's go ahead and see if this works.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.730
All right, we'll come down here.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.350
And let's console.log locationizer.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.810
And we'll pass in the work object from above.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.820
And if all goes well, we should see an array of locations where I worked.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.520
We'll hit test run.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.120
Scroll down.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.350
And there we go. The log says that I've worked Mountain View, Seattle.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.700
And I've had two jobs in Nashville.
