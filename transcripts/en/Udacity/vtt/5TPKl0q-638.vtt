00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.388
We have a total degrees of freedom and likewise we have a total variation. This

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:10.430
is also the sum of the sum of squares for between and within group variability.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.910
This is the total sum of squares that we mentioned earlier. Each value, minus

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.354
the grand mean squared and then sum them up. Basically what ANOVA does is

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:24.644
partition the total variation into between group variation and within group

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:29.855
variation. Difference is in the dependent variable or treatment are due to both

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:35.614
between group differences and individual differences within each group. This

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:39.518
means that only some of the variation can be explained by knowing which group

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:43.830
is subject is in and the rest is unexplained variants.
