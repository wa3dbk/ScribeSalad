00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.650
If you know how to create your own analysis, then you're

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.580
ready to choose a dataset. Now, we don't want you to use

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.430
a dataset that comes with our, or in our package, such as

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.350
the diamonds dataset or the empty cars dataset. Instead, you can choose

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.090
one of four datasets that we've collected or you can choose

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.690
to find your own. Now, I want to caution you, finding your

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.420
own dataset can take a lot of time. We only recommend finding

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.670
and cleaning your own dataset if you're comfortable with data munching or

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.860
if you're ready for a serious challenge. In

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.720
the instructor notes you'll find a link to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.970
a checklist for finding your own dataset as

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.200
well as resources for finding publicly available data.
