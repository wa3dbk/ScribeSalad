Hi, welcome to your tour of Udacity. Let's get started. So here's our main

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.022
office area. As you see, it's really open so we can all work together as a

00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:12.788
team. And luckily everybody here is really creative, and that allows us to come

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:17.160
up with awesome ideas and make the creative classes that you guys love. Let's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.393
go to next place, this is the side of the office we come to when we need to get

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:23.732
away from the hustle and bustle of the other side of the office we can relax on

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:27.018
bean bags or on one of the couches and meet up with people and discuss really

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:33.279
big ideas. This is the area where we all come to kind of distress and play

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:36.789
different games like foosball and ping pong and again enjoy working with each

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.083
other, here you can see we have a fully soft kitchen with all the drinks and

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:43.215
all the snacks we could ever want and this is the area were we have lunch

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:50.528
together as a team everyday for some co-worker bonding time. And we can even

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:53.179
bring dogs to the office so we have puppies to play with
