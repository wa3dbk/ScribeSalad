00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.050
To finish Todo we modify 
the NewView method

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.910
to choose layout ID 
based on view type.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.700
If the view type is today,
then we use this resource ID.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.060
This points to the layout XML file 
list item forecast today.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.610
If the list type is for a future day, 
then we use this resource ID.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.046
This points to the list item 
forecast layout XML.

00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:23.506
Then we inflate that layout.
