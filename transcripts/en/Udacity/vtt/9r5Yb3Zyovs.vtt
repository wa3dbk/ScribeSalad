00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.150
And the answer here is that the approximation factor is 2.38, so it's performing worse

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.410
than that take two algorithm, which have an approximation factor of 2.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.760
So what that means is that the greedy algorithm, although the strategy might sound good,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.480
doesn't perform as well as the take 2 algorithm, which is guaranteed to have

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.830
an approximation factor of 2 and that's why it's so important to prove properties of algorithms

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.260
and not just saying--well, this is a sound strategy, this one sounds good,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.360
because while it may sound good, it can actually in some cases perform really bad.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.520
So does this mean that the greedy algorithm is useless and we should always use

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.720
and we should always use the take 2 algorithm.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.250
Well, not really because actually for most instances that you would encounter in a real world setting,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.240
so for example a telecommunications networks as Alice is trying to do--

00:00:51.240 --> 99:59:59.000
this algorithm here will perform very well, but it is not guaranteed to perform very well.
