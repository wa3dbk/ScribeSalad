00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.930
Research on the structure of operating systems in the mid' 90s, as exemplified

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.160
by the three research papers we studied in this course module, led to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.100
fascinating innovations in the operating system

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.850
structure. It is important to note that

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.050
all three systems, Spen, exokernel, and the

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.410
LT microkernel were done contemporaneously. In this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.340
sense, they mutually informed each other

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.840
and laid the basis for several innovations

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.860
in operating system structuring. For example,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.800
many modern operating systems have internally adopted

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.710
a microkernel based design. Similarly, technologies

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.220
such as dynamic loading of device drivers

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.520
into the kernel, have come out of the thoughts that went into extensibility

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.720
of operating system services. The next lesson we're going to look at is a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.130
logical progression of the idea of extensibility, namely virtualization.
