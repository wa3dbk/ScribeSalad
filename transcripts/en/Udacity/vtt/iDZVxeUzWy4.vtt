00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.480
We can also use frames to address the Raven's Matrices problems that we

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.490
have been talking about all throughout this course. In fact as we do so

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.170
we'll note another interesting fact, frames in semantic networks are closely

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.620
related. So let's do this problem. Here is a particular image and

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.140
here is a semantic network for this particular image that we had come across

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.260
earlier. I could rewrite this semantic network in the language of frames. But,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.380
first of all building a frame for each of these specific objects.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.090
I have frame for x, a frame for y and a frame for z. So, here are the frames for

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.880
the three objects, x, y and z. Let's look at the frame for z in more detail for

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.390
just a second. So, here are the slots, the name is z,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.000
the shape is a circle the size is small and it is filled, you can see it here.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.380
We can also capture the relationship between these two objects. So

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.360
let's consider a relationship example. Here y is inside x, y is inside x.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.270
We can capture that through this slot for the object y. Here is the slot for

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.190
inside, for the object y, and it is pointing to x, indicating that y is

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.120
inside x. Note again the equivalence between the semantic network and

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.420
the frame representations. The three objects and the three

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.250
frames corresponding to three objects. The relationship between the objects and

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.610
the relationships being captured by these blue lines here between the frames.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.690
While we can capture relationships between frames through lines like this where

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.730
one frame points to another frame, we could also capture them more directly by

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.770
actually specifying variables of other frame names. So for example, for

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.630
the frame y, we might say, inside x which captures the same idea that we

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.400
were capturing by drawing a line between them. In fact,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.870
this is a notation we'll use with the rest of the exercises in this lesson.
