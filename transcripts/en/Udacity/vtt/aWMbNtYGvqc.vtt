We just talked about variables written in the form like this, f of u comma v.

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:08.973
So, we have two independent variables and one dependent variable. An example of

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:13.830
a situation like this in real life is finding the area of a rectangle. Note that

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.366
the rectangle area is going to depend both on the length of the rectangle and

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:23.446
the width of the rectangle. So, if we choose to call the length, l, and we

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:29.180
choose to call the width, w, and we choose to name the function A, how can we

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.144
express the area of a rectangle as a function of length and width? Please write

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:36.769
this in form f of u comma v.
