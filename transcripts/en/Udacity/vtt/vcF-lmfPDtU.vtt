00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.213
At the beginning of this lesson we talked about car sharing and what classes

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:10.326
one might be able to use to implement a car sharing simulation. And we hit upon

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:13.945
the classes car and person. Let's go ahead and actually implement those

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:17.984
classes. So, we'll imagine a bunch of people that all gather at the departure

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:24.828
location. There's a long road, with destinations, that we'll just label 1, 2,

00:00:24.828 --> 00:00:30.490
3, and so on. Each of the people wants to go to at one of these destinations.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.670
Maybe this one wants to go to three, same with the others. And then, we'll have

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.234
cars, that also have destinations. Let's say this car wants to go to

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:43.069
destination 4, then of course, this car can pick up whatever passengers want to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:48.410
go destination 1, 2, 3, or 4. But not one that wants to go further. And, of

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.242
course, the car can only load as many passengers as they have seats. Make that

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:58.217
one less because the driver also needs a seat. So, now we need to figure out

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:02.683
what are the responsibilities of the classes. Let's start with the person

00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:07.662
class. A person should know their destination. In our stimulation we also

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:12.095
want to give names to people so, of course the person should know that too. A

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:15.551
car should be able to pick up a passenger provided, of course, and only the car

00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:20.879
will know that whether there is room and whether the destination is on the way.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:24.065
And, of course, there is another thing that a car should be able to do, it

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:28.635
should be able to drive. It looks like the person is the easy of the two, let's

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:33.062
look at that first. Here's the Person class. You can see we have two

00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:37.409
properties, a person has a name and a destination property with a getter for

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.956
each of them. These are read-only properties. Once a person has been

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:48.110
constructed with a particular name and a particular destination, that doesn't

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.282
change. Remember, it's just a simulation, these are not real people but, just

00:01:53.282 --> 00:02:00.468
objects for use in our simulation program. Here is the Car class. Most

00:02:00.468 --> 00:02:06.695
importantly, a car collects passengers. A car also knows how many seats it has.

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:11.850
The name of the driver, we'll just use that for reporting. The current

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.934
location, it starts at zero and goes up by one every time that the car drives

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:23.340
to the next location. And that is destination. We construct a car with a driver

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.945
name, number of seats and the destination. Initially it has no passengers and

00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:34.742
is at location 0. So, now it's your turn. I'd like you to implement the

00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:38.882
tryToAdd method. Where we add a person to the car, at least we try because if

00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:42.662
there's no room or the passenger wants to go further than the car wants to go,

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:48.789
then it's not going to work. In that case, you shouldn't add p to the passenger

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:53.177
array list, but you should return false. On the other hand if you can't

00:02:53.177 --> 00:02:59.295
accommodate the person. Go ahead and add it and return true.
