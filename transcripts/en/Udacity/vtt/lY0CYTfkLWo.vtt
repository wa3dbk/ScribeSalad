00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.540
Now, we should be pretty happy, we've got the guts of our program working. We've

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.932
tested it, we've got some confidence this is going to work correctly. But we've

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:10.899
got a problem, we're not getting the right answers. And we're not getting the

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:14.666
right answers, because not all months have 30 days. We've tried to put off this

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.914
grungy detail of dealing with the reality of the real world and most

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:21.742
computational problems in the real world eventually run into issues like this

00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:25.420
that aren't that interesting, but are very complex. So now, we've gotta deal

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.748
with the complexity of how many days there actually are in a month, that's the

00:00:28.748 --> 00:00:32.195
only thing we have left to deal with. One of the good ways about solving the

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.672
problem this way is we got close to an answer without dealing with all that

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:39.377
complexity, but we've gotta deal with it at some point, and now is the time that

00:00:39.377 --> 00:00:40.526
we have to deal with it.
