00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.506
To craft delightful details like these,

00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:07.260
we'll take a look at the VectorDrawable
and AnimatedVectorDrawable classes.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.410
We'll start by looking at what
VectorDrawable allows us to do,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.825
to understand what we can animate.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.400
VectorDrawable was introduced in
Lollipop and let's you create density

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.290
independent images by defining
a series of drawing commands.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.410
It's similar in concept
to SVG on the web.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.510
Here's an example of a VectorDrawable.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.530
It defines a path which has a series
of space separated drawing commands,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.860
which use a subset of the SVG path data
spec to draw lines, curves and so on.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.380
For example, these commands draw
a cross by moving to a point.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.680
Drawing a line to another point.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.660
Lifting and moving to another point.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.030
And drawing another line.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.090
Simple.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.910
Now vectors aren't appropriate for
every kind of image.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.910
You wouldn't want to represent
a person's face with a vector,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.980
for example.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.190
But iconography and simple
illustrations are great candidates.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.380
The vector format provides
density independence,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.170
meaning that the same image
works on any screen density.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.430
When vector support reaches enough
devices, you won't have to explore

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.400
assets at multiple different sizes
like we covered in Lesson One.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.410
It also generally produces
a small file size.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.640
But the opportunity to animate all or

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.030
parts of the image is what we're
really interested in right now.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.495
The AnimatedVectorDrawable class let's
you animate any property of a part of

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:26.340
set of parts.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390
Here's a list of what you can animate.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.910
Now, the first five have pretty
standard animation properties.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.670
But having the ability to target
individual elements within the drawable

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.711
is quite powerful.

00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:42.360
Let's take a closer look at these
last three more unique properties and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.830
the kind of animation they allow.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.480
We can animate the actual path data
itself, allowing you to morph, so

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.880
to speak, one shape into another.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.880
Here's a simple example of
changing a tick into a cross.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.170
We can, of course,
combine this with other effects,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.070
such as throwing in a rotate,
to get a little bit fancier.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.610
The restriction when morphing is that
the shapes need to have the same number

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.680
of drawing commands in them in order
to interpolate between the two states.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.140
When drawing a path, VectorDrawable
allows you to only draw a portion of it

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.240
by trimming the start or end of it.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.200
In this example, we had a path, which is
the handwritten word, Android design.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.585
And animating the trim on it
produces this fun writing effect.

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:30.640
VectorDrawables also support
the notion of clip pass.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.240
That is applying a clip
region to your drawing.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.900
Animating this clip region allows you to
reveal or hide portions of the image.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.120
So in this example we
have an outline heart.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.620
And then on top of that a filled heart.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.810
By applying a clip region to
the filled heart on top and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.950
animating it, we can produce this
filling up and emptying effect.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.860
These were just a few examples of what
you can do with animated vectors.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.540
They're a great opportunity
to make your app feel alive.
