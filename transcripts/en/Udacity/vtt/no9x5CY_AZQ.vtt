00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.100
I'm sure you're raring to get to work on

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.880
the conference central application. You've already downloaded the code from

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.109
GitHub. Let's take a look at the layout of the

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.570
folders in the downloaded code. So here's where I downloaded

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.730
the code. You see there's a folder for each

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.000
lesson, lesson two, lesson three, and so on. Inside each

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.680
folder, you see folders containing the code to import into

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.820
Eclipse. You already imported this one, the Hello endpoints project.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.570
And then next, you're going to be importing the first

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.630
of the central Conference Central projects, which is this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.549
one here. Some folders like Lesson four include partial

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:39.350
code. These folders contain classes or fragments of code that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.310
you'll be adding to your project in that lesson.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.270
For the Conference Central application, we provide starting code

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.590
for each lesson. You can start working on it

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.150
with a starting code in the Lesson two folder and

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.290
keep working on it throughout the course. At any point if you need, you

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.930
can import the starting project for that lesson. You might want to do that for

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.760
example, if you didn't finish all the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.138
coding exercises in the previous lesson. So now,

00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:06.303
it's time to import the Conference Central

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:08.769
project from the lesson two folder into Eclipse.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:18.769
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:23.449
And down here in the advanced section if you want,

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:26.640
you can enter a name for your project. Every Maven

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.720
project has an artifact which is used as its name,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.664
but you didn't create the artifact for this project, so

00:01:32.664 --> 00:01:35.230
feel free to add your own name if you want.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.108
So see up here, I have my Conference Central project

00:01:39.108 --> 00:01:42.809
and the Java code is inside the SLC folder, inside

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:46.904
Con &gt; Google &gt; Deverel &gt; Training &gt; Conference. And

00:01:46.904 --> 00:01:49.172
you'll see the different packages in the

00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:51.960
conference package. So go ahead and import the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.550
project into Eclipse, and then answer a couple

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.980
of questions. The two files you're going to be

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.531
working with in this lesson are profile.java and

00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:03.260
conferenceapi.java. When you've figured out what packages they're

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.186
in, come enter the values here. Where is

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.979
profile.java, and which package is conferenceapi.java are in?
