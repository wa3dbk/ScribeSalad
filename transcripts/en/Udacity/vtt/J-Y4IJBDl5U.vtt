00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.630
So now we will look at one of the so
called LRU approximation algorithms,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.160
which this one is called NMRU or
Not Most Recently Used.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.330
And it's trying to approximate
the performance of LRU but

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.340
with less activity on his.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.380
So again, NMRU stands for
Not Most Recently Used.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.890
The way it would work is that we would
track which one block in the set

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.360
is the most recently used one,
at any given time.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.640
And then,
when we need to replace something,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.540
we pick a block that is not the block
that is the most recently used.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.870
So, for example, we can pick
randomly among, the other blocks,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.320
but we save the most recently used
block from eviction from the cache.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.100
So how do we track which block is MRU?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.910
Let's say we have an N-way
set-associative cache and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.470
we want to track the MRU block for
each set.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.940
We need only one MRU pointer per set.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.880
We only need to know
which block has been

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.820
the most recently
accessed one in the set.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.910
So for example, if we have a two
way set-associative cache,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.649
we only need one bit to tell us which of
the two is the most recently accessed.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.340
If we have a four way set associative
cache we will have a two bit pointer

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.030
that tells us which of the four has been
the most recently accessed and so on.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.121
Compare this to N LRU counters that
we need percent\g in a four way

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:33.870
associative cache, we would need
a two bit pointer for NMRU.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.110
We would need four two bit
LRU counters to maintain LRU.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.464
So this policy keeps N
times less state for

00:01:43.464 --> 00:01:48.140
an N way set associative cache,
then the true LRU policy.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.120
It turns out that this policy
works reasonably well.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.090
It does have a hit rate that is
slightly lower than a true LRU,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.710
but if this is what it
takes to make our cache

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.510
go from two cycles hit time to one
cycle hit time, It might be worth it.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.710
A disadvantage of this policy is that

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.130
although it prevents the most recently
accessed line from being evicted,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.640
it doesn't know what the order
is among the rest of them.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.280
So there is a truly least recently
used block among these three for

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.300
example, but we don't know which one.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.060
So we will pick one of these three and

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.900
might select something that is
not the least recently used.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.940
So although this works well because the
most frequently accessed thing well be

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.430
saved in the cache, it is slightly
weaker than through LRU because of this.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.800
Because it doesn't know which
one is the really recently used.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.320
So what we might want to have is
a policy that is still simpler than LRU

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.440
but keeps more track about what's
less recently used than the MRU
