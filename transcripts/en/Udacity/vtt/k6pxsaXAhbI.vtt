00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.920
Okay, I mentioned earlier that
getting everything up-to-date would

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.320
require merging the local and
remote branches.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.870
How does this work in practice?

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.166
As it turns out,
when you have a remote set-up,

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.690
Git stores local copies of
all the remote branches.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.770
These will each contain the state of the
remote branch as of the last time you

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.230
pushed or pulled the branch.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.275
Let's look at how this would play out
over the lifetime of a repository.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:23.100
We'll consider a repository that got
created on GitHub with a readme, and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.100
then got cloned.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.330
Remember that cloning sets up
a remote for you called origin.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.210
We've already seen that when you clone
a repository, you get a local branch

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.520
called master, that points to
the same commit as the remote one.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.620
But what you haven't seen yet
is that you also get a local copy of

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.500
the last known position of
that branch on the remote.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.310
The name of that branch includes
the name of the remote, origin,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.100
since you can have
multiple remotes set up,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.910
as well as the name of
the branch on the remote.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.810
In this case, master,
which is to be separated by a slash.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.650
So in this case, it'll be origin/master.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.840
And since we've just had
an interaction with the remote,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.240
it's currently in the same location
as the actual remote version.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.530
Let's consider what happens when you

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950
make commit on the master
branch locally.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.500
As usual,
when you make a commit on a branch,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.830
that branch will get updated
to point to the new commit.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.710
But, neither the local
origin/master branch, nor

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.300
the actual master branch
on the GitHub repository,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.270
will get updated because you haven't
communicated that you want to do that.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.960
However, if you push the master branch,
the local origin/master branch and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.330
the remote GitHub branch will
get updated with the new commit.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.590
Similarly, if this branch were
to get updated on GitHub and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.230
then we pulled, both of these would
get updated with the new commit.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.560
Let's go back to thinking about what
happens if you've got different

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.400
changes on each repository, with one
change locally and another remote.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.220
It turns out that you can update just
the local copy of the remote branch,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.310
leaving your actual local version alone
by running the command git fetch.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.340
In cases like this, where there
are potentially conflicting changes,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.830
using git fetch to update the local
copy of the remote branch can be nice,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.590
so that you can use git log and git diff
to see what changes were introduced,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.430
both on the local and
remote repositories.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.000
This way,
if you're going to be offline for

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.050
a while,
say if you're about to get on a plane,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.670
you can update your local copy of
the remote branch before you leave.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.250
And then you'll have access to any
updates that have been made to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.240
the remote since you last synced up,
while you were offline.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.008
But you don't have to act on
combining those commits right away.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:12.630
Speaking of combining changes,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.470
now that you have the commit from GitHub
on your local repository, it's now

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.680
possible to incorporate them into
your master branch, using git merge.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.880
It turns out that this is exactly
what happens when you do a git pull.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.300
First, the remote branch gets fetched,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.790
updating the local copy
of the remote branch.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.230
Then, that branch gets
merged into the local one.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.530
To put it more concretely, in this case,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.210
fetching updates origin/master with the
contents of GitHub's master branch, and

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.250
then origin/master is
merged into master.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.990
So git pull is the same as git
fetch followed by git merge.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.590
Now Caroline will demonstrate doing this
process on the recipes repository on

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.240
the command line.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.310
&gt;&gt; I can update the local copies by
running git fetch origin, which will

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.420
update all of the local copies of
every branch for the origin remote.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.400
I can inspect the local copies by
running git log origin/master.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.300
Or git diff origin/master master.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.800
But before I do that,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.820
I want you to predict what you'll
see if you run these commands.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.620
You can also run the commands
yourself to see if you're right, but

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.220
it can help to think about
this before trying it.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.540
I'd like you to predict
the output of git log and

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.310
git status both before and
after you run git fetch.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.960
If you run git log origin/master
before you run git fetch,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.380
which of these commits do
you think will be shown?

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.670
Larry's commit, adding the chili recipe?

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.800
Your commit, adding a new spice?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.130
Sarah's commit, removing cumin?

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.300
Check all that apply.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.480
Similarly, check all the commits
you think will be shown after you

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.040
run git fetch.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.640
When you run git status
on the master branch,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.180
Git will let you know whether your local
master contains any commits that are not

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.410
reachable from origin/master or
vice versa.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.960
If you run git status
before you run git fetch,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.500
will it say that your local master is
one commit ahead of origin/master?

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.200
One commit behind origin/master?

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.210
Will it say that your
branch is up-to-date,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.920
meaning the two branches
point to the same commit?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.120
Or will it say the two
branches are out of sync,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.070
meaning each has a commit
not present in the other?

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.230
Similarly, after you run git fetch,
what will git status say?
