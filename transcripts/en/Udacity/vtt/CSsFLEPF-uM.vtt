00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.240
To find the updated total future earnings,
we're going to start by writing down the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.756
initial total future earnings we had. So,
this is our baseline, this is what we

00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:13.277
start out with, and now, I'm going to show
how these two changes affect the equation.

00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:17.832
The first thing that happens is that Mr.
Belvedere triples the amount of money that

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:22.092
Grant will eventually make off of these
first orders. So, that means we need to

00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:26.832
multiply this quantity, 84w+60n, by 3.
So I'm going to have to put parentheses

00:00:26.844 --> 00:00:31.186
around it and write a 3 out front.
Great. Then the 2nd step is that a

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:36.410
school orders, one set of wipers and one
pair of nozzles for each of its 150

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.858
students. So that means that for one
student, the school wants one wiper set

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.468
and two nozzles since they're a pair of
nozzles. And we know that one wiper set

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.715
costs w dollars, so for one student, the
school is going to pay w plus the cost for

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:55.463
the two nozzles, which we know is 2n. So
the school pays w+2n for every student.

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:59.665
However, they have 150 students to pay
for, so that means that the amount the

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:07.100
school will pay is 150(w+2n), so this is
our final equation. The updated total

00:01:07.112 --> 00:01:11.955
future earnings will be equal to 3
times the quantity 84w+60n, and then,

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:18.768
added onto that, 150(w+2n) to account for
the orders from the school. So looking

00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:22.716
back at the quiz that you took, I'm sorry,
I left out the word total from the quiz,

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:26.717
these are the same quantity. So we need to
figure out which of these four choices

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.746
corresponds with or is equal to this
expression up here and the correct answer

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:35.274
is this 4th choice. Now this doesn't
look exactly like this equation, number

00:01:35.274 --> 00:01:39.990
for number, and that's because the 150 has
been distributed to the two terms inside

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:44.472
the parentheses. So, if we do that, we
keep the first part of the expression the

00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:49.032
same and then I just multiply 150 by
either the terms in the parentheses, just

00:01:49.044 --> 00:01:52.192
like you did with all of your practice
using the distributive property. 150 times w is

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:58.314
just 150w and 150 times 2n is 300n. So that's
why the final answer is the correct

00:01:58.314 --> 00:02:02.369
choice. Great. Now, we're one step closer
to giving Grant a very nice and easy to

00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:06.109
use equation for the amount of money he's
going to earn.
