00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.918
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And this system of equations is interesting, because we have two parallel

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:08.232
lines. It turns out these lines will never intersect. We can see that the lines

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:12.606
are parallel. And we also know that from their equation. The slope of each line

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:16.852
is 10. That means we pay 10 more dollars for each hour we rent the car. The same

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:21.202
is true for a car from Mini-Hoopties. We pay 10 more dollars for taking the car

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:25.747
out for an hour, ten more dollars for another hour. If we look at the equations,

00:00:25.747 --> 00:00:30.025
we can see the slopes are the same and the y intercepts are different. Any two

00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:34.117
equations with these properties will be parallel lines and they'll never

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.491
intersect. So there won't be a solution.
