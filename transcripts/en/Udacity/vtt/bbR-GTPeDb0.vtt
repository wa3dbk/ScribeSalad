00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.293
So for this problem imagine you’re a criminal,

00:00:03.293 --> 00:00:06.552
specifically a bank robber. And from the bank

00:00:06.552 --> 00:00:11.533
you stole three things, a statue, a mask, and

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.868
an erne. And I should probably got pictures to

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:17.409
help you visualize this scenario. So now I’ve

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.869
added pictures. Believe me you have no idea

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.958
how long it took indiscernible and to make

00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.119
any scenario more realistic we’re going to add

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.674
of course monetary and physical attributes to

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:31.408
each of these items. And you want to steal

00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:38.087
weighs 15 kilograms and costs $30,000 and

00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:42.788
the scary mask weighs 9 kilograms and is worth

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:48.155
$16,000 and lastly we have the erne. The erne

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:53.994
weighs 8 kilograms and costs $15,000. So now

00:00:53.994 --> 00:00:56.875
I present to you a question. You didn’t go

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.772
to the Jim enough and you can only carry

00:00:59.772 --> 00:01:03.736
20 kilograms. So how would you solve this?

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:07.088
One thing you might do, if you’re in a hurry and

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:09.495
you’re about to be chased down by the police

00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:14.046
is take the one that weighs the least and try to

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.924
get as many things as possible, hoping that you

00:01:16.924 --> 00:01:18.646
will make enough money from indiscernible

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:23.210
Another opportunity might be to take the one that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.210
is worth the most, kind of ignoring what it weighs

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.598
. Another choice would be to calculate the ratio

00:01:30.598 --> 00:01:34.049
between the weight and how much its worth.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.759
That way you chose items as long as you can carry

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.084
them based on the cost per kilogram basically, the

00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:44.364
amount of money you’re making per weight.

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:46.816
It turns out all three of those solution just

00:01:46.816 --> 00:01:49.285
don’t work for this problem. The last one

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:52.150
will work, if you can take say half an erne

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.361
, but for this you don’t really want to take

00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:57.646
half the erne. It’s worth nothing, unless it’s

00:01:57.646 --> 00:01:59.444
sold together and same for the mask and statue

00:01:59.444 --> 00:02:01.592
. So, you want to choose specifically which

00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:04.388
items to take. So taking the statue along

00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:07.084
doesn’t work. And it turns out the correct

00:02:07.084 --> 00:02:10.160
answer is to take the mask and the erne.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.209
So this is a surprisingly common problem in

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.696
computer science and I suppose if you’re in

00:02:15.696 --> 00:02:17.880
a life of crime, it comes up often too. In

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.325
computer science and economics this comes up

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:22.909
when dealing with kind of resource obligation

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.225
and making choices about which items to chose

00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:28.125
based on how much a cost function and how

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.648
much they’re worth to you. So this is tricky to

00:02:30.648 --> 00:02:33.081
do quickly. And so when I’m going to ask you

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:34.685
to do it, I mean, you can numerate all the

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:38.016
possibilities, but that doesn’t really scale

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.977
once you get to say, I don’t know, 15, 20

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:44.099
items. So we’re going to ask you to do is to

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.281
write two functions that will help us to check

00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:48.820
whether given solution is correct.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.069
The first answer we’re going to write is called

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.002
heist valid. And this is going to return true or

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:57.686
false on whether or not the items you’re stealing

00:02:57.686 --> 00:03:00.139
is a valid thing to take away. We’re going to

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.611
ask if everything you’re trying to steal is less

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:05.775
than the total weight that you can carry and

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:08.529
never going to think about heist total, which

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.698
given a list of things you’re going to steal

00:03:11.698 --> 00:03:15.287
returns how much all those items are worth

00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:18.037
. So heist valid for the mask and the erne,

00:03:18.037 --> 00:03:21.001
that’s the correct answer. Nine plus eight

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.004
is less than 20, so we’re going to return true

00:03:23.004 --> 00:03:26.404
. And the heist total we’re going to add 16 or 15

00:03:26.404 --> 00:03:29.952
in return to that total, pretty straightforward.

00:03:29.952 --> 00:03:32.251
But we’re going to make it a little bit more

00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:34.818
tricky since we know how skilled you’re

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:39.483
and require you to get off a one line solution

00:03:39.483 --> 00:03:42.376
. Hence this doesn’t really come off, up often

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:45.016
when you’re in the real world programming

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.683
, but we’re enforcing it here so that we

00:03:47.683 --> 00:03:49.646
encourage you to use these comprehensions

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:51.799
and kind of think out of out of type the box

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.064
. So what are inputs? We’re going to take in

00:03:55.064 --> 00:03:58.243
three things. A dictionary that essentially

00:03:58.243 --> 00:04:00.028
catalogues all the things that we’re able to

00:04:00.028 --> 00:04:03.786
steal. Each key in a dictionary is the name

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:07.177
of the item that we can steal. And the value

00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:12.326
is a tuple where the first entry in the tuple

00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:15.060
is the weight of the item in kilograms and

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.926
the second entry is the monetary value of

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:20.713
the tuple in dollars. Although the units here

00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:23.077
don’t really matter as far as we’re consistent

00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:26.171
. We also have a limit to what we can carry

00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:29.146
. And lastly we have a list of strings

00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:33.086
corresponding to the heist here of what we’ve taken.

00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:36.528
So let’s do the first function. Since its

00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:38.838
we have to return something,

00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:41.308
its probably going to start with a return keyword

00:04:41.308 --> 00:04:43.278
. So what we’re going to do in this one line is

00:04:43.278 --> 00:04:46.006
add up the weight for each item that we’ve

00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:49.058
taken and see if its less than the limit. And

00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:51.428
because python is so awesome, this is pretty

00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:55.180
easy. So we’re going to take the sum of a

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.439
list comprehension that generates a list of the

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.861
weight of each item that we’ve taken. This is

00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:03.587
going to be the name of the item and that’s how

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:06.451
we’re going to get the tuple out of the dictionary

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:08.923
and we just care about the first item and

00:05:08.923 --> 00:05:10.772
that dictionary in for takings.

00:05:10.772 --> 00:05:12.988
So we’re going to go through each string and the

00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:17.612
taken list, look up the value in the dictionary

00:05:17.612 --> 00:05:21.338
corresponding to that item and take the first

00:05:21.338 --> 00:05:23.443
element in the tuple, which is the weight and

00:05:23.443 --> 00:05:25.013
we’re going to return that in our list. So when

00:05:25.013 --> 00:05:27.410
take the sum of that and we’re simply going

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.897
to check, if it’s less than or equal to the

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:34.523
limit. That’s a one line solution. Hurray!

00:05:34.523 --> 00:05:37.290
The next problem is going to have a very similar

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.359
answer. In this case, we’re going to go through

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:45.842
each item and take in get the tuple out of the

00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:49.342
available dictionary for that item and simply

00:05:49.342 --> 00:05:53.762
sum up the cost. Here is the key difference.

00:05:53.762 --> 00:05:57.890
So this list comprehension returns a list of all

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.141
key values of each item and we’re going to

00:06:01.141 --> 00:06:03.638
take the sum of return. Those are

00:06:03.638 --> 00:06:07.638
one line solutions to each of those functions.
