00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.110
So here is your mini project. We want you to

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.580
create your very own secret message, for a friend, or a

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.150
loved one. Now, the secret message could be anything from

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.430
you wishing them a great day to you telling them how

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.070
happy you are to have them in your life. You

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.870
can start by showing them the jumbled up version of your

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.070
message. Now, we have provided some images of the alphabet

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.010
in the instructor notes. You can use them if you'd like.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.730
Then run the program and reveal your secret message

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.290
to your friend. Your assignment is to share videos or

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.550
photos of your friend's reaction with us on the discussion

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.830
forum. Once you're done, check this box before you continue.
