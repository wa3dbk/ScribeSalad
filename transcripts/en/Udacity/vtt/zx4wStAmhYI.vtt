00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.270
Let's use last.fm's API as an example, and let's

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.970
see how we can interact with it to get

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.450
data and find out the top albums in the US, China, and Spain. As you can see on

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.510
the left hand side here, there are a few

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.480
different last.fm API methods that we can talk to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.280
and retrieve information from. For example, let's check out

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.180
the album.getInfo method. As you can see this page

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.120
tells us the type of data that the API

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.610
method will return like artist name, album name and

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.260
a bunch of other information such as language or

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.600
a music brains ID from the album. But the question

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.770
is now how do we actually get to this

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.130
data from last fm's API. It's actually really simple. We

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.890
can simply copy and paste a link like this

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.280
into the web browser. And look at all the information

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.850
that last.fm returned to us. Okay, now I

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.380
want to point out a few interesting things about the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.800
URL. See all the parts after the question

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.550
mark? That's how we define API parameters. Like the

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.050
method. The API key, the artist name and

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.540
the name of the album that you want data

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.240
for. So for example, if we wanted information

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.730
on a different Rihanna album, like the album Unapologetic,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.500
we could simply change the album parameter

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.670
here from Loud to Unapologetic. Let's see if

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.260
that works. Look, we now have the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.470
data from Rihanna's album, Unapologetic. Pretty simple, huh?
