When we factor a quadratic trinomial, we want to find factors of a times c that

00:00:05.343 --> 00:00:11.644
sum to b. So in this case, we want to find factors of 1 times 6, or just 6, that

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:16.582
sum to 5. I know 3 and 2 are factors of 6, that add to 5. So I can use those to

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:21.834
rewrite my middle term. Then we use factoring by grouping to get x plus 2 times

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:26.017
x plus 3. Great work if you got that one right. You might have noticed a pattern

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:30.456
when factoring trinomials that have an a value of 1. The two factors here always

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:36.286
appear in this parentheses. But keep in mind, this is only if the a value is 1.
