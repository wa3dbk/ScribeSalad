00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.279
Let's now calculate the effect size measure Cohen's d. Just like before with

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.468
the one sample t test. Cohen's d is the mean difference divided by the standard

00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:13.162
deviation for the differences. Remember that the mean differences was negative

00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:17.631
2.72. And the standard deviation was 3.69. Calculate Cohen's d? Just like

00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:19.740
before with the one sample t test.
