00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.810
The definition of pipe and filter from Wikipedia is a chain of

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.850
processing elements called filters arranged so that the output of

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.970
each element is communicated by a pipe to become the input to the next.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.100
Layered architectures according to MSDN,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.440
the Microsoft Developers Network, is the grouping of functionality into

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.080
distinct layers that are stacked vertically on top of each other.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.300
Communication between layers is explicit and loosely coupled.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.180
Blackboard architecture, out of the artificial intelligence world,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.870
according to Wikipedia, is a common knowledge base.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.530
Is iter, is iteratively updated by a diverse group of specialist knowledge

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.089
sources, starting with a problem specification and ending with a solution.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.420
The object oriented architectural style according to MSDN is the division of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.610
responsibilities into individual reusable and self-sufficient objects each

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.260
containing the data and the behavior relevant to the object.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.010
Note that object oriented architectural style is somewhat different than what we

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.900
talk about an object oriented program or object oriented process for

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.876
developing programmers.

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:13.650
Finally, implicit invocation, according to Garland and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.920
Shaw, is a component can broadcast events.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.160
Other components in the system can register interest in those events,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.170
by associating a procedure that should be called when the event is detected.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.110
When the invent is announced by the system, the system itself invokes all of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230
the procedures that have been registered for the event.
