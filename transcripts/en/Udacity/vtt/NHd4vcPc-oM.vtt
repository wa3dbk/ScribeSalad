To conclude, patterns are an essential part of developers' vocabularies.

00:00:04.415 --> 00:00:07.850
We simply must be aware of what's there in order to take advantage of it.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.320
However, patterns are difficult to learn passively.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.050
You can read all the catalogs you want. But

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.730
unless you actually get some experience with catalogs, they're not going to be,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.100
come to mind readily when you're in a development situation. However,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.420
despite these costs and potential problems that might arise from using patterns,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.340
they are so powerful that you want to take advantage of them when you can.
