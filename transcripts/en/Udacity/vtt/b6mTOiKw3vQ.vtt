00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's say there are two types of people for simplicity—type A and type B.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Type A are the popular ones.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
They have 80 friends.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And type B are less popular. They only have 20 friends.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You might now say that I don't know which type you are.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I will compute what's called the expected or average number of friends.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
To do so, I assume that half of the people are of type A

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and half of the people are of type B.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here's your very first quiz in this class.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Into this box enter what you think is the expected or average number of friends

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
if you have a 50% chance of being a type A and a 50% chance of being a type B.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Type in here when you're done.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
There is a submit button somewhere down here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You can see if your answer is correct.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Regardless of whether you finish this or not,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
at some point just hit the next button,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and you'll see my answer.
