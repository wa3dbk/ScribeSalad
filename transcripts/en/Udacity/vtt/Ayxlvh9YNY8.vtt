00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.040
&gt;&gt; So from the top state we have three possible next states.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.640
We can move both of them, we can move just the prisoner, or

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.780
we can move just the guard. From this one we can either move one prisoner or

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.790
two prisoners, and from this one all we can really do is move the prisoner back

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.970
over to the left. Remember that David is not generating these successive states.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.460
David is saying that the DOM generator will generate the successive states.
