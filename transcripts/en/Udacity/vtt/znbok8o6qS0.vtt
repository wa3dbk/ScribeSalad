00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.298
The MAO inhibitors andtTricyclics were introduced in the late 1950's and early

00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:10.662
1960's. They both increase levels of norepinephrine and serotonin. The MAO

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:15.150
inhibitors work by increasing the availability of serotonin, norepinephrine,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.237
and dopamine. However, the use of MAOs is limited due to the side effects and

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:25.488
toxicity. That is, users must avoid certain foods and drugs to prevent serious

00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:30.440
side effects. One such side effect is a life threatening increase in blood

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.455
pressure. The tricyclics were discovered when researchers were working to

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:40.070
create a better phenylthiazine antipsychotic and found a drug that improved

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.011
mood. Although not effective for all patients, they do reduce the severity and

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:50.578
duration of the depressive episodes. The tricyclics include the drug

00:00:50.578 --> 00:00:55.130
imipramine, and that drug was discovered accidentally. Some of the tricyclics

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.540
are also used in the management of chronic pain, for bed wetting, and for the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.950
treatment of ADHD, as we saw in the discussion on drugs in our consciousness

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.570
lesson, drugs can produce side effects and the side effects for the tricyclics

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:17.940
include dry mouth, irritability, weight gain, confusion and constipation.
