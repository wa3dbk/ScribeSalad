00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.730
I want to repeat that I can't teach you design, you have to learn it. And

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.520
I want you to learn it using the projects that have been defined for

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.190
the course. I encourage you to invest energy in those projects and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.140
to think systematically about the design issues that each one of them raises.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.440
Express that systematic thinking in the form of some experiments that you run,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.660
then write up those experiments in the form of a report. I think by doing this,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.600
it will force you to reflect upon the design process, and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.680
thereby, make it much more real to you.
