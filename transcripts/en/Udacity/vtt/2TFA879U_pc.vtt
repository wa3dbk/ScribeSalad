What if I were to ask this question instead?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Make the function query return a list of links

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
submitted by user 62443,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and sort those links by the submission time ascending.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The earliest submission first,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the last submission last.
