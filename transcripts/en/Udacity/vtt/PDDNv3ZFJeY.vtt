Transparency is the main point of failure. The other methods changed the

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:06.761
illumination on a single surface. The final value is then mapped in some

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:10.780
fashion to a color. With transparency, you're first mapping the opaque material

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.080
to a color then you're blending this color with whatever transparent filter is

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.800
covering a pixel, then mapping that result to some new color. It's mixing

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.460
results from shaded pixels with solid colors which is unlikely to work well.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.640
We'll see in a later lesson that image processing is often a better way to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.085
perform cel shading, as this maps from some final shaded color to a solid value

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:32.289
just once.
