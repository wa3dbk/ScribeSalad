00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.755
In addition to RSA and

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:05.780
Diffie-Hellman which are the most
widely used algorithms.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.280
There are other public key algorithms.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.550
First, the National Institute
of Standards and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.610
Technology on list, has published
the digital signature standard

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.160
It is based on the secure
hash function SHA1.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.400
Note that this algorithm is only for
signature.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.950
Is not for encryption or key exchange.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.990
RSA is the most widely used public
key cartography algorithm for

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.810
encryption and digital signatures.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.420
Recently a competing system called
elliptic curve cryptography

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.450
has begun to challenge RSA.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.640
The main advantage of ECC over RSA

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.540
is that if offers the same security
with a far smaller bit size.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.920
That is, for the same security strength,
it can be much more efficient than RSA.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.020
On the other hand,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.350
RSA has been subject to a lot of
cryptanalysis work over the years.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.860
whereas for ECC, the cryptanalysis
work is still at a beginning,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.780
therefore we are not as confident
in the ECC as we are in RSA.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.230
ECC is more difficult explained

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.500
in the form that medical description
is beyond the scope of this course.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.090
But briefly, the technique is based on
the use of a mathematical construct

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.360
known as the elliptic curve.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.940
Roughly speaking, two points, p and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.360
t on the elliptic curve are known or
made public.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.640
And p and t have the following
relations, t times p equal t,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.440
under the so called point multiplication
and the fact that d is the private key.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.140
Mathematically, even p and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.910
t, which are public, it is very
hard to find t, which is private.
