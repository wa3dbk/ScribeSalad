00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.720
Interoperability remains a major
technical issue because of

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.000
the multiplicity of EMRs
in use here in the US.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.837
There are hundreds of certified EMRs and
although a dozen or so

00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:19.990
represent 75% of all installations,
the rest are spread among many vendors.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.340
As you can see from this graphic
from the ONC's dashboard,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.400
a place I recommend you visit.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.610
These systems were not designed to
record data in a standard fashion or

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.485
to share data with other systems.

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:35.675
They are not interoperable.

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:40.885
EHR certification creates a very
minimal degree of interoperability.

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:41.825
As we'll see later on,

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:46.395
building technologies to facilitate
more extensive data sharing among

00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:50.195
these systems is a major focus
of contemporary health IT.
