00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
This course has, mainly, 3 goals.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.340
After having taken this course, you will be able to recognize

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.800
what makes a problem challenging for a computer to solve.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.000
You will also have an understanding of why these problems are challenging.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.250
And through that understanding, I will show you a number of techniques

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.730
that you can use to navigate around computational complexity.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.750
So this course will not only enable you to recognize and understand tough problems

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.910
but also give you many tools and techniques that you can use

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.369
to actually solve them in practice.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.340
And this is something that, in my experience, is not taught very often.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.940
So some people will be able to recognize that a problem is challenging;

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.650
fewer people will understand what makes these problems challenging.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.440
But when it comes down to knowing the techniques that you can use

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
to solve these challenging problems, despite their computational complexity,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.710
then my experience is that knowing these techniques can really make you stand out.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.350
During this course we will come across many algorithms

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.460
especially when we study complexity theory, but this is not a course about algorithms in general.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.360
Rather, they will be a means to an end, to understand what makes problems hard,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.430
and, of course, also to navigate around computational complexity.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.910
So for taking this course you should have a basic understanding of algorithms,

00:01:13.910 --> 99:59:59.000
although we'll also cover the basics to make sure that you all start out on the same level.
