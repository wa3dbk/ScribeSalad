00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.719
For the next step, let's do an exercise that focuses

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.400
on extracting out the value of one of those attributes. We're

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.480
going to do this exercise a little bit differently. You'll implement this

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.740
on the Udacity platform. And we'll be able to verify that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.420
your code is correct. After this video, you'll see an IDE

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.870
like this. Where it contains some starter code, as well as

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.790
some j unit tests in a separate tab. In particular, we

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.780
want you to implement this function, to get the max temperature

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.160
for a day. You're given a weather JSON

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.390
string, formatted the same way as you would get

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.700
from the Open Weather Map service. And you

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.910
also get the day index that we care about.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.340
Feel free to play around with the code

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.520
in Android Studio, or a separate development environment, before

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.070
you paste your answer here. Or you can use

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.800
the Udacity IDE. Whichever feels more natural to you.
