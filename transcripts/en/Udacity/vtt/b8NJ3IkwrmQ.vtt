00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:05.199
If you plug in x equals zero, the result has to be five.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.132
Look at this term. If x equals zero, we have e to the power of zero, which is one.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.566
To turn that into five, this has to be five.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:22.866
In the other box, we need to minus three. This is easy to see if you know about the chain rule.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:28.732
The inner derivative provides us with a factor of minus three, which we need.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:32.766
If you don't know the chain rule, you can argue as follows:

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:38.066
We start with e to the power of X. The standard exponential function.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:47.466
Next, let's form e to the power of minus x, which means to flip that blue curve along the y axis.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:58.966
To compute E to the minus X for a specific value of X, we can compute E to the X for minus that value of X.

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:03.232
So we're mirroring the blue curve to get the green curve.

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:12.766
This additional factor of three accelerates the green curve. E to the power of minus 3x is three times as fast,

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:20.999
if you will, as E to the power of minus X. To compute E to the power of minus 3x for this X,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.632
we can compute E to the power of minus X for three times that X.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:32.966
And now look at the derivatives. By going from the blue curve--the regular exponential function--

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:38.366
--to the green curve, we are changing the sign of the derivative.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:44.166
Here the derivative is positive. Now it's negative all of the time.

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:51.032
And with that additional factor of three in the exponent, you're boosting the derivative by a factor of three.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:59.632
Look at these triangles. The horizontal leg of this slope triangle is reduce by a factor of three,

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:04.333
meaning that the slope increases by a factor of three.
