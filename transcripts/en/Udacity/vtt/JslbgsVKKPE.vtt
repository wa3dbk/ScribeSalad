00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.990
Well start with the house class.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.750
To begin with, the house class will
have three properties an address,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.750
represented as an MLS.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.660
sting.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.730
A bowl, indicating whether
the House has a hot tub or not.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.660
And an int,
representing the number of bedrooms.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.450
In the diagram here, I've depicted
objects, outlined in orange.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.620
&gt;&gt; To write our house class first we're
going to create a command line project.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.800
We'll be making a lot of these
throughout the course so

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.810
do take the time to click
through these steps on your own.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.980
Under file click New, and
then Project instead of an iOS

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.500
app this time choose OS X application
and then command line tool.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.640
And we'll call this house, and

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.495
make sure Objective C is
the language that's chosen.

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:47.240
With a command line tool, we can
focus on the code and not worry so

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.700
much about the UI.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.490
To add the files for
the house class to the project,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.490
control click on the house folder just
like you would any other Xcode project.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.260
Go down to a new file.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.510
Choose OS10 as your source and
then coco class.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.360
And again, we'll call the class house.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.748
Now, in the project navigator on the
left you should see the files house.age

00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:11.430
and house.m.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.720
In Objective C every class is associated
with two files, a header file and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.460
an implementation file.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.910
The header file represents the public
interface and the implementation file

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.550
holds method implementations as well as
any properties we'd like to be private.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.560
Open up the house.h file and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.460
you'll see that the house class
descends from the class in this object.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.830
All objective C classes
descend from this class.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.810
The class has been declared for
us using at @interface

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.120
the name of the class colon and
then the name of the superclass.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.560
Let's go ahead and
declare our properties.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.870
For now, we'll do that in the header
file which means they'll be public and

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.060
accessible outside the class.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.870
To do that I type at sign property
nonatomic then the class that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.650
the property belongs to which
in this case is an NSString, and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.690
asterisk to indicate
that this is a pointer.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.430
And then,
the name of the property address and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.669
of course top it all
off with a semi-colon.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.620
We'll add number of bedrooms,
and since a number of bedrooms is

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.320
a primitive type, an int,
we don't use a pointer.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.000
And the same goes for
the BOOL, hasHotTub.
