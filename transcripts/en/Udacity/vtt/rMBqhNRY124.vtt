00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.520
The answer is that only this
first statement is true, and

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.860
it shows that the empty
problem is undecidable.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.650
The reduction is straightforward.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.470
The output machine just runs the input
machine on the empty string.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.270
And if it halts, it accepts.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.350
If the input machine is in H bar that
means that it loops on the empty string.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.310
And so will the output machine,
and it will accept nothing.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.000
On the other hand, if the input machine
is not an HTM, that means it does halt.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.840
And then the output machine
will accept everything.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
Use pencil and paper to confirm that
this reduction works for yourself.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.152
If you try to use a similar argument for
these next reductions, you'll find that

00:00:45.152 --> 00:00:49.039
the machines output by the reduction,
except when you want them to loop or

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.066
reject, and loop or
reject when you want them to accept.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:55.715
But, proof by Lack of imagination
isn't very satisfactory.

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:59.355
So let's actually show that if
these statements were true,

00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:01.135
then we would get a contradiction.

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:02.565
If we could find these reductions,

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:06.975
then this one would directly imply that
the halting problem is decidable, and

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:11.380
this last one would imply that
the empty problem is decidable.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.100
Let's erase the rest and
focus on this contradiction here.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.970
We'll let R be the reduction such
that the description of the machine M

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.240
is in H if and
only if R of them is in E.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.490
Then we let A be a recognizer for
the compliment of E.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.130
The compliment of E is the set of
machines that except something.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.680
We talked about how we can
recognize this language

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.640
with the dove tailing strategy before,
so assume that A implements that.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.810
So to decide H we run M on empty
string and A on R of M in parallel.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.300
If M halts on the empty string,
we recognize that fact.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.260
And if it does not, we'll then R
of M must be an E complement so

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.510
A must recognize that.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.270
And running these in parallel allows
us then to decide the halting problem.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.980
One way or another,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.880
we're going to ge tan answer
from one of these two machines.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.490
Overall then,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.540
the moral of the story is that you can't
mapping reduce a recognizable language,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.230
like the halting problem to a
co-recognizable like the empty problem.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.010
A co-recognizable language, by the way,
is one whose complement is recognizable.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.980
And vice versa doesn't work either.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.580
Keep this in mind when you're
trying to prove undecidability.
