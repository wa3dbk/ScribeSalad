00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.466
This would be the numerator and this would be the denominator, fantastic algebra

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:08.406
skills if you figure those two out. Now, I know you might have never seen this

00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:12.990
being distributed to a fraction. let's see how we can do that. We'll distribute

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.482
the 8x to each term in the numerator and to each term in the denominator. This

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:22.682
pare is the easiest of the multiplications we'll have 6 times 8x, which is 48x,

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:27.280
for the second one the x's will cancel. We will have an x in the numerator and

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.384
an x in the denominator. So we'll be left with 3 times 8 which equals 24. If

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:37.328
that seems a little off to you, think of 8x as 8x divided by 1. You know x

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:42.816
divided by x equals 1. So we're left with 3 times 8 which equals 24. For this

00:00:42.816 --> 00:00:48.796
multiplication 8 divided by 4 equals 2. So we're left with x times 2 x, which

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:55.130
equals 2 x squared. And finally, for the last one, 1 8th of 8x would just be 1

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.174
x. 8 divided by 8 equals 1, so we're left with 1 x.
