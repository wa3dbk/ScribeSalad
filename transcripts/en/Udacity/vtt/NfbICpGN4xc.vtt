00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.430
All right, now we know what image gradients are.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.210
In this lecture, what we're going to do is,

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.970
we're going to build on the concept and start computing edges.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.420
Now, edges are one information theoretic way of looking at

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.680
very minimal information within an image.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.930
What we will actually propose is, using this will help us get

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.750
towards feature detection, which we will actually study later.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.840
But, in this lecture, what we're going to do is now learn more about how we can,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.295
in reliable ways, extract information from images, like edges, based on

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:34.340
image-creating computations that we learned how to do in the previous lecture.
