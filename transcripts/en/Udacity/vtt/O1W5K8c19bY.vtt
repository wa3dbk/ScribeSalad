00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
So far, our units have focused on showing that problems are hard

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.010
or NP complete to be more precise.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.110
Actually, what I have very often observed in practice,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.190
and even in scientific papers where the office did not have a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.020
solid background in theoretical computer sciences is this.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.880
Once a problem is shown to be NP complete,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.290
many people would  just tend to give up or come up with some,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.600
well honestly terrible algorithm that they've justified with.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.660
Well, the problem was NP complete,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.760
and that is why we're now going to turn our attention

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.250
to count the measures against NP completeness.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.260
So, this unit and the following units are your first aid kit to help you overcome NP completeness

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.090
or at least take a bit of the sting out of it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.720
because imagine you find yourself in the situation like the four computer scientist

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.690
that we have gotten to know throughout this course like Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.970
Solving tough problems was part of their job.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.470
Alice was solving vertex cover for telecommunications;

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.210
Bob was working in biotech developing new medicines, analyzing genes;

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.690
Carol was working in finance designing secure investments;

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.050
and Dave was working in logistics where he had to solve the shortest tool problem

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.810
and actually there are logistics companies who developed algorithms

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.880
with which they save millions everyday and also fuel.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.180
So, those problems are practically relevant although they are NP complete.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.340
So, when your company or your boss asked you to solve an NP complete problem,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.850
what should you do--should you say, "I want another problem,"

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.120
should you make her or him take this course so that they finally understand NP completeness,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.570
should you say "It's impossible to do that,"

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.460
should you say "It's proven impossible,"

00:01:42.460 --> 99:59:59.000
or should you say "It's proven difficult but we can try."
