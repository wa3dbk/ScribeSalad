00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.042
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The first step here is to recognize that what we're looking for is the value

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.548
of x-coordinates where y equals 0 along this curve. So we need to set y equal to

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:12.774
0. Once we're here, we can come up with two separate equations that will help us

00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:16.924
find values for x that will make this true. So we can either have 2x plus 1

00:00:16.924 --> 00:00:21.517
equals 0, or we can have 3x minus 2 equals 0. If either one of these equals 0,

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:26.148
then this entire side of the equation will equal 0, and we'll be good to go. Now

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:30.747
we just need to solve for x. Solving for x gives us a value of x equals negative

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:35.341
1/2 for this equation and x equals 2/3 for this equation. If we plug either of

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:39.957
these in, we will make this equation true. But remember, I asked you for points.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:44.670
And in particular, I asked you for what the x-intercepts of this equation are.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.428
We can just read them off now, using these as our x-coordinates and remembering

00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:54.291
that our y-coordinate has to be 0 for an x-intercept. Voila. Two lovely points.
