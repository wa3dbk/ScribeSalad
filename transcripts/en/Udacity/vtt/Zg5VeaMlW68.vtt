00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.400
that your users are going to have a

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.630
good network connection. Or any network connection. It's

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.750
important for your web app to still work even

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.470

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.820
how you can treat the network as a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.490
potential enhancement to your application, rather then a requirement.
