00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:04.046
This coordinate would be negative 40, 30.

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:06.749
Nice thinking if you got these two numbers.

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:10.313
Even though the distance is reported as 
a positive value

00:00:10.313 --> 00:00:15.624
we need a negative x coordinate in order to indicate 
a different direction.

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:17.825
If we just had 40, 30

00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:20.431
then the end of the string would be the same position

00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:22.789
that we described first over here.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.935
We moved in the negative x direction

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:27.314
so we use negative 40 for the x coordinate

00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:30.566
and then positive 30 for the y coordinate.
