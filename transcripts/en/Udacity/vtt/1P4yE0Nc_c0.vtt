The problem with this documentation comment, is that the first sentence should

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.060
describe what the method does. This one just tells us that a person can have

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.030
friends. That says something about what a person is, but not about the get

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.610
friends method. We might instead of written something like returns a summary of

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.121
a person's friends, at return the names of friends, separated by spaces.
