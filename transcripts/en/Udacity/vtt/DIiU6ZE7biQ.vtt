00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.400
Up through now we've been focused on
the traditional one patient at a time

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.080
care paradigm.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.630
While this is, and should always be, the
primary focus of healthcare, it should

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.570
be clear to you that especially with
patients who have chronic disease, or

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.290
in managing public health
problems across the population,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.490
a different approach is needed.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.260
Here, informatics has a key and
essential role to play in aggregating

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.840
and reporting data in ways not
anticipated in the traditional EHR.
