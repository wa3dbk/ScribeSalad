00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.421
Right now, Grant's booth area at the Expo is 10 feet wide by 15 feet long. That

00:00:05.421 --> 00:00:10.708
gives him a total area of 150 feet squared. Since area is just length times

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:16.268
width, which is 10 times 15. Now this whole slingshot game is taking up a ton of

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:21.351
space. In fact, he's already way outside his boundaries in terms of where the

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:25.982
ball is ending up. He's also worried that if people throw really poorly, they're

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:30.365
going to hit people in other booths. That would definitely not be good marketing

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:34.612
for Grant's Gleaming Glasses. The person in charge of the Expo told Grant that

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:38.712
he can, in fact, expand the space that he is in under one condition. He has to

00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:43.332
increase his dimensions by the same amount In both directions, if he's going to

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:48.091
make this any bigger. For now, I'm going to call that link that we're going to

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:52.834
add on, x. Grant, ambitious as always, wants to double the area of his booth.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:57.539
That way he'll have 300 square feet of space to do whatever he wants with. The

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.221
question is, how much does he need increase these dimensions by? What does x

00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:04.325
need to equal to make this happen?
