00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.198
Now, once we have the ability to manipulate the canvas, the next step is

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:07.239
figuring out how to do the right way. So, you'll find that as the number of

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:10.633
images in your environment and the number of images in your asset set start

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:14.174
increasing exponentially, the management of that and drawing to the screen, is

00:00:14.174 --> 00:00:17.300
actually going to get exponentially harder as well. So, in this unit, we're

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.082
actually going to introduce the concept of an atlas, and talk to you about how

00:00:21.082 --> 00:00:24.986
to boil all of this complexity down into something that's usable, and easy to

00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:25.311
do.
