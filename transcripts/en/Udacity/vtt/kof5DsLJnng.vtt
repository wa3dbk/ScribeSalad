00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.836
You've just implemented the choice question

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.308
[UNKNOWN],

00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:08.032
and used it in a program that displayed two choice questions. Previously, you

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:12.770
had written a program that presents two plain questions. Can we mix the two?

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.242
How can we write a program that presents a plain question, and then a choice

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:21.512
question? Should we provide two present question methods? One for questions,

00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:24.473
one for choice questions, or is it okay to provide a single present question

00:00:24.473 --> 00:00:27.387
method who's parameter has type question, and use that to present both the

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:32.674
question and the choice question? Or should the parameter of that single method

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:37.860
have type choice question? Or, are we trying the impossible? What do you think?
