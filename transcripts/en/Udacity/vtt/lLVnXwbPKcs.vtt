00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.150
So, what happens on the next step,
all right?

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.210
Well, the first thing that
happens is we resample.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.380
By the way, we're going to go
through the exact algorithm of this

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.700
in a little bit.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.360
To resample what we do is we
first randomly pick a particle

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.530
from this top distribution.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.650
This is the distribution we had
after the multiplication, right?

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.430
And of course the, the bigger
the weight the more likely we'll pull

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.830
out a particle,
that's what these weights mean.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.020
So we're more likely to find things
here than say over here for two reasons.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.724
One, there's just more particles over
here, than over here, or to the right,

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:38.100
than on the left.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.280
And also those particles
have a higher weight.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.750
They have a bigger value.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.650
So I sample the particles, and

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.170
every new particle that it creates
starts off with a uniform weight.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.830
So I just, let's say I need
1000 particles, 1000 times,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.890
I, I might get the same particle
more than once, that's okay.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.870
Then what I do is I,
I sample and I move.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.040
Now, what do you mean, move?

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.570
Well, remember those actions,
the use, okay?

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.490
So if I, if the robot thinks it took
a step two meters to the right, okay?

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.300
It shifts that particle by two meters.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.710
It shifts its belief of
where it is two meters.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.550
And then finally,
it adds a little bit of noise.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.080
This is just like we were doing
with the common, remember?

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.800
You start off with a distribution.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.180
You do the deterministic shift,
and then you add some noise.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.300
Well our, to do our distribution, we
first have to sample our particles, then

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.620
do the deterministic shift, then we,
add a little bit of uncertainty to that.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.326
Okay, so here you can see the resulting
thing is we have a density that has been

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:39.240
resampled, so
there's like a whole bunch of points.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.280
And shifted with a little
uncertainty added in.
