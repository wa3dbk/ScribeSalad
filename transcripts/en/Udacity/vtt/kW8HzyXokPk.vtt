00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.875
One way that it's helpful to approach word problems is to start off by thinking

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:08.957
about what information we already have. In this problem, we know that the

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:12.434
number of ants is equal to 3 times 10 to the 3rd, and the length of one of

00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:17.656
those ants is 2 times 10 to the negative 4 meters. Once we know what

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:21.156
information we have to work with, we can think about what we want to find. In

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:25.427
this case, that's the length of the entire line of ants. All these ants lined

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:29.630
up in one line. To get from this information to this information, we need to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.970
multiple these two numbers together. So, we need to calculate 2 times 10 to the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.087
negative 4th, times 3 times 10 to the 3rd. Now the way we would normally write

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:49.001
those numbers, would be 0.0002 and 3,000. So two 10,000ths times 3,000 is equal

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:56.104
to 0.6. So now we can conclude, that the whole line of ants is 0.6 meters long.
