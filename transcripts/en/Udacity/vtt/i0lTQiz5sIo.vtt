00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.510
There are many different types of machine learning

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.240
problems, but two common ones are supervised learning and

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.020
unsupervised learning. Machine learning typically involves generating some

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.220
type of model regarding the problem we're trying to

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.440
solve. We'll feed data into this model and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.620
then try to make predictions. In supervised learning, there

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.080
are labeled inputs that we train our model

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.010
on. Training our model simply means teaching the model

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
what the answer looks like. So, for example, if we

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.100
were detecting spam using supervised learning, we might have 100 emails

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.960
where we know whether or not they're spam. We can

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.054
use these emails, where we know whether or not the email

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:42.000
is spam, and train a model that can predict whether

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.350
or not a future email will be spam based on a

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.340
bunch of characteristics, maybe its contents, or whether or not it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.450
has an attachment, or things like that. Another example of supervised

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.350
learning would be estimating the cost of a new house,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.500
given that we have a number of examples where we know

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.060
about a bunch of features like the square footage, or the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.140
number of rooms, or the location. And we also know how

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.410
much that house sold for. We could train a model,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.900
and then predict how much a future house will sell for,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.790
given we know all the same parameters. This is an example

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.700
of regression. When performing unsupervised learning, we don't have any such

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.860
training examples. Instead we have a bunch of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.430
unlabeled data points, and we're trying to understand the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.090
structure of the data, often by clustering similar data

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.810
points together. For example, if we were to feed

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.570
an unsupervised learning algorithm a bunch of photos,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.710
it might split the photos into groups, say photos

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.210
of people, photos of horses, photos of buildings, without

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.160
being told a priori what those groups should be.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.590
It might not know that the groups are people, or horses,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.245
or buildings, but it can tell that these distinct groups exist.
