00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.513
So this is a little bit trickier.

00:00:01.513 --> 00:00:04.292
To answer this one we have to look at the code after the procedure,

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:06.951
and remember we said the procedure is replacing these four lines.

00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:10.778
After the procedure what we do is print the value of "url."

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:15.243
So that means we definitely need at least "url" as our output

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:17.429
and all of the choices here included "url."

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.666
But that's not all we do, so we have to look at the second line as well.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:25.485
This uses both "page" and "end_quote."

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:30.980
The value of "page" here is the same value of "page" before the procedure

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.592
So we don't actually need to return the value of "page."

00:00:34.592 --> 00:00:36.714
It doesn't need to be an output from the procedure.

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:38.132
We already know that.

00:00:38.132 --> 00:00:39.644
We knew that before we called the procedure.

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:41.596
The procedure doesn't change the value of "page."

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:44.367
No sense making it an output.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:48.878
So this answer doesn't make sense. We don't need "page."

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:52.216
It does make sense to make "end_quote" one of the outputs.

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:54.393
The reason we want "end_quote" as an output is

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.566
we need to know where the end of the quote was

00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:01.215
to advance the page, so the next time we look for the next target,

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.682
we don't find the same one that we just found.

00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:06.760
So we actually need this, so this is the best answer to the question,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.665
is that we need two outputs, we need both the url, and the value of "end_quote."

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.898
The fourth possibility could work.

00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:18.246
If we return both the url and the value of "start_link,"

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:24.392
We could figure out a way to advance the page to not find the same quote,

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:27.009
but we'd basically have to redo all this code.

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.501
We need to look for the next quote, starting from "start_link."

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:32.347
We need to look for the closing quote for that.

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:34.709
Basically we'd need to compute the value of "end_quote" again.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.694
So it's a lot more useful to return the value of "end_quote,"

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:40.801
than to return the value of "start_link."

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.000
That's why the third choice is the best choice.
