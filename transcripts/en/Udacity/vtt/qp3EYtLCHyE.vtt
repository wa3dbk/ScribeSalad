The reflection of x equals 4 in the line y equals x is just y equals 4. We can

see on the graph that the line y equals x cuts this picture exactly in half.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.936
This part of x equals 4 gets mapped over to this part of y equals 4, as does

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:17.609
this part to this part.
