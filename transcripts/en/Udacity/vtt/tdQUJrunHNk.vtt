00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.660
Now this you've seen before.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.170
I'm just going to show this again.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.170
This is how we can actually make
all of this wonderful stuff happen.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.160
Here, basically you see
the multiple images,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.480
they've been all warped together, based
on the kind of stuff we've talked about.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.970
Again, if you notice, in this camera,
they were all taken from the same

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.590
projection point rotating
the camera this way.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.240
And now we have all of these images.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.040
Each one of them has been warped.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.086
And registered on top of each other.

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:28.080
Here we basically kind of,
see them on top of each other,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.306
but as I move them around, you can see
that they're all perfectly aligned.

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:35.638
This is the this is
the software I used to do this.

00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:37.430
There are many different
types of softwares of course,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.100
you can use this, use your cells for
a variety of things.
