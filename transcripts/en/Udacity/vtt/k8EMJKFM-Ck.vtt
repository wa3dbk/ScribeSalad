00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.710
I just said that using
a combination of push and set value

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.939
is the best option for adding new
shopping lists to the Firebase database.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.330
But let me show you why
instead of just telling you.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.700
Right here is where we have
our list of shopping lists.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.320
This is all the data for one list and
here's all the data for another list.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.770
And for the sake of space,
I'm not drawing out the whole tree for

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.530
every single shopping list.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.760
Using the three other
methods besides push,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.660
we need to choose what to use as
the key for each of these objects.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.750
A reasonable approach might be to
choose the name of the list as the key.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.390
Consider a scenario where we've
written the code for user accounts.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.180
And in this scenario,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.170
we'll say that both my roommates Walter
and Kagure have their own user accounts.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.545
And we'll say Walter has one list,
which is named grocery list and

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:48.880
Kagure has one list which is named party
supplies, and they're represented here.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.025
Let's decide that at some
point while using the app,

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:55.620
Kagure decides that she wants to make
a list called grocery list for herself.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.400
It's completely separate from Walter's
grocery list that he's made for himself.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.860
At this point, if we're using keys for

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.190
names, we'd run into the issue of having
two lists that have the exact same name,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.120
and therefore the exact
same URL location.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.810
So what would happen?

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.860
Well, if there aren't any permissions
that are protecting lists from being

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.690
overwritten, Kagure's list could
simply overwrite Walter's.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.590
Walter would probably not be
super thrilled to find that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.260
his list has been randomly overwritten.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.220
If we had permissions that kept users
from overwriting other user's data,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.970
then Kagure would be in this
position where she's being

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.020
denied to write a list
called Grocery List.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.810
So maybe if Kagure was feeling
particularly like she really

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.920
wanted a list called Grocery List, she'd
make something like Grocery List 1.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.550
And the next person could make something
like Grocery List 2, and Grocery List 3,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.000
and so on.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.895
This isn't the best user experience,
and this is kind of silly.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:51.868
Just because one person has
a shopping list named grocery list,

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:55.169
that doesn't mean that nobody else
using the app should also have a list

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:56.920
called grocery list.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.640
Another option is to not
use list names as keys and

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.000
instead to try to find something
else that is certain to be unique.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.460
Enter Push.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.940
Push generates a unique ID for
you to store a list under and

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.240
it ensures uniqueness.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.035
Here's some examples of
what push keys look like.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.811
They're sort of bizarre collections
of numbers and letters.

00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:22.465
Via Firebase magic, this ordinary string
has the extraordinary attribute of being

00:02:22.465 --> 00:02:23.653
completely unique.

00:02:23.653 --> 00:02:28.137
So when Kagure wants to add her grocery
list, push will generate a unique

00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:32.933
key for her, thus allowing for both
Walter and Kagure to have grocery lists.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:36.760
Okay so hopefully right now you agree
that using Push is a good choice.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.520
Now Push only generates this key,
so you also need to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.280
use set value to actually generate and
store this value here.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.670
What I want you to do is
update this button so

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.430
that it adds a new shopping list
to the Firebase database and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.750
if I keep adding lists I should
see my data growing here.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.970
Now you could watch me do it, but you're
a developer, so why not try it yourself?

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.490
I'll send you a spec.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.070
And actually,
in addition to implementing Push,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.950
could you also add
a timestamp created property?

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.320
It should store when
the list was created.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.460
It's always good to keep
track of these things.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.300
Before you get started, you probably
want to go ahead and flush the database.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.050
You're making a big enough change
right now that having old data

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.280
could create errors or confuse you.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.944
To quote, unquote, flush the database
you can go to the Dashboard and

00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:21.575
delete it.

00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:23.955
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:27.610
It's scarily simple,
just click this little red x.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.260
Obviously, in a production app and a lot
of times when you're in development,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.080
this could be really disastrous.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.975
So if you're worried that you might want
to revert back to the dataset that you

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:39.140
had before,
you could always export your data here.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.830
It spits it out as JSON and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.840
then if you ever need the data
back you can import it here.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.705
But this is sort of throwaway data.

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.061
&gt;&gt; What?

00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:52.461
Where did my shopping list go?

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:54.841
Lila?

00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:57.720
&gt;&gt; Got to go but
I'll send over the spec right away.
