00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.340
Let's compare the difference between a token bucket

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.050
and a leaky bucket. The token bucket permits traffic

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.260
to be bursty, but it bounds it by the rate row. On the other hand, a leaky

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.420
bucket simply forces the bursty traffic to be

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.815
smoothed. The bound in a token bucket is as

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:22.070
follows. If our bucket size is beta, then we

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.720
know that in any interval T, then the rate

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.860
is always less than beta, that is, the

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.300
maximum number of tokens that can be accumulated

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.710
in the bucket, plus the rate at which

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.220
tokens accumulate, times that time interval. We also know

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.880
that the long term rate will always be

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.040
less than rho. Token buckets have no discard

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.370
or priority policies, whereas leaky buckets typically implement

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.490
priority policies for flows that exceed the smoothing rate.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.590
Both are relatively easy to implement, but the token

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.550
bucket is a little bit more flexible since it

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.750
has some additional parameters that we can use to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.570
configure burst size. One of the limitations of token

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.310
buckets is the fact that in any traffic interval

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.910
of length T, the flow can send beta plus

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.200
T times rho tokens of data. If a network

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.660
tries to police the flows by simply measuring their traffic

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.430
over intervals of length T, the flow can cheat by sending this amount of data in

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.980
each interval. Consider, for example, an interval of

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.430
twice this length. Well if the flow can send

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.880
beta plus T times rho in each interval, then over 2T the flow can consume 2

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.410
times beta plus tau times rho tokens. But

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.680
actually this is greater than how much the flow

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.730
is actually supposed to be able to send which is beta plus 2T times rho. So

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.990
policing traffic being sent by token buckets is

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.270
actually rather difficult. So, token buckets allow for long

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.780
bursts, and if the bursts are of high

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.490
priority traffic, they are difficult to police and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.570
may interfere with other high priority traffic. So

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.690
there's some need to limit how long a token

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.000
bucket sender can monopolize the network.
