00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.370
I want to actually get you to understand a little bit more about gradients, and

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.410
I'm going to use this example.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.340
Remember, again,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.260
gradient magnitude is this and the angle comes from this equation here.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.870
This was simply the derivative, in x.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.460
This is the image for this one.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.850
This is the derivative in y.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.990
This is the magnitude, the whole value of this thing.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.430
Of course, the brightness and stuff like that is kind of compromised because we

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.140
scaling it up from between 0 and 255, but this basically now starts showing you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.800
exactly where the gradient magnitude is for this image.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.380
If you notice the zebra all of the changes anywhere are now visible here.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.010
This image is the gradient angle theta.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.660
So at any point it basically says, where is the direction of the gradient.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.870
Now this is extremely hard to visualize and understand very carefully, so

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.970
what we'll actually do is come up with another way of looking at it.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.140
One way of looking at this is basically being able to now look at

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.240
all the gradients, and drawing a arrow in the direction of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.770
where the gradient increases, and also giving that vector.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.290
Because if you remember, in essence, this is the magnitude of the vector and

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.050
this is the direction where the great intensity is, and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.310
the direction of the gradient.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.540
I've shown this with the zebra image here.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810
Of course it's hard to see, so let's zoom in.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.860
Zooming in now starts showing you the gradient vectors and developmental detail.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.720
Even zooming in more you can now see what I was referring to.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.760
Now note again, this is something that was important, that the magnitude and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.310
the direction of the gradient is this way.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.700
However, the edge that we want is this way.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.540
Direction this way, edge this way.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.070
Similarly, there is another edge here.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.280
And the direction for this one is also this way.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.300
So that's an important thing for us to look at.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.120
And use that to be able to kind of model these things.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.910
Of course, here we're looking for just the absolute directions and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.370
stuff like that.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.930
Even more close up you can see the edge and the red directions and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.390
the magnitudes of the gradient.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.200
Let me show you this thing in a different way.
