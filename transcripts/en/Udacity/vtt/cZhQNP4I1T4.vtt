00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:06.220
So this exercise that we've gone through with the clock radio, really is a,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.160
an example of a process which you could use to do say chart modeling. And

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.770
here are the step that we went through. We prepared a use cases to start with of

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.590
typical uses of the clock radio. We determined the external percepts, that is,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.490
what the user can see or hear or feel, with respect to the device.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.120
We modeled those percepts with states, which may be corresponding to

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.630
currently executing state machines. We determined the external controls and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.490
the stimuli or actions or user actions that could occur. In doing so,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.100
we might model with additional states and, or add in additional transitions or

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.960
events. Then we began to consider the responses that the system have and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.780
we did this with a table in which we listed. The various events and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.520
the responses of the systems to those events. We added in some external

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.110
internal states or state machines to handle the timing situation.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.040
We provided coordination mechanisms including the guarded transitions and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.628
new internal events. And added any additional actions and

00:01:17.628 --> 00:01:23.354
activities that the clock radio is required to do in order to implement, or,

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:27.285
or implement these particular responses, and

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:30.890
then we, we validated the resultant a state chart
