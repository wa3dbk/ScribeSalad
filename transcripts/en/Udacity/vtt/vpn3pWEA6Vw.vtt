00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.700
This is what I put in.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.680
I needed a max-width media query that
would set the background-color to

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.520
red when the screen was no
larger than 400 pixels.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.600
Then, I needed another media query that
set the background-color to blue when

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.340
the screen was no
smaller than 600 pixels.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.780
And then finally, I needed to set
the background-color to green for

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.380
screens between these two break points.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.910
I went ahead and did it by setting the
background-color to green before these

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.040
two media queries.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.175
This way, the CSS cascade kicks in,

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:35.485
and it's only applied, this color here,
when these two break points are not.

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:38.985
Of course, I easily could have put
background-color green into a media

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:41.825
query, but well, I didn't need to.

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:47.575
And there it is, blue, green, and red.

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:48.445
That wasn't too difficult.
