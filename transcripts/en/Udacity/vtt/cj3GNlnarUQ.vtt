00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
There are two major types of malware.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.130
The first kind of malware needs
host program, meaning that

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.440
they have to be embedded in the host
program in order to run and spread.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.570
The second type of malware is
independent, meaning that they themself

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.980
are independent programs
that can run by themself.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.630
We will study some of
them in this lecture and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.246
cover the rest in the next lecture.

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.820
When we say a malware
needs a host program,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.190
we mean that the malware is
embedded in the existing program so

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.300
that you can enter program, runs on
the system and then spread from there.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.010
There are several ways for
malware to imbed itself into a program.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.401
For example, trap doors,
logic bombs, trojan horses,

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:53.090
viruses, and malicious browser plugins
and extensions and scripts and so on.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.400
And the independent malware
does not need a host program,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.240
because this malware are complete
programs by themself.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.091
Examples of these malware include worms,
botnets,

00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:10.200
and advanced persistent threats,
or APTs.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.790
We will discuss botnets and
APTs in a later lesson.
