00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; You saw though that neither the range nor the IQR take all the data into

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.400
account. We could have two totally different data sets with the same IQR. Like

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.467
these. A normal, a bimodal, and a uniform distribution. So the IQR doesn't tell

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:22.818
us as much as we would like to know about the dataset. Remember how we used all

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:28.362
of our data when calculating the mean because remember with the mean we took the

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:33.514
sum of all the values and then divided by the number of values. So that used

00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:38.282
every data value. What if we were to take a similar approach when calculating

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:42.983
our variability? In other words, we need one number that decribes the spread of

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:47.460
data that takes all the data into account. Let's go through some scenarios.
