00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.115
Sales of Grant's packs of 12 nozzles have really taken off. In fact, he's been

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.745
doing so well selling these bulk packages, that he's only going to sell nozzles

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:13.749
by the dozen now. That does mean, though, that depending on how many nozzles he

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:18.930
has total, he might have some left over. For example, if Grant has 40 nozzles

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.267
total, then that will make 3 and 1 3rd packages of 12 nozzles. Since if we take

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:29.398
40 and divide it by 12, we get 3 and a 3rd. And we can see these 3 whole

00:00:29.398 --> 00:00:34.900
packages of 12 nozzles, but then there's this 1 3rd of a package left over.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.110
Grant can't sell 1 3rd of a package. So, this 3 and a 3rd packages really only

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.136
counts as 3 for him. So, it's almost as if we're taking this 3 and a 3rd and

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:47.610
rounding it down to the nearest integer, 3. So, let's say that x equals the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.144
actual number of packs of nozzles we have. So, for example in this case, we

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:56.262
have 3 and 3rd packs of nozzles. And let's say that y equals the number of

00:00:56.262 --> 00:01:01.792
packs of nozzles that Grant can actually sell. So, in this case, that was 3. We

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:05.158
can represent this relationship between the actual number of packages we have

00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:08.422
and the number Grant can sell by something that's called the Floor Function,

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:13.849
also known as the Greatest Integer Function. The notation for the equation is

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:18.137
this, y equals x inside these double square brackets, which basically means

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:22.358
that the y value is equal to the greatest integer that is less than or equal to

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:28.557
the corresponding x value. But what do you think the graph of the 4 function

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:32.838
looks like? Which of these graphs do you think properly represents the floor

00:01:32.838 --> 00:01:36.946
function? Remember that we want the y value to round x down to the nearest

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:41.542
integer. I know that from our way it might be hard to tell these graphs apart.

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:44.315
So, below them I've shown a blown up version for you of what each of these

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:48.291
steps looks like. Please notice the difference between the 2 in terms of which

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:51.339
circles are empty and which circles are colored in.
