00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.350
How about a really, really simple model?

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.930
Would you like a really simple model?

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.070
Well, of course, you would because who
wants a complicated model if you can

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.029
have a simple model?

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:08.690
All right.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.460
Suppose we just start off with a patch,
a location at some point: x, y.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.775
All right.

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:14.905
So, we're going to say, all right.

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:19.965
I've got some patch at x, y, and
my dynamics is going to be random noise.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.435
So what that means is, is that's
the same model that they use for

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:23.575
the head contour.

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:24.845
We're not going to track velocity,

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:28.713
we're just going to assume that
the position changes randomly.

00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:31.850
Okay, so as you add your particles
you assume zero velocity so

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.520
they stay where they are and
you would add random noise.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.925
And then, how about the very
simplest of sensor models.

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:42.040
Okay, you just take the mean
square difference, right?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.790
So what this says is if I propose that
the state of the object is here, and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.520
it, it used to be here,
I'm just going to compare the patch.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.710
I'm literally going to
subtract the two patches, and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.630
say what's the mean squared error.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.450
Okay?
That would be,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.140
sort of the simplest
sensor model possible.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.510
You could do a slightly more
sophisticated one, right?

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.280
You could do a normalized correlation.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.400
You've already learned about
this when we did stereo.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.680
And you could say the higher
the correlation the more likely or

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.860
the bigger the sum of the square
differences the less likely.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.180
That would be your simp, sensor model.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.360
So to this,
all you would need is a patch.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.790
So there's a patch.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.970
So those of you who are from
the United States or know U.S.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.920
politics, that's Mitt Romney.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.528
The reason I'm showing you this is
that we provided to the students who

00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:31.197
are going to be doing problem sets in,
in the original class I'm going and

00:01:31.197 --> 00:01:33.050
the OMS class a video.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.730
Okay?

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.910
And this is the patch, grabbed out
of a section of one of the frames.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.360
And your goal is to see with a particle
filter, how long can you track

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.300
Mitt Romney until he until it falls
off and he loses the election.
