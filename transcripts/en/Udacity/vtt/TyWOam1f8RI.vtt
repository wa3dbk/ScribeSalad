00:00:00.635 --> 00:00:03.270
So, one way of doing this is to draw a square

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.330
and then turn a little bit to the right and then

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.610
draw another square. And then turn a little bit to the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.820
right again and then draw another square. And keep doing that. Let's

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.520
build that. So, here's the piece of code that draws a

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.760
square. And after I've done that, what I want the turtle to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.980
do is turn a little bit to the right. So, let

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.880
me add a piece of code that says brad.right, let's say by

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.390
ten degrees. Now, because I want these two statements to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.570
happen over and over again, I will put them inside a loop. So let me do that. So

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.680
I'm going to add a for loop by saying for i in range, let's say this

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.670
loop runs four times. I'll add a colon and then put these two

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.030
things inside the loop. Let me save, and run, and see

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.600
what happens. Ah-ha, so here is the output. We've drawn two squares,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.020
three squares and it should stop, there it is four squares. So all I have to

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.180
do now, is let the turtle keep going around the circle, which has 360 degrees.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.770
So, this loop should run not four times, but 36

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.720
times instead. Let me save and

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.773
run that. All right. There it is, folks. A circle made out of squares. Now

00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:26.356
I'm going to put some background music behind this

00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:28.702
video and let you enjoy our final creation.
