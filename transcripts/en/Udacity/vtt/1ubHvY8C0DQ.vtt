00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.391
Well, slope is run over run, or y2 minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1. So the slope

00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:12.507
of this first line is just 2. We rise 2 and then run 1 to the right. The slope

00:00:12.507 --> 00:00:18.475
of this line is one half. We rise up 1 unit and then 2 units to the right for

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:22.732
the run. I'm noticing a pattern here. Do you see it?
