00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.230
So far we've created our object and
built up the list of events to listen

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.360
for, let's figure out what happens
when we trigger one of those events.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.930
We need a break point here so

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.770
that Chrome will pause when
we try to trigger the event.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.200
These lines pull out
the arguments that are passed.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.350
In our case that's an event, so

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.320
the arcs variable will be in a ray
with the string and event in it.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.740
Then it calls the events API function,
just like it did when we used on.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.960
This time trigger API will
be used as the iteratee.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.070
Just like before, events API checks if
the event name is an object, a list,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.440
or just a single word.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.740
Then it calls iteratee,
which is the trigger API function.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.080
Trigger API pulls the callback
out of the event object and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.820
then passes the call back and
the arguments to trigger events.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.900
Just like the on method,
most of the time is spent setting and

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.520
passing along data.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.270
This function here is what actually
runs the callback function and the data.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.110
This first line sets up
a bunch of local variables.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.080
Then it checks how many
arguments were passed.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.260
In our case that's just one,
so it jumps to here.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.670
And it pulls out the event out of the
events array, gets the call back, and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.580
calls it with the argument.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.860
After that, Backbone just unwinds and
returns all the way up the chain.
