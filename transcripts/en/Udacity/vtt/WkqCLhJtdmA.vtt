00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.110
So Andrea, we've set up a good
foundation for our app and

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.920
now we're ready to add
in the vocab words.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.020
&gt;&gt; Do you have an idea of
what words we can include?

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.953
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I came up with a list of words,
here they are.

00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:11.352
&gt;&gt; Cool, this is great.

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:14.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah, at one point I was thinking
about using words for animals and

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.710
places, but I figured that
phrases would be more useful.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.003
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think phrases will be fun for
our students to learn.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.434
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:25.401
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:26.667
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sounds great.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.980
So Jessica, how do we go ahead and
build the next step of the app?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
there's a lot of words on this list.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.060
How about we just focus on
the first category for now, so

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.470
the numbers category.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.640
&gt;&gt; I see, so
we get the numbers list working and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.560
then we can just repeat the same pattern
for the family, phrases and color words.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.305
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so let's revisit the
course map and I can give our students

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:47.106
an overview of what we're
going to cover in this lesson.

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:48.280
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN].

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.370
&gt;&gt; So right now we're in
lesson two out of four.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.050
So here are the details of what
we're going to cover in Lesson 2.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.310
So first, we're going to learn about how
to store a list of words in the app,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.950
and we're going to talk about data
structures, such as Arrays and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.350
ArrayLists to help us store these words.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.070
Next, we'll learn how to
display a list of words.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.200
And here's an example of what that
looks like in our numbers activity.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.920
Then we'll go on to display a list
of English and Miwok word pairs.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.450
And here's what that looks
like in the numbers activity.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.710
And lastly, we'll get to add the words
from all the remaining categories.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.170
So here's a sneak peek of what that
looks like in all the activities.
