00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
First we're going to look at a protocol that's not quite TLS.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This'll give you a basic idea of how TLS works, but there is some vulnerability in the protocol,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which we'll talk about fixing next.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Here's our client, which is typically a web browser, and a our server, which is a web server.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The first step in the protocol is the client connects to the server, sending a message "hello"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
--without the exclamation point.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It also sends information about what ciphers it is able to use.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Different versions of browsers will have different ciphers implemented.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The server and the client need to agree on a particular server

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The client will also send a list of the ciphers and the hash functions that it has implemented.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Different browsers will have different ciphers implemented.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's up to the client and server to agree on the one to use.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In the second step, the server responds.  That response includes several things.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It will pick the cipher and the hash function to use.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Those'll be selected from the list that the client sent based on the ones the server can use.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It should pick the strongest ones that are acceptable to both.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It also sends a certificate.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What that certificate is is something that gives the public key of the server to the client

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
in a way that the client can trust it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What's in the certificate is the domain, the name of the server,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
as well as its public key.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There is some other information like expiration times--these certificates expire.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The important thing about the certificate is that it's signed by a certificate authority.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We'll talk more about certificates later, but the important thing the certificate does

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
is give the client access to the servers public key

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in a way that the client can trust it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The next step is for the client to verify the certificate.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Since the certificate is signed by the private key of some certificate authority,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that means the client needs the corresponding public key to verify the signature.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The client also extracts the public key from that certificate.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The next thing the client will do is select a random number--

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
some random value that will be used to generate the session key.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
In the third step the client wants to send back that random value to the server,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but in a way that's secure.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Let's make that a quiz to see if you can figure out how to do that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The question is how should the client securely send the random value to the server.

00:02:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check the best answer from the list below.
