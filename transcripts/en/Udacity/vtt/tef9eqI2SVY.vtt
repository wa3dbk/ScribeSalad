00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.652
When we do a one-tailed test, the p value is the probability above the t

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:11.598
statistic if it's positive, and below the t statistic if it's negative. But for

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:16.270
a two-tailed test, the p value is both the probability above that t statistic

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.819
And the probablity less than the negative value of that T statistic. If we had

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:27.463
gotten a negative T statistic to begin with it'd be the same thing. The T value

00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:31.349
would be the sum of the probablity below that T statistic and above the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.354
positive value of that T statistic. We reject the null, when the p-value is

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:42.504
less than the alpha level. Let's say we have the following sample. Is this

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:48.160
sample mean significantly different from 10 at an alpha level of 0.5? First,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.453
calculate the t-statistic. Remember to use the sample standard deviation for s.
