00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.660
So we have seen our Function Inlining quiz.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.980
Now let's talk about its solution. After scheduling, how many cycles?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.720
Well, let's see first what the scheduling will do. We have a load.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.820
We have to do it before the call. And after the call we can do the store.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.620
So really scheduling can do nothing here. Here we need to do the multiplication.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.090
And then, the ADD depends on it. And then, we can only return. So really there

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.830
is nothing scheduling can do here. So really we just need to figure out for

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.830
this sequence of instructions. How many cycles does it take to do it?

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.220
One way of doing that would be to say that the load begins in the first cycle.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.400
In the second cycle it's still going on. So, we can use the result in

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.520
the third cycle. In the second cycle, however, we can do the call. The call also

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.570
takes two cycles, so we're really can execute this instruction in cycle four.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.672
At that time, A0 is available. The multiplication takes three cycles. So

00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:59.492
in cycles four, five, and six, the multiplication is happening. And

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:02.619
only cycle seven can we do this because it's using the result of

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.258
this instruction. We can build a return immediately afterwards. So

00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:13.127
return now is happening in cycles eight and nine. And finally in cycle ten we

00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:17.170
are back here. And then the store of course takes only one cycle, so

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.690
really after ten cycles we are done. Now let us see what the inlining will do.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.920
What it will do is it will simply take these two instructions and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.450
replace the call with them. Now let's see, can we do some scheduling around it?

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.000
We need to load A0. Then we're going to use it in multiplication.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.472
Then we are going to use it in the addition. And

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:40.270
then, we are going to use the result on it in the store. So again,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.490
scheduling is going to help us here. However, we have eliminated the call and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.980
the return. So now what happens is we have the load begins in cycle one.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.830
Next, we will try to do the multiplication but we can only do it in cycle three.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.700
Because the load needs to produce the value for two cycles in cycles one and

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.900
two before we can use it. Next, we have the multiplication happening in

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.270
cycles three, four and five. So we can only do this in cycle six.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.224
The add only takes one cycle. And the store can then happen in cycle seven. And

00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:15.640
that's when it finishes. So after inlining and scheduling, we have reduced this

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.440
to seven cycles, mainly by eliminating the call and the return.
