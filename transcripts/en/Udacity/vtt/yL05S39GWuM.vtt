00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.780
Other than HIEs operated by what
are essentially a very large scale

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.620
health enterprise, such as
the Kaiser HMO or the VA Health System,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.490
I couldn't provide another example
of centralized HIE at the scope and

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.700
sophistication of IHIE.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.240
Why has Indiana been able to do it?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.850
A big part of the answer is the
Regenstrief Foundation that supported

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.140
the development of the technology and
the HIE over a period of many years.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.280
Without that unusual support,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.990
we might not have an IHIE to
be proud of and point to.
