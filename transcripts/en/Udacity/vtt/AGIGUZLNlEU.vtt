00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.505
Unfortunately, sometimes requests fail.

00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:13.381
[NOISE] There are many reasons this could happen.

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.094
And it's important that your app take into account errors so

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:19.750
that it doesn't completely break if an AJAX request doesn't work.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.250
jQuery gives us the .error method,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.830
which we can change to the AJAX request we made earlier.

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:30.100
This .error method goes into effect if the AJAX request fails for

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.240
whatever reason.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.030
For this quiz, set up error handling for the New York Times request.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.800
Your app should display New York Times articles could not be loaded,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.620
if the request fails.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.630
To test error handling, there are a few different ways you can do it.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.650
For one, you could simply load the website and then disconnect your internet.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.410
That will definitely fail.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.780
Or you could always purposely mess up the URL.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.600
In which case it's definitely going fail because nyasdftimes.com is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.770
definitely not the website we're looking for.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.850
If all goes well, or rather should I say if all goes wrong,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.230
you should see this message appear on the page.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.897
Check the link in the instructor notes for more on the .error method.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.610
Try chaining the jQuery.error method to the end of your AJAX request and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.300
that should take care of any failing request.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.100
Check here when you're done.
