00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's discuss a network ideas example,
SNORT.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.120
SNORT is open source, very easy
to configure and very efficient.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.180
SNORT can be easily deployed on most
nodes of a network, including end host,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.219
server, or even a router.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.970
It uses a small amount of memory and
processor time.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.670
SNORT is very easy to learn, and
very easily configured by sys admins.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.410
SNORT can perform real time packet
captures, particle analysis, and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.180
content searching on the packet.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.935
SNORT can detect a variety of intrusions

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.575
based on the rules that
are configured by a sys admin.

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:41.475
In fact, there's a community who
maintains a very large set of SNORT

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:45.735
rules that can be further configured
by sys admin for his network.
