00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.360
So my entrepreneurial experience.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.550
I found it's abundantly obvious
when you need to hire somebody.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.430
So you kind of go on, you have this
idea, you're working on it really hard.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.540
You get some users,
you get some traction and

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.535
the thing that gives you the most pain
is the thing that you need to hire for

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:19.285
and for me it was always operations.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:23.425
And just like doing deals,
advertising, getting any,

00:00:23.425 --> 00:00:26.005
I mentioned earlier that
were in Apple retail.

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.964
That was just this woman that I hired
that just miraculously made it happen.

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:33.863
It was huge lots of phone calls and
meetings and so the thing about it is

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:37.427
you need to find the people that
are going to fill in your gaps and

00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:40.140
they become,
I like to go until it's painful.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.300
I've done their job for a little bit so
I know what to look for but

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.860
I hate it enough that I know I need
to get somebody else to do it.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.470
But I really recommend,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.740
I've seen entrepreneurs do this
where they will actually just go,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.450
well I need to be the person before
they've actually felt that pain.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.802
Like they think this is the playbook,
they read a book somewhere or

00:00:58.802 --> 00:01:01.070
they heard from video or
they read the story of another company.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.404
Every company is unique and
especially in the early days and so

00:01:04.404 --> 00:01:08.505
your strengths are unique, so what you
need to hire first off is probably not

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:11.540
what any other company needed
to hire right off the bat.
