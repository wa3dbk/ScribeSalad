00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.210
Let's see if we can do another one. 
What if we have h of x equals one over x

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.606
squared plus three? 
If we want to write this as f of g of x,

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:12.557
what are g and f? 
Now just to tell you, there isn't only

00:00:12.557 --> 00:00:15.900
one right answer here. 
See if you can find more than one.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.524
This is the perfect chance to use some 
creative thinking and play around with

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:19.570
your math.
