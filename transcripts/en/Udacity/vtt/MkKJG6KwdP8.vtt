00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.560
Here we are,
ready to tackle completion closures.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.090
We've seen many in other people's code,
but

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.410
now we're finally ready
to write our own.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.700
Writing a method that takes a closure
as a parameter has a wacky syntax, but

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.380
don't worry, we have a great tool
called www.goshdarnclosuresyntax.com.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.630
Let's take a look at it.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.017
This is www.goshdarnclosuresyntax.com,
and

00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:29.269
it's a list of all the different ways
that you can declare a closure in Swift.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:36.660
So you have as a variable,
optional variable, type alias, etc.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.770
The one we're actually interested
in is argument to a function call.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.310
So we want a function that takes
a closure as one of its parameters or

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.740
arguments.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.790
There is another version of this site
with a far more memorable name, but

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.110
our lawyers told me I couldn't use it.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.470
Finding it is left as an exercise
to the interested student.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.310
Anyway, let's get back to Xcode.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.480
Now we're going to write
a method called withBigImage

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.990
that takes a completitionHandler
as a parameter.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.260
What will this method do?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.760
It's going to download
the image in the background and

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.270
once it's finished, once it's done,
it will run the completion handler.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.061
The completion function closure, or
handler, however you want to call it,

00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:28.530
is what it should do with
this image once it has it.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.290
So let's get started.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.420
This is the signature for
the withBigImage method.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.860
It takes one parameter and
this parameter has two different names,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.385
an internal name called handler, and an
external one called completion handler.

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:46.675
But the important stuff is here.

00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:53.505
It returns nothing, but
it takes one parameter, a UI image.

00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:57.305
That's because since it's going
to do something with a UI image,

00:01:57.305 --> 00:02:04.100
it must have access to that UI image
that this method is going to provide.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.540
So the completion handler must

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.820
take as a parameter the image
that has been downloaded.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.270
Next, we will have to fill in the code,
and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.630
it's going to be very similar
to what we wrote previously.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.310
We are going to need to create a
download queue, and then we're going to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.360
add to that queue a closure that
downloads the queue in the background.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.825
And then we will finally, once we're
done, we're going to run this handler.

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:38.015
And you can start thinking right
now in which queue do you think

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:40.975
that the completion handler should run?

00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:42.745
Let me write the code and
we'll get there.

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:47.165
Okay, this first step is
to call the spare chasing.

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:49.145
And we need also a queue,

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:53.390
but this time we're not going
to create a queue from scratch,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.240
we're going to reuse one of those four
queues that the system allocates for

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.920
each application on iOS, and we need to
choose also the priority of this queue.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.660
It depends, if it's something very
urgent, something that has been

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.690
initiated by the user,
then it should get a decent priority.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.470
If it's something that can wait,
then you could give it a lower priority.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.620
But first we need to get this queue.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.095
The first parameter for

00:03:21.095 --> 00:03:26.770
dispatch_get_global_queue is
something called the identifier

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.330
that's actually a constant that
gives you the priority of the queue.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.510
This QOS by the way means "quality
of service." Class_Background,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.290
that means pretty bad
quality of service.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.350
It's going to have low priority.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.905
And user_interactive is
the top priority and

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:50.005
user_initiated is the normal
hold priority, I'll set that.

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:54.565
And the flags,
those are not being used right now.

00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:59.285
That has been set up for the future,
so right now you should pass zero.

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:02.980
And we have the closure.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.870
So within this code,
that's where we have to get the URL,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.210
download the NS data,
turn it into a UI image,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.220
and then, once we have the image,
run the completion handler.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.760
Let's write, this should be
familiar by now, but let's write it.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.650
So here's the code that we've been
writing over and over and over,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.230
it's encapsulated in
a nice if-let statement so

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.500
nothing evil will
happen if we get a nil.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.320
The only thing that is left is to
run the completion closure, and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.890
that's just like calling any closure or
function.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.570
So it would be handler, image,
and the image that we downloaded.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.300
Now look carefully at this code and

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.540
think if this is wise,
if this is a good idea.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.140
Everything that is running

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.570
inside this closure is running
in the background queue.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.510
However, completion handlers or
completion closures

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.440
are usually used to update the UI, so

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.540
they will very likely use an axis UIKit.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.990
So this is definitely not a good idea,
okay?

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.890
It might crash if whatever code
is in that handler, we don't know

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.330
exactly what's in there, because we
get it as a parameter, as a black box,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.290
if that accesses UIKit,
this code will crash definitely.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.750
So it's a good practice
to make sure that always

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.940
all your completion handlers
run in the main queue.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.000
This is not a rule, but
It's a very good practice.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.150
Make sure that always,
all your completion handlers,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.050
those that you write,
run in the main queue.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.140
When you get a library
from a third party, and

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.920
it has completion handlers,
you should check the documentation to

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.520
make sure where those
completion handlers are run.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.360
The usual is the main queue.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.086
So we need to wrap this code here,
in a dispatch_async,

00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:20.330
dispatch_get_main_queue, and
then call the completionHandler.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.250
This should be trivial by now.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.570
Let's finish it.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.000
Here it is, we call dispatch_async,
as usual, then dispatch_get_main_queue,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.540
because we want to run the next closure,
within the main queue.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.460
And inside this closure we will
run the completion handler, so

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.890
this way we're also hopping
from one queue to the other.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.260
We hop to a background queue here.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.550
Then when we have the image,
we go to the main queue and

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.750
run the completion handler.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.262
And either if this completion
handler uses UIKit or not,

00:06:57.262 --> 00:07:00.270
it's okay, the code will not crash.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.870
And now we're finally done.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.160
No, hang on there, this is a very good
moment for you to go and take a look

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.460
at the black box code that hides
the reality of GCD from most students.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.770
It should be obvious to you right now.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.240
Just by staring at the code,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.290
you should be able to see
the lady in the red dress.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.910
And there's extra nerdy points for
you if you know what I'm talking about.
