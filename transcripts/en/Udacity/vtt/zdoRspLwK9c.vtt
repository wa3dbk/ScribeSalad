00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.874
So, now this is something we should recognize. We have a quadratic equation on

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:08.876
the right side, and 0 on the left side. So let's see if you can solve this

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:13.124
quadratic equation. When you think you have the answers, enter them here and

00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:15.179
write your answer as a set.
