00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.280
Now, another part of the script was the track. And

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.689
we really haven't talked a lot about track so far. So let's talk a little bit

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.941
more about it. So here are four tracks with the restaurant script.

00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:13.070
That really [INAUDIBLE] to going to restaurant, four kinds.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.100
Here's a coffeehouse, fast food, casual dining, formal dining. You could add

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.740
more if you wanted to. Now in restaurants of all kinds, some even so common.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.280
You have to go to a restaurant, you have to order some food. You eat that food.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.750
You pay the bill. And then you leave. That is common to all of them which is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.890
why all of them are part of the restaurant script. On the other hand what

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.240
happens in a Coffeehouse is quite different from what happens in Formal Dining,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.350
which is quite different from what happens in a Fast Food restaurant.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.520
So you may have specific cracks that correspond to Coffeehouses and

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.280
Fast Foods and so on. In effect, we are building a semantic hierarchy or script.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.970
Here is a script for going to a restaurant. Here is a script for going to

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.270
a coffeehouse, going to fast food. And this can be tracks in the overall script.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.780
Of course, we can build a semantic hierarchy of something higher than this.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.156
We could think about going to, for social events and [INAUDIBLE] going to this

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:04.828
restaurant becomes part of going to a social event of various kind. Okay now

00:01:04.828 --> 00:01:08.710
that we know something about the [UNKNOWN] representation called script,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.659
the next question becomes how many AI agent actually use these scripts? So

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.196
imagine an AI agent that is hungry has some money and

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:19.220
decides to do something about it. So it may go into its long term memory and

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.210
find out the script that will be most useful for

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.980
the current situation. This really becomes a classification problem.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.480
In long term memory a large number of scripts, and

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.550
the agent is trying to classify the current situation into one of those scripts.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.950
Let us suppose the agent picks a restaurant script, and decides to execute it.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.470
As it enters the restaurant, the scene it observes in the restaurant matches

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.380
the conditions of a fast food script. So it decides to invoke the fast food

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.170
script. This way the robot may walk down the semantic hierarchy,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170
first in working the restaurant script, then working the fast food script, and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.640
so on. Now a robot could have taken a different stance.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.080
A robot could have decided to do planning. Given some initial conditions, and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.780
cold conditions, a robot may have used the operative that is available to it,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.780
to generate a plan at one time. While the script is doing it, it is giving it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.042
a plan in a compiled form. The robot doesn't have to generate this plan at

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:14.570
runtime. It is already available in memory in a pre stored form. This is very

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.910
useful because one of the central conundrums that we have been talking about is,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.340
how is it possible that AI agents can't address computationally complex problems

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.495
with limited resources in near real time? In a complex dynamic world,

00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:31.610
planning can take a lot of time. But if I already have the store plans,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.350
then in working the script and executing it is much faster.
