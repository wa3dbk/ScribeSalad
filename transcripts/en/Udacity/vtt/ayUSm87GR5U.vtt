00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Rob Pike, Google Engineer:] There is a standard problem, especially when you're learning to program.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You have a piece of code on the page, and it doesn't work.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You read it and you study it and you don't see what's wrong.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then it often helps in practice to just explain the code to somebody else.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Sometimes just hearing yourself say it out loud you'll go, oh, I know what I did wrong--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
just explaining what's not working or why.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's such a common technique that there's a--I think it was a computer center

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
at one of the universities--they had a teddy bear on the desk at the help desk.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Before you were allowed to talk to an actual person,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you had to explain your problem to the teddy bear,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
because chances were just saying it out loud to the teddy bear would show you

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
what was wrong with your program.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
[Niniane Wang, CTO, Minted:] The more you like something, the more you'll naturally want to do it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I would say do not force yourself to do something, because other people are doing it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If everyone or if a bunch of people are talking about mobile programming

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
or functional programming or functional programming languages

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or Lisp or front-end programming,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
if you try it and you don't like it, you should not try to force yourself to do that.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[Sally Goldman, Professor, Washington Univ:] In the end, good code is code that other people can come

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and change and adapt.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
[Learning to Program]

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Guido van Rossum, Author Python language:] I wasn't quite that ambitious.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I initially just thought that I need another programming language.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I definitely meant it to be a general purpose language.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
ABC actually sort of had multiple philosophies.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It wanted to be easy to teach and easy to learn,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
but it also wanted to be a language that was useful for just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
slightly non-professional computer users.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I just liked a lot of thing is the ABC language as a professional programmer.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I started copying those ideas and sort of changing them, mutating the ideas

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and the details of the language of the implementation.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Alex Martelli, Tech Lead, Google:] Back when I joined it was the 1.52 version,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so it had been already growing pretty pragmatically for a while.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It was still in a phase of a tumult of new ideas and a general attitude in this small group

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
of core committers of, hey, one more feature--how could it hurt?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
At some point, essentially moving towards the 2.0 release, a sobering sense

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that Python wasn't a toy language used by people for their own fun anymore.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It was starting to become the material to build in very complex, important software system.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
In the process of designing Python 3, we did actually--as the core Python developer group--

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
we did a lot of soul-searching and thinking about which parts of the language

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and which parts of the library can we improve.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Using def to introduce a function--what does this mean? Define? Define what?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Unfortunately, I have to admit that JavaScript has it right here.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The proper keyword to introduce a function is "function."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Why use--to save four letters? That's not the Python spirit.
