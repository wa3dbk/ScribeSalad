00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.300
Let's update the view
will appear function so

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.390
that the stop recording button is
disabled right from the start.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.960
Take out the print line and
now the following to view will appear.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.490
Let's make the stop recording
button disabled by default.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.420
Now we need to wait to enable
the stop recording button and

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.010
at the same time disable
the record button.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.810
There are two functions you wrote
earlier that can help us here,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.400
in the record audio function,
we can add the following two lines.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.270
One line to enable the stop
recording button and

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.230
the second line to disable
the record button.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.800
Finally in the stop recording function,
we can add the following three lines.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.010
We can set the record button back to
enable, we can disable the recording

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.860
button, and we can reset
the text on the recording label.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.750
Let's test it.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.120
We can run that by clicking
the run button up here or

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.590
pressing command r on your keyboard.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.530
We can see right away that the stop
recording button has been disabled

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.330
when the view loads.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.800
If you click record we can
see the label has changed and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.160
now the stop recording buttons enabled.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.580
At the same time the recording button

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.630
is disabled because we're
actually recording.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.270
If we hit stop this button
is unable to get in and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.281
the label has changed
back to Tap to Record.
