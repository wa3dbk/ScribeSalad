00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This brings us to a point where we can ask one of the most fundamental questions in theoretical

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
computer science and that is does P=NP and in particular, here's what we actually know.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is true. We know that every problem that's in P is in NP and every problem that is NP is in EXP,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that is to say any problem that you can solve in polynomial time,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we can certainly solve in non-deterministic polynomial time,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and any problem that we can solve in a non-deterministic polynomial time,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we can also solve in exponential time, but here's what we don't know.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It could be the case that the class NP is actually equal to the class EXP.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That is to say the set of problems that we can solve in a non-deterministic polynomial time

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
might be exactly the same as the ones that we can solve in exponential time.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So there's a sort of outer set and that's distinct from say this inner set,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which is the set of problems that are solvable in polynomial time.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There's one other thing that we know, we do know that there really

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is a difference between polynomial and exponential time.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
There's some problems that can be solved in exponential time that are definitely not NP.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So we know those two things are different, but we don't really know.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It could be that NP is equal to x. It could also that P is equal to NP.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So the problems that we can solve in a non-deterministic polynomial time

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
might be exactly the same as the ones that we can solve in polynomial time,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
which both would be then different from exponential time

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or could very well be that there are really three different categories here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That problems that are in NP don't necessarily require exponential time,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but they may not be solvable in polynomial time either--we don't know.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So this question of whether or not P=NP, whether we're in this case here is a pretty heavy question.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So what happens if P does equal NP. Well, a lot people say a lot of different things.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's turn this into a quiz to see what you think.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So one possibility is that cryptographic protocols, so things were keeping secrets in encrypting data

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that are based on problems like factoring that are in NP could be cracked.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Another is that there's a whole lot of computer science theoreticians

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
who will be suddenly out of work because they will no longer be having to think about this problem.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Another possible outcome might be that with P equal to NP

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that means the computers will be smarter than people.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They will be able to solve problems fast that people can't.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So I don't know, just tell me which one you think is true.
