[Norvig] Here's my answer. First I defined all the ranks.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That had been a constant that we had in the program before,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but I'm going to have to refer to it a couple times, so I called it out and gave it a name.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Then I defined all the red cards and all the black cards.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Those are what we're going to substitute for the various jokers.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And then here's best<u>wild</u>hand.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So what I did is I said let's apply this function replacement

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to each of the cards in hand. Here's what replacement does.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Replacement takes a card and replaces or comes up with a list of possibilities for that card.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So if the card is a black joker, then it can be replaced with all the black cards.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If the card is a red joker, it can be replaced with all the red cards.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Otherwise it can replace only with itself, and we'll make that a list

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because the interface here is that you give me 1 card and I give you a list

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of all the cards it can be replaced with.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, what am I doing here? This looks a little bit tricky.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What I'm saying is I'm calling itertools.product.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let me explain to you what product does.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The product function takes any number of lists,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or in fact they can be iterables, and here we're just going to try 2,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so the product of ([1, 2, 3] , [100, 200].

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Product stands for cross product, so we'd have all ways of taking 1 item from this list

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and 1 item from this list.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So that would return a list, and the pairs of items are put into tuples,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so it would be [(1, 100), (1, 200), (2, 100), (2, 200), (3, 100), (3, 200)].

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So however many lists it's given, it picks out 1 element from each,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
puts that into a tuple, and does that for every possible combination

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of elements from a, b, and whatever else there is there.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So what we've done here is we've called replacement on each card in the hand,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and that gives us a list of possibilities for each of the cards.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If the card is not a joker, that list will be 1.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
If the card is a joker, then it will be all the red cards or all the black cards.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So now we have the product of that.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So for all the 7 cards in the hand we've got this big product,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and we go through and we take all the possibilities

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and then for each one of those possibilities, h, we pick out the best hand

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
using the process that we did before, and that gives us a set of possible hands.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And then we go through those hands using hand_rank.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
These hands are now the 5-card hands determined by best_hand,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and we take the maximum again according to hand_rank,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and that gives us the best out of those 5 cards.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
For both of these solutions to the homework problems

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I was able to come up with a small amount of code

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because I knew about existing routines in the standard Python library.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
If you didn't know about those routines and if you wrote a lot of lines of code

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
rather than just 1 or 2, don't feel bad.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You got the practice doing that, and I'm sure your code was good and did the right job.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So you should feel proud that you got it working,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but you should also learn this lesson--

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that you should try to familiarize yourself with the tools that already exist

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and use them when appropriate.
