00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.812
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We start with our point-slope form. Our slope is 2 3rds, x 1 is 1, and y 1 is

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:09.425
2. I can drop the parenthesis, and now we can cross multiply. Then I can

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:14.604
distribute, and I get 2x minus 2, equals 3y minus 6. I've written this equation

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:19.556
again, up here, and now I put it in standard form. I add 2 to both sides, to get

00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:24.598
2x equals 3y minus 4, and then I subtract 3y from both sides. So 2x minus 3y is

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:30.138
equal to negative 4. Here's our perpendicular line. That's some serious algebra,

00:00:30.138 --> 00:00:32.719
so if you got it right, excellent work.
