00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.660
Nice work.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.450
In this section, you've learned
what a Progressive Web App is, and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.250
why it's a great solution for
your users.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.600
Whether they're connecting with
a fast fiber connection, or

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.580
on a slow 2G connection.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.340
But more importantly, you've started
building a Progressive Web App.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.200
You've used the App Shell model to
separate the app from the content, and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.930
you've weighed the pros and
cons of different storage techniques

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.815
to store user preferences like the list
of cities the user cares about.

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:38.715
In the next section, you'll be adding a
service worker to cash your up shell and

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:43.155
the weather forecast data, ensuring
that your app is blazing fast and

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:44.705
works offline.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:45.305
See you then.
