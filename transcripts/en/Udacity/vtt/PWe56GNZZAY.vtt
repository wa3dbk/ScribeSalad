00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.090
In this final exam problem, we are given a

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.810
regular language in the form of a non-deterministic finite state

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.630
machine, and we want to construct another non-deterministic finite state

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.030
machine that accepts exactly the same strings, but backwards. So,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.780
let's say we have this regular expression that accepts

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.490
strings that begin with an a and end with a

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.660
c and in between, have one or more occurrences of

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.170
bx and by. An example string that that regular expression

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.330
matches looks like this. a, bx, bx,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.550
by, and c. So we do a, bx, by, and then c. So

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.260
here I have a finite state machine representation of that regular expression. We

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.430
start with an a, we require at least one bx or by. And then we can repeat

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.100
the bx and by afterwards as many times as we want, and we finish with a c.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.720
Remembe,r the finite state machine we want to generate

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.185
will have to accept strings like this, where we begin

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:59.495
with a c, we then have yb, xb, xb,

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:02.810
and then a. Our strategy for doing that is going

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.870
to be basically reversing all of the edges. In

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.710
this finite state machine, to go the other direction, and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.670
finishing it off by changing the start state with

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.160
the accepting state. Okay, so the first thing I'm going to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.900
do is change the start state and the accepting state.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.210
So now we start at 6, and finish at 1,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.980
and now I'm going to change all of the arrows. And

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.420
we're done. If you look closely, you'll see that this

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.440
finite state machine. Matches exactly the same set as the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.470
original one, finite state machine, but backwards. So, let's apply

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.160
that same methodology to coding our solution. So, I've started

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.200
coding the solution, and the first thing I do is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
create a dictionary to contain the reversed edges, and I switch

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.410
the start and accepting states. Now I'm going to go through each

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.220
of the original edges, and right here on these three lines,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.230
I'm just extracting the data from the original edge and the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.790
original finite state machine to make it easier to manipulate later.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090
So, for this edge in the original finance state machine I'm

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.820
looking at, I'm going to go through each of its destinations, so

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.930
that I'm going to create an edge that goes the other direction.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.410
And because the way we structure a data structure. I'm going

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.690
to have to do it in kind of a continuing fashion. I

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.080
can't just finish the edge. I have to look at every edge

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.940
in the original one before I can be certain that I've finished

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.890
the edge in the new finite state machine. So this line of

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.410
code sees if we've already created the beginning of this edge, and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.960
that's going to overwrite the empty list we had before. And either

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.930
way, we're gong to set the new state of this edge in

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.710
the new finite state machine to be the concatenation

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.900
of the before list with the added state we got

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.350
from this iteration. And once we're done going through

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.800
the original finite state machine, we just return the result.
