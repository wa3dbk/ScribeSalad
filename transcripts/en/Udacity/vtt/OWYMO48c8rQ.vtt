00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.719
Now we turn our attention to the Transport layer, which

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.960
sits between the Network layer and the Application layer. The

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.910
key contribution of this layer, is the notion of ports,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.380
which tells the OS which process the data is intended for.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.525
On a Linux machine, you can see this mapping using

00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:19.360
LSOF-I. Having multiple ports allows more than one application to

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.020
receive data from the network at once, something called multiplex.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.500
Port numbers are 16 bits long, and many of them are

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.770
reserved for special purposes. Port 80, for instance, is

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.150
typically the one used for receiving HTTP requests, like a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.335
browser would send. In fact, we'll use this as an

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.080
example. Let's say we're running Chrome, and that we visit

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.490
the Udacity homepage. Then Chrome will ask the operating system

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.760
for a port number that it can use, or it'll

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.050
pick one that has been allocated already. Let's say the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.040
port number is 55804. It sends, then sends the request

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.350
in a packet with a source port of 55804 and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.250
a destination port of 80. When the Udacity server responds,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.640
it will send back a packet whose destination port matches

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.610
the one that we sent. That way, the OS will know

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.710
to route the packet to Chrome, and not to some

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.940
other program. It is important to realize that the transport

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.290
layer is really only active at the end points at

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.350
the route. The intermediate routers on the internet need only look

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.890
at the IP address to know where to forward the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.560
packet to. So they never examine the port number. Control starts

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.100
at the Application layer, moves through the Transport layer and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.400
the Network layer and the Link layer and the Physical layer.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.730
At the first node. Then through these intermediate steps, of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.570
course, we need to interpret the signal. Pull off any sort

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.680
of ethernet frame, or the like. And then look at the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.690
IP packet to figure out where the packet should go next.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.920
We never need to look inside the IP packet at whatever comes in the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.310
transport layer. And then forward it and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.570
the same thing happens in the next node,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.620
and then only when we receive it do we need to. Unpack the transport

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.140
layer. Route it to the correct application,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.030
and then let the application interpret the data.
