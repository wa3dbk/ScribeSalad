00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.108
So, let's do the solution to our BTB &amp;

00:00:03.108 --> 00:00:06.430
BHT quiz. We have a BHT with 16 entries which

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.350
gives perfect predictions. We have a BTB with four

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.310
entries, gives us perfect predictions. The question was, how many

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.680
times do we access the BHT for each of

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.120
these instructions? We access the BHT in order to tell

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.580
us whether this instruction is a taken branch. We

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.280
do that every time we fetch an instruction. And because

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.090
we have a perfect prediction for both BHT and the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.940
BTB that means that we will never fetch any instruction

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.330
that actually is not supposed to execute. So we now

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.790
just need to figure out how many times each of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.860
these instructions execute. This instruction here initalizes R2 to 100

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.360
and that instructions executes only one time once we have

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.050
done executing it we will go into the loop, loop

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.620
here and then exit never coming back here. Same here.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.150
This puts zero in R1. That executes only once. Now we have a loop. This loop

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.160
will execute as long as R1 and R2 are different. R1 initially has a zero

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.099
value, goes through here gets incremented, and then

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.470
we branch back. Now we execute this loop

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.969
once more, with R1 being equal to 1, and then 2, 3, et cetera. The last

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:22.662
iteration we do will be with R1 equal 99, and finally R1 will be incremented,

00:01:22.662 --> 00:01:28.524
we jump back here. FInd out that R1 and R2 are now the same, because

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:33.250
RI is now 100 and exit the loop. So, there is 100 iterations of this

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.940
loop, and each of these instructions does

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.990
executes 100 times. This instruction here executes 100

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.480
times when we're staying in the loop, and once we, for the 100th time

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.690
jump back, it executes once more in order to exit the loop. So this instruction

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.060
executes for 101 times, and each time

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.980
any of these instructions execute, we're gong

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.350
to access the BHT to see whether those instruction is in taken branch or not.
