00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.194
So we've discussed interim memory, working memory and long-term memory, such as

00:00:04.194 --> 00:00:08.718
episodic or semantic memory. But how do we get information to our long-term

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:13.521
memory? Well, there are four steps to long-term memory formation. There's

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:19.092
encoding, consolidation, storage and retrieval. Let's first start by looking at

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:22.943
encoding. So the first out of the four steps of turning information into

00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:27.782
long-term memory, as we said, is encoding. This means that we attend to new

00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:32.136
information, we take it in, and then we process the new information. So, our

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:37.010
brain focuses on something new, takes it in, and we process that information.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.540
That is us encoding new information. Now the key here is attend. It's important

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.619
to remember that we have to pay attention. Attention is what drives the process

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.926
of encoding. That is we have to pay attention to and be aware of the

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:54.138
information that we are trying to remember. Now, there are two types of

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:59.448
encoding. One type of encoding is termed automatic processing. As the name

00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:02.828
implies, it refers to encoding information that occurs with little effort or

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:07.343
conscious attention to the task. Remember, at the beginning of the lesson, when

00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:11.487
we asked if you remembered what you had for breakfast. This is an example of

00:01:11.487 --> 00:01:16.120
the kind of automatic processing we're talking about. So although you may have

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.207
encoded what you had for breakfast this morning, by the evening you may have

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:23.840
forgotten it. Because it took little effort or conscious attention to the task

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.030
the second type of encoding for long term memory is termed, effortful

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.933
processing. Effortful processing happens when we carefully pay attention to

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:36.549
information and try to make a conscious effort to remember the information. For

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.994
example, the type of symantic memories we have, such as remembering the names

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:44.566
of the presidents of the United States. Or trying to remember the names of all

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.468
the continents. These involve our ability to consciously pay attention to

00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:52.794
information and to put an effort into retaining this information. While you

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:56.572
take notes for this class. Or watch our videos, you're engaging in effortful

00:01:56.572 --> 00:02:01.100
processing because you're trying to retain the information that you've learned.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.847
At least I hope so. So, how do we go about engaging in effortful processing?

00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:09.627
Psychologists theorize levels of processing relate to our ability to more

00:02:09.627 --> 00:02:14.568
deeply encode information so that our recall improves. Let's go into a little

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.029
more detail about this.
