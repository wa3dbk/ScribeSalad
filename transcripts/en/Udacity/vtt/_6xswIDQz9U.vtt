In this part of the course, we will use two notations, mathematical logic and

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.210
OCL. The brand of mathematical logic we will use is called by various names,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.120
including first order logic, FOL, and predicate calculus. You should be familiar

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.100
with FOL from your undergraduate computer science courses. If you need a brush

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.810
up, there's a paper on the class resources page you can look at. Also for

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.600
purposes of this lesson, we will use a textual syntax for FOL that is described

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.830
on another paper on the class resources page. As a reminder, FOL enables you to

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.320
precisely express propositions, combine them using logical connectives like and,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.030
or, or not. And quantify them using the operators for all and there exists.
