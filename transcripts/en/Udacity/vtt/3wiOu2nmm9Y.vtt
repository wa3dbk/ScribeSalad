00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.738
This one would be d. For a negative exponent we take the reciprocal of the base

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:09.386
and raise it to a positive power. We know 1 divided by y cubed is the same as 1

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:14.568
divided by y cubed. Next, we multiply our numerators and denominators together

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:19.302
to get 7x squared divided by y cubed. This choice. To get to the answer more

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:24.323
quickly, think about what a negative exponent does. It moves the base from the

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:27.283
numerator to the denominator, just like in d.
