You're still here, fantastic.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.170
I know you want to get to the juicy
bits, but I need to bother your once

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.240
again with a bunch of general advice,
so you don't shoot yourself in the foot.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.970
Not all tools are created equal, and

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.560
like you learned in the quiz,
not all optimizations are worth doing.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.310
Let's go through a few common
scenarios that set you up for failure.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.610
Chances are you probably can't.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.060
And even if you can,
it won't be worth it.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.950
To give you a web dev example, hundreds
of engineering years went into tiny js

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.260
libraries like jQuery,
including some of my time actually.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.340
And yet, countless developers have
tried to replicate it with a 90%

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.608
similar feature set,
only to fail hard, again and again.

00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:40.837
Even popular clones like Zepto, couldn't
keep up when they realized that jQuery

00:00:40.837 --> 00:00:44.080
fixed a lot more cross-browser
maintenance than people thought.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.250
Even in modern browsers.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.930
Now we're talking idealistic
versus pragmatic.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.740
Yes, that 20% speed
increase will be ideal.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.070
But sticking to a tool that is
well supported by the community,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.690
is pragmatic.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.780
Gulp might be a little slower
than someone else's new tool.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.900
But you'll find answers for your
questions on stack overflow, plugins for

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.840
virtually anything and

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.860
can rest assured, that the tool is
going to be maintained by its creators.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.280
Don't just trust your instincts, but

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.040
consider the long-term value for
your project.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.560
So, it's neatly contained.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.380
All in package, huh?

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.760
Well, be careful with those.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.743
If a tool promises to do it all, and
stays away from offering any sort of

00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:23.979
connection points, say,
in API or modules, run.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.890
No, seriously.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.050
Life is too short to buy into
an ecosystem that you can't escape from,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.910
especially if the success
of your site depends on it.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.359
And finally, you should be careful with
any micro optimizations that are just

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.874
not worth it.

00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:41.162
If you are doing an optimization of your
work flow that takes, say four hours,

00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:44.682
and cuts a second away from a task
you perform once during the day,

00:01:44.682 --> 00:01:48.670
you need to do it for
40 years to justify the investment.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.870
And in 40 years, you could be sitting
in an intergalactic flying car,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.720
exploring the outer
realms of space instead.
