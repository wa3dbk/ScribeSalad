00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.910
It turns out that we also need a component that's going to supply us the text.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.630
Now, this isn't strictly in the GUI toolkit. But

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.030
in order to make this thing work, we have to access the text somehow. So we'll

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.980
call that the file manager component. We're going to make some assumptions.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.990
We're going to assume that you cannot hold the entire files contents in memory.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.310
You're going to have to go to the disk to get it. And assuming you have at

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.492
the operating level line oriented access to the file. So in your,

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:36.308
in your system libraries you have a way of, of reading the lines at anytime.

00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:39.950
So you're going to need to have a module, that when requested can

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.200
retrieve a limited length, consecutive sequence of the file's lines.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.670
And we're also going to assume we don't have to worry about opening the file or

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.760
closing the file. Just the reading of the file, supplying the lines.
