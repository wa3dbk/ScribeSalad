Whenever we want to find
some information in

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.790
our database using SQLAlchemy,
we use the query command followed by

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.610
the name of the table that
we want to search through.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.040
Using this enhanced for loop,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.318
we declared employee as the variable
that we're going to iterate through.

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:16.720
So, printing employee.name will print
out the name of every employee in

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.240
our database.
