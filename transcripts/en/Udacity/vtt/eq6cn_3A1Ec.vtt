00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.560
Welcome to Udacity's Full Stack
Web Developer Nanodegree.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.400
My name is Michael Wales, I've been
lucky enough to be a professional web

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.490
developer for over 16 years.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.940
It's a job that I love and
I'm passionate about.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.220
I joined Udacity to help people like you
launch themselves into a career that is

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.610
fun, exciting and
in a field that is endlessly growing.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.540
By completing Udacity's full
stack web developer nanodegree,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.750
you will have the qualifications you
need to start or advance your career as

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.260
a professional web developer with
the portfolio of projects to prove it.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.310
For example, you'll build a movie
website to share your favorite movie

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.730
trailers with your friends.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.850
You'll build a database driven
application to store and

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.740
analyze the results of a tournament.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.580
You'll build an item catalog website
that includes authentication and

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.840
allows users to update the content.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.990
You'll build a massively scalable
API that powers a mobile conference

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.950
application.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.330
And finally, you'll turn a bear
bones Linux server into a secure and

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.210
efficient web server
your applications demand.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.670
&gt;&gt; With the help of
our industry partners,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.840
we designed these projects
to showcase the skills and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.210
technologies companies are looking for
when hiring full stock web developers.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.690
Our team here at Udacity is excited to
help you develop the expertise you need

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.300
to build these projects.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.200
Before you get started, we'll help you
figure out if this nanodegree is a good

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.950
fit for you right now.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.150
Then once you're in the program, you'll
be supported by your student community

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.450
and by Udacity's coaches and
instructors.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.540
We'll be here to deepen your learning,
offer project feedback, and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.530
help you develop professionally.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.070
We look forward to
working with you soon and

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.140
we can't wait to see where
your nanodegree takes you.
