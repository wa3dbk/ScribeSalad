00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.250
Privacy actually is not a new problem.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.580
We have had it forever.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.020
Now people have always worried
about what others know.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.940
Others could be your friends,
could be your family,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.740
could be your adversaries,
your competition.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.860
It could be government agencies
when we talk about Big Brother,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.900
when we talk about the government.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.730
So what do they know about us,
in particular our activities and

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.000
what we do, or who we are?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.580
So we always have worried about this.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.520
So what's new in the online context?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.440
Well the scale and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.380
magnitude at which information about
what we do can be collected, okay?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.970
Our activities online and someone's
ability to collect information about

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.740
what we do, and
then be able to share it and use it, and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.150
even sold, sold for and
monetize that information.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.525
The scale at which this can
be done now is unprecedented.
