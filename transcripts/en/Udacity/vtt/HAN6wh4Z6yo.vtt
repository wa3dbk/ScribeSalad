00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.864
So, the last stage of life is of course death. Now, it's sobering to think

00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:06.600
about, but we're all going to to die and we all know we're going to die.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.190
Different people respond to death in different ways. These differences are best

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.240
seen in cases where people know that they're going to die in advance and have

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.057
time to prepare for it. For example, someone with a terminal illness. The

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:24.128
psychologist Elisabeth K端bler-Ross developed the most widely known and applied

00:00:24.128 --> 00:00:29.120
psychological model of people's response to death. People go through

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.207
predictable stages with their own death. Most people go through all of these

00:00:33.207 --> 00:00:37.782
stages, but some stages may be more intense than others. The five stages are

00:00:37.782 --> 00:00:42.200
denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
