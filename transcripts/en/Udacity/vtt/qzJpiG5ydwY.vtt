00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.291
Now that we found that 1/2 is a zero, we can say that x minus 1/2 is a factor

00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:09.115
of this polynomial. But really, we want our factors to have integer

00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:13.196
coefficients. And negative 1/2 is not an integer. I wonder if there's a way we

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:16.912
could rewrite this, so that this factor gives us the same zero. But it does

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:21.540
have integer coefficients. So what factor then gives us the same route as X

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.965
minus 1/2 does but as integer coefficients and is still a factor of F of X

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:33.700
equals 4X squared minus 4X plus 1. Please fill in the integers in these boxes.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.606
One more little tidbit for you to think about; When we had a route of X equals

00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:42.530
5 over 3 the factor that corresponded to it was 3X minus 5.
