I think we should change it. So, why? Why do I think we should change it? Well,

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:08.490
if we look at the inequality we have right now, and we plot it on a number line,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.618
we get this. We have a square bracket at 15, and all of the numbers to the left

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:16.894
of 15 on the number line are shaded. But notice that this includes numbers that

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:20.797
are less than zero, negative numbers. And it doesn't really make sense,

00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:24.762
considering number of staff that has to do with people, to have a negative

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:26.071
number of people hired.
