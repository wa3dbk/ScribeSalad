00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.283
Okay. We've got our basic if statement, if n

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:06.112
equals 1 in Python, we print the string n equals

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:11.780
1. Else, n does not equal 1. Now notice anything

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.660
I put between these curly braces, this could be HTML,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.059
this can be anything. This is just text. And

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.110
then finally, we finish this with end if. Notice there's

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.820
no space between end and if, that's all one word.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.620
So when we go to our browser to run this,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.860
and we reload the page, we see n does not

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.530
equal 1. Well that makes sense because we haven't specified n

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.010
in the URL. Now, I hope you're following along with

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.830
me, and let's go ahead and add n as a Get

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.370
parameter, and we'll make it equal to 1. Okay, so

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.870
we set n equals 1 in the URL here, and when

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.595
I hit Enter, hm, I expected this to say n equals

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:50.600
1. I wonder what happened. Maybe you can figure it out.
