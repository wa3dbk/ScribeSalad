00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:00.960
Okay.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.750
So what I'm thinking here
looking our possible inputs.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.200
If we were to take none or
an empty matrix as an input.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.490
We would return zero.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.280
Because for sure there would
be no islands in this case.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.990
But we could also have this as an input.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.639
So what I'm thinking here,
is we start at the first element.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.670
That's a one.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.120
So, I'll probably want some sort
of island counter variable and

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.960
I'll initialize that there and
increment it by one.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.590
And then I get to the zero.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.875
And that's not part of any islands.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:32.270
So, I don't need to
do anything there and

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.990
I get to this next element right here.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.600
So, that's actually part
of the same island.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.180
So I need to keep track of what
ones are part of the same island.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.100
Maybe what I could do is I could
look at the elements on top, and

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.300
on bottom, and then check if
they're part of the same island.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.446
And then keep track of it somehow.

00:00:57.446 --> 00:01:02.400
Yeah that sthird approach but if you're
looking at that first element for

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.350
example there is another one below
it but there's nothing above it.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.000
So what would you do in that case??

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.800
&gt;&gt; All right because since there
is not a one above that we'd

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.929
probably get some sort of runtime error.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.670
So first I would want to make sure
to check that there's actually

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.737
an element there before I
check if it's a one or a zero.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.625
So I'm going to need to
keep track of this somehow.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:27.670
Maybe this is some
sort of data structure.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, does this approach or
the problem or

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.940
anything you've been walking through
your remind you of anything?

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, since this matrix can sort
of be like represented as a graph.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.900
This might be a breath
first search problem.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.240
So what I could do is when
I find the first one,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.160
I can look at the elements around it and
I can add those elements to Q.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.390
Check if those are ones and then if
they're are ones I could set them to

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.700
another number so
they're marked as visited.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.169
And then I could keep going.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah that sounds really great.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.370
&gt;&gt; So it looks like his test cases
came in handy when brainstorming

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.370
his solution.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.200
&gt;&gt; Sure did.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.360
&gt;&gt; He was able to use test cases to inch
his way towards developing a solution.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.340
Something else I noticed was that
he had great communication with

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.670
the interviewer.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.859
He took the interviewer's cues to guide
him towards the correct solution.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.369
&gt;&gt; Yeah a big misconception that future
interviewees can have is they think that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.900
their interviewer isn't on their side.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.390
But really the interviewer
is there to help you and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.799
being able to take in their feedback
demonstrates your teamwork skills.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.420
Not to mention it helps
you solve the problem.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.109
Sometimes in an interviewee might get so
nervous that he or

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.720
she just completely ignores
the interviewer's suggestions.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.370
This can be a big turn off for
the interviewers.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.170
So what if the interviewee was still
stuck after looking at his test cases

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.140
and edge cases?

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.490
&gt;&gt; Well, one thing the interviewee
mentioned was that this problem reminded

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.510
him of the breath for
a search algorithm.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.739
Often if an interviewees is stuck
on a certain portion of the problem

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.210
they can begin to brainstorm
algorithms and data structures.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.240
The interviewee may have noticed that a
graph can be represented as a matrix and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.690
that a breath first search
algorithm would fit here.
