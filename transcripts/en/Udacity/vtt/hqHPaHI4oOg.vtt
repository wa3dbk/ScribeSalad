00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.658
The solution is something that we've seen in the previous examples. In order to

00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:07.879
update the move_dir vector, we query the state of the move-up, move-down, left,

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.530
and right actions. And adjust the movement vector accordingly. Once this is

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.700
done, we can test whether or not the length of the vector is equal to 0 or not.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.025
This gives us the ability to determine if the user's even pressed a key. If the

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:25.656
user hasn't pressed a key. Then the length of mov_dir will actually be 0. We

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:29.352
can test this with the LengthSquared function. It allows us to then only call

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:34.142
normalize or multiply when a user has pressed a movement key. And of course all

00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:36.937
of this data after being computed gets funneled into setLinearVelocity so we

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:41.085
can move our fancy awesome robot into the future. Now that we have the ability

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:44.495
to move the player around the world using keys The next step is to figure out

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:49.649
how they actually fire their fancy missiles towards the other robots.
