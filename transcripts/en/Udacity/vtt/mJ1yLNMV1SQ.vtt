00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
And the exact analysis of this algorithm here reveals that if the Boolean formula

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.480
has a satisfying assignment, then this assignment is found where the probability of about

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.470
3/4^n times some polynomial of n and I'll just write that as p(n) here.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.240
So how many times do you have to run this algorithm given the success probability here

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.490
to find the satisfying assignment on average, assuming there exist one.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.200
Now, if you have had a basic statistics course, you should already know

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.230
that the expected running time, so how often we have to run this algorithm until we find

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.790
a satisfying assignment assuming the Boolean formula has one is the time

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.270
for a single run divided by the success probability of one run.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.560
And of course, I'm going to let you figure our the final answer for this as our next quiz.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:53.060
So is the expected running time O(3/4^n times the polynomial of n) which is this polynomial here

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.090
times some other polynomial, which will represent the time for one run of this algorithm here

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.740
or is it O(4/3^n times the polynomial of n) times the time required for this algorithm here,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:14.240
or is it O(3/4^n times the polynomial for this algorithm here) divided by this polynomial here,

00:01:14.240 --> 99:59:59.000
or finally, is it O(4/3^n times the time required to run this algorithm here) divided by this polynomial.
