00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.747
So now we have this awesome more detailed
equation, but I still don't see any

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.864
numbers. What do we know about numbers in
this situation? Well we learned from our

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:14.630
story that Grant earned $3 million in
venture capital funding. So that means

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:19.772
that money from funders right here is well
equal to $3 million. So that means we can

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:24.847
write down that money from funders is
equal to $3 million. We also learned

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.376
something else about numbers. We heard
that every month, Grant spends a certain

00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:33.533
amount of money and in fact that money is
equal to $100,000. Like we've been talking

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:38.013
about for the past few minutes, any time
you have two things on either side of an

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:42.649
equal sign, you can substitute them from
another in other equations. So let's see

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:47.169
if you can figure out another way to write an equation
for the amount of money that Grant has

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:53.160
left. This time using these new numbers.
So down here I'd like you to fill in which

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.294
numbers belong in these two spaces that I
have given you. Now you don't need to

00:00:57.294 --> 00:01:00.537
write dollar signs because I already
filled them in for you. So we're just

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.941
taking all of this information up at the
top and combining it into one equation.
