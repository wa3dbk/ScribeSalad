00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.749
The first answer doesn't solve anything. It's just saying to do what we already

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:07.753
pretty much do. Shade the surface only if it points towards the light. The

00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:12.088
second answer works. You can use a slightly different vertex shader to render an

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:16.238
objects geometry a second time, reversing the normal before using it. The third

00:00:16.238 --> 00:00:20.385
answer doesn't work because culling is off. If you render two meshes in exactly

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:25.080
the same location, you will get z fighting. If culling was turned on in the data

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.490
set properly, this solution would work. Well, this solution doubles the size of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.230
the geometry need to store. It does have the advantage of not needing any

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.806
special treatment. It's just another object to render in the normal way. The

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:41.275
fourth answer will make almost all surfaces get some light. This fix will have

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:44.874
the effect of properly making the dark inside of the object be lit. However,

00:00:44.874 --> 00:00:48.778
there are also areas inside that are lit that shouldn't be, and these will

00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:53.339
continue to be lit. Similarly, the outside of the object would now be lit in

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.323
both sides, which gets too much light, so this answer is wrong.
