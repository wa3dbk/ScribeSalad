There's only one that's true here, and that's that the song seems to have had an

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:09.659
effect on engagement, but not learning. Think of it this way. Let's assume that

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:15.084
the song had no effect. Let's say we picked a random sample of size 20 from the

00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:20.820
population of learning scores. It's quite possible. You calculated about an 18%

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.703
chance to randomly select a sample with a mean learning score of 8.35. This is a

00:00:26.703 --> 00:00:31.408
pretty high probability. However, again, let's assume that the song had no

00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:35.341
effect and we picked a random sample of size 20 from the population of

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:41.567
engagement scores. We get that the mean engagement score is way out here, with a

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:46.093
z score of over 10. That's not likely to happen if we pick a random sample.

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:51.402
Therefore, there's evidence to suggest that the song had an effect on engagement

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:56.396
but not learning. However, we still can't be totally sure that the song caused

00:00:56.396 --> 00:01:01.716
higher engagement without setting up a proper experiment and implementing proper

00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:04.063
control conditions. Great job.
