00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.580
So, so far, we've seen two different types of domain restrictions. Some of them

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.075
are motivated by common sense, problem solving and real world quantities. So for

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:13.491
example as we saw earlier, Athena needs to design Grant's fun room so that the

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:18.304
dimensions are greater than zero. The other type is domain restrictions that are

00:00:18.304 --> 00:00:22.942
motivated by math. So restrictions that we need to impose in order to get only

00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:27.234
real or properly defined solutions. So an example of this would be avoiding

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:29.763
taking square roots of negative numbers.
