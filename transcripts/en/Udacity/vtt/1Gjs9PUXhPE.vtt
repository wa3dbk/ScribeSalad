00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.903
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well for one possibility 2 d plus one can be at negative 7, or equal to

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:07.949
negative 7, and for the other case 2 d plus one can equal positive 7. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:12.106
might have thought about this in your head, or maybe you did some equation

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:16.276
solving. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; We can subtract 1 from both sides to get 2 d is equal to negative 8

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:21.005
then divide both sides by 2, &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So d would equal negative 4. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; For this

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:26.621
equation, we subtract 1 from both side to get 2d equals 6, then we divide both

00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:31.952
sides by 2, so d would equal 3. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I think about plugging 3 in for d, I get 6

00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:36.937
plus 1 which is 7. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And if I think about plugging in negative 4 in for d, I

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:41.410
would get negative 8 ... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Plus 1, which is negative 7. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; So there are two

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.458
possible values of d that make this equation true.
