00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.812
The first choice is true. Objects definitely get dimmer the further they are

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:06.982
from a light source. The number of photons hitting a surface drops off

00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:10.403
proportional to the square of the distance from the light. The second choice is

00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:13.480
false. There's no reason that objects wouldn't have colors. Well, maybe if all

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.908
the objects in the closet were gray, but that's not a fair assumption. The third

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:21.604
choice is also false. Even though you're at the light source's location, the

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:25.222
objects can receive different amounts of photons, depending on their distance

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:29.162
from and angle to the light. The fourth choice is true. This is the main point

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:34.055
of this question. What the light sees, by definition, is not in shadow. We'll

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:37.243
use this fact later in the course to generate shadows on objects.
