00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.510
Student Rodith asks, "How do we go about finding a good seed page?"

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.000
&gt;&gt;This is a really good question,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.040
we haven't solved that question in this course, and we won't.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.000
We're going to give you a seed page and have exercises and--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.320
sets of pages to crawl set up so that seed page will work well.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.620
For a real web crawler, this is a big challenge.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.590
And they don't start with just one seed page;

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.990
they start with a set of many seed pages that are selected in different ways.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.750
Some may be found by hand,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.000
by people identifying them as good seed pages,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
some may be the results of previous crawls,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.700
so once you start crawling the web, you don't just stop--

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.670
you keep crawling the web and you build a new collection of pages,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.270
which you can start using start using as seed pages.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.000
But this is a hard problem--to get a good collection of seed pages--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to cover as much content as you can find on the web.
