Feel free to play around with the other data from that pole, maybe you'll find

00:00:03.598 --> 00:00:07.030
a correlation between the number of eggs in your refrigerator and the number of

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.036
icons on your desktop. Some of them have missing data, so you'll have to adjust

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:17.290
for that. Out of these two that we analyzed in the lesson, we saw that only one

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.982
of them was significant, age and number of pets. We can see then that as people

00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:28.240
age they tend to have more pets, that's kind of interesting right? But we can't

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.894
say for certain that the older you are more on time you arrive for a party, our

00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:38.400
P value was too high. Let's focus on this one that's significant. Let's say we

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.356
add an outlier to the data, like 20 and eight. A 20 year old who has eight

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:49.613
pets. How do you think this will change the correlation coefficient? Go ahead

00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:53.153
and add this data point to the spreadsheet, and find the new correlation

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.810
coefficient.
