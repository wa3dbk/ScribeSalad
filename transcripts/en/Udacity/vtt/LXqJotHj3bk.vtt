This means that x can be any real number to the right of 50 on the number line,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.106
since these are the numbers that are greater than 50. But this range doesn't

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:12.358
include 50. So we need to pick the parentheses that doesn't show inclusion; this

00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:12.958
round one.
