00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.282
The first thing we need to do is just distribute this negative sign to both

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:09.002
terms in the numerator of our second fraction. Then since these fractions have

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:13.352
the same denominator, we can write them as a single fraction. If 18 minus x

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:17.607
minus 15x plus 30, then we combine like terms. That gives us a rational

00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:22.199
expression of negative 16x plus 48 over 3x minus 6. And of course this is still

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.357
set as less than 0, since we haven't done anything to change both sides of the

00:00:26.357 --> 00:00:29.470
equation yet, that would affect the sign in the middle.
