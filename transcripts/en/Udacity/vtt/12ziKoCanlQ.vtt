00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.590
With images like photos, the total
file size depends on the number

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.990
of pixels multiplied by the number of
bits it takes to store each pixel.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.820
So, to improve performance, you need
to keep images as small as possible and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.890
compression as high as possible.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.070
It's a common mistake to save images
with dimensions too large, and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.270
quality too high.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.320
It might sound counter-intuitive,
but the first rule for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.299
saving images to a range of
devices is to save images

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.200
with the lowest possible quality,
and the smallest size as possible.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.120
But, how do you reduce file
size while maintaining quality?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.010
Throughout this course,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.150
you'll learn how to use responsive
techniques to do just that.
