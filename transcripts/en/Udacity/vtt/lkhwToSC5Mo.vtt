00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.790
Okay, so I've got the website open.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.400
Let's go ahead and

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.950
try it out in dev tools, I'll open it up by pressing Cmd+Option+I and

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.700
let's go ahead and just select one of these rows.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.150
Sure, row and here we go.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.570
Now I'm going to answer this a little bit out of order.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.230
We should see changes immediately.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.980
As soon as we start typing in here.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.960
So display and the first one was block.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.620
Press Enter and it looks like nothing happened up here.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.950
Okay, so I'm not feeling too good about block.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.800
Let's try float.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.100
We'll just go ahead and jump to that.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.590
Go to F-L-O-A-T and press Enter.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.980
Oh, okay so that's being invalidated by something.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.650
Okay. So that's not working.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.940
Let's try instead, display flex.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.600
Hey, hey.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.070
And look at that.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.230
As soon as we do it, our columns look right.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.720
2 and 10 are lined up.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.940
3 and 9 are lined up.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.930
4, 4, 4.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.110
They're acting like we expected them to.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.600
And of course, we can also add flex wrap, wrap.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.400
And it still looks good.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.720
To learn more about flex and

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.290
the way it works, check out the link in the instructor notes.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.360
This means that display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap, is the correct answer.
