Okay. Are you ready for the answer, here it goes. So, you have 1, 2, 3, 4

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:08.532
lines, and I didn't pick up my pen. This task is important because it

00:00:08.532 --> 00:00:13.521
demonstrates a very important principle of creative thinking. You have to break

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:17.486
out of your mental perceptual limits, these limits you might not even realize

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:22.419
you have. We were going to discuss a little bit more when we talk about problem

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.276
solving. But here, if you struggled with this, you probably didn't realize you

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:32.351
impose a square on the nine dots, like this. A lot of people who struggle with

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:36.958
this try to stay within the box. This is a very literal example of thinking

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:41.508
outside of the box. If you think about things differently, from a different

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:46.673
perspective, you may come up with a creative solution. Breaking outside of your

00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:50.918
self-imposed mental limits. Highly creative people do this intuitively,

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:55.030
automatically. For more problems like this and to demonstrate how creative

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.336
thinking can be assessed, go to the website we put in the instructor's

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:00.189
comments.
