00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here we are again, we have a mystery test function and what is it actually in here that causes the input?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What is it that causes mystery test to fail? Well, we can again use delta debugging to figure this out.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These are implementation of delta debugging.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm going to extend this such that the test now comes as a parameter.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And then, we can invert ddmin with an appropriate test just as we'd like.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And I'm going to invert the ddmin with this input for which you already know

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that it causes mystery test to fail and then passing mystery test as a parameter.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's see what's in here that causes mystery test to fail.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Press 1, we press 1 and we see a single character, a single dot suffices.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
A single dot suffices to cause mystery test to fail. So what we have here is classical set.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
First, we use a fuzz tester to test a program and then we repeat

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and repeat this until the program breaks.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then we feed this into delta debugging which again runs the program again and again

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
until we get a minimal failing input such as a single dot.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Such minimal failing inputs are very important as it comes to convincing other people to fix a bug.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Suppose your program for testing is a huge SQL server.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Suppose you use a first tester to generate extremely long

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and complex SQL query that you sent to the SQL server.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And then, the SQL server is going to choke on one of these super, super complex inputs

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and then you say to the SQL developers, "Hey, I have this very, very long and complicated

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
SQL query and I can use this to break the server," but the developers are going to tell you,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
"Ha, a big query like this one, never ever happens in practice".

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So maybe this will crash our server but it's really not the top priority right now.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We'd rather care about real queries, thank you very much.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So what you'd do then is you run this big, big complicated query to delta debugging

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
which then will give you some minimal failing input.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
which now will be way, way smaller and actually look

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
like something so simple that it can actually happen in practice.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And all of a sudden, the SQL developers will take you very seriously because all of a sudden

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
this looks like something that could happen in practice.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
True story from Microsoft.
