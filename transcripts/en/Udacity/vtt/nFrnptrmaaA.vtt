00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.280
Okay, here's my version. First thing we do is, we

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.473
call our make_salt function. We imported hashlib so we can

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:09.360
have SHA256. And so, first I create the hash, this

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.670
part of the response. SHA256 of name plus pw plus salt.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.770
Call hexdigest on that. And then I, we return that,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.630
and the salt separated with a comma. So let's give

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.860
this a whirl. We run this function and we see

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.465
we get this nice hash and we get our salt and

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:28.280
if I were to run this again, I should get a completely different hash and a

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.520
completely different salt. There we go. And I

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.540
can keep running this and keep getting different answers.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.350
So you can see the salt basically adds an extra

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.910
bit of randomness to, to what we're going to see in our

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.405
hash. And it prevents a, a would be attacker from

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:48.330
pre-computing all of the possible hashes. And it also prevent a

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.550
would be attacker from you know, of course seeing all

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.230
of our plain text passwords. So now we've got a reasonably

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.450
decent password hashing thing. There's a, we need to write

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.410
one last function in this. Let's go ahead and do that.
