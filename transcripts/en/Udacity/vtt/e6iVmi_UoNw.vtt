00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.144
Okay, now let's look at some code.

00:00:02.144 --> 00:00:04.709
It's going to take us 2 kernels to be able to run this.

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:07.501
The first one is going to be an initialization kernel that we run once,

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:11.780
and then we're going to show our iteration kernel that we're going to run on every iteration of the loop.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.722
Now the initialization kernel is extremely simple.

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:17.330
It's just a map over all the vertices,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.230
and it's simply going to initialize the vertex array.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.712
So we get the vertex array as an argument, we know how long it is,

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:26.695
and we know which vertex is the starting vertex.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:31.202
All we're going to do is calculate a global index for our particular thread,

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:36.319
and then if our thread is the starting vertex, then we're going to set its depth to 0.

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.759
Otherwise, we're going to set it to negative 1,

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:42.612
and here we're going to designate negative 1 as our not visited value.

00:00:42.612 --> 00:00:45.785
Okay. This is very simple. Easy map operation.

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:48.209
The more interesting one is the one we'll show next,

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:52.155
which is the kernel that we're going to run on every iteration.
