00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.450
Many science textbooks in middle school or

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.990
high school explain the atomic structure in terms of the solar system.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.050
Here's a representation for the solar system, here's a representation for

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.570
the atomic structure. Let us see how this model of the solar system helps us

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.890
make sense of the atomic structure. We'll use this example often going forward.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.910
And this representation of the solar system is arrows are denoting causality. So

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.710
the sun's mass is greater than the planet's mass,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.740
which causes the planet to revolve around the sun. Similarly for the atomic

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.740
structure, there is a force within the nucleus and the electron, and that causes

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.239
the nucleus to attract the electron and the electron to attract the nucleus.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.670
Given these two models, what are the deep similarities between them?
