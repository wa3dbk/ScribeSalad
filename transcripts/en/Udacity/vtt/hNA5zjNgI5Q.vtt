00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.837
So the quiz we just did shows that
adding more cores might result in a slow

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:08.121
down if we have to stay
within the same power budget.

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:12.798
But, this is only true if we cannot
adjust the voltage and frequency, so

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:17.249
that when there is no parallelism
available we boost the frequency of

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.740
the one or two active cores so that they
get the full power budget of the chip.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.030
Modern processors do this.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.900
Let's look at an example
of Intel's core I7-4702MQ.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.410
Which was released in
the second quarter of 2013.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.120
It's a mobile processor, so
it's design power is only 37 watts.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.210
That's what we can pull in a laptop,
apparently.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.820
It has four cores.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.730
And, it's normal clock when using
all four cores is 2.2 GHz maximum.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.413
It can actually save power because it
might operate on a battery by reducing

00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:58.547
this frequency even when
running all four cores.

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:07.680
But the processor has a turbo frequency
of 3.2 GHz when running only one core.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.620
That frequency is 1.45
times the normal frequency.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.610
If we assume that the power
increases cubically with this,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.590
then we will get three times the power.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.000
So we are not using four times
the power of a single core,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.510
which we should be able to
get because it's four cores.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.750
So when operating
one-quarter of the cores,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.600
that one-quarter of the cores
can get four times the power.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.770
We're only getting three times, so
the question is why not four times.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.260
Well, because it's not only
about the overall chip power.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.430
What's really happening is that if
we have a relatively large chip and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.930
we have four cores on it, let's say.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.490
And we keep heating up
this part of the chip,

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.170
the heat will spread into
other parts of the chip.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.780
But this one will still be
hotter than the others.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.926
So if we're spending power
evenly across the chip,

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:11.155
we can spend more power than if we
spent it all in one corner of the chip.

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:17.580
Because if we spread the power around,
then the chip overall gets hotter.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.870
If we spend all power in the same place,

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.320
then that place gets
a lot hotter than before.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.219
So that's why three times and
not four times.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:31.480
Because at three times the power this
part of the chip achieves similar

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.820
temperatures to those achieved by
spreading the heat around at 2.2 GHz.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.350
Let's look at another example
which is Intel's core I7-4771.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.330
It's a similar processor released
in third quarter of 2013.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.760
So they're relatively similar in
terms of technology and so on.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.330
But this is not a laptop processor,
its design power is much higher.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.270
84 watts.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.210
It's also has 4 cores.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.200
But the normal clock of
a core is now 3.5 GHz.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.250
Much larger than in
the mobile processor.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.766
The turbo clock,
when running only one core, is 3.9 GHz.

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:19.608
Or only 11% above normal.

00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:24.306
And if we assume that the power is
cubically growing with frequency,

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:29.004
that means it's only spending 1.38
times the power of a core when

00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:31.580
working with three other cores.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.240
Why is it like that?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.512
Well, because this being a normal bell
processor has much better cooling,

00:03:39.512 --> 00:03:44.228
so it can cool the chip when
operating at this high power.

00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:47.973
But that also means that the chip
is already pretty hot and

00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:52.267
getting it even slightly hotter
in any place very quickly reaches

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:56.030
the temperatures at which
it's dangerous for the chip.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.590
So we could only really spend
this much more power in one core

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.660
even though the others are not working.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.590
So pretty much what's happening is,
when running at

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.070
four cores the chip is very
close to not being able to cool.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.350
If we turbo boost a particular part
of the chip, it gets even hotter and

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.460
we can only afford a little bit more of
heat before we run into cooling issues.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.190
Even though the heat is kind of leaking
to the cooler parts of the chip it's

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.544
just not doing it enough.

00:04:28.544 --> 00:04:31.724
And this is pretty typical
that cores designed for

00:04:31.724 --> 00:04:35.520
lower power have more flexibility
in shifting that power.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.530
Whereas, if we are near
the limits of what we can do,

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.900
then really shifting the power so
that it can all be consumed in one

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.340
corner very quickly gets that one
corner of the chip to overheat.
