00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.394
This hypotenuse is the square root of 241. This square root would be about 15

00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:12.107
and a half. Great thinking if you got this exact answer. For this problem, we

00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:17.137
know the legs are 4 and 15, and the hypotenuse is x. It's unknown, since we

00:00:17.137 --> 00:00:22.839
don't know it. So we'll have 4 squared plus 15 squared equals x squared. We'll

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:29.253
square 4 to get 16 and we'll square 15 to get 225. Adding these two together,

00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:34.222
we'll get 241 equals X squared. We'll take the square root of both sides,

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:38.675
keeping only the positive root, since this is a distance; which gives us x

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:45.090
equals the square root of 241. Again, great work, if you got this correct.
