00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
So, I'll start out with a very simple graph here.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.300
Let's say in this graph you wanted to  get from A to B.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.640
I've purposefully not added any distances to the edges here,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.620
because we will just assume that the length of each edge is 1.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.770
Now, if you wanted to get from A to B,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.030
what would be the length of the shortest path from A to B

00:00:21.030 --> 99:59:59.000
that visits all vertices. Please enter your answer here.
