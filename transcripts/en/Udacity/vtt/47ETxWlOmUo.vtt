Now that we have a good understanding
of modern application design,

00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:06.171
I'm pretty sure our next
step is to deploy our code.

00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:08.528
Now I'm thinking about
application dependencies.

00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:10.528
I'm thinking about how
to build packets and

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:13.915
distribute all of these applications,
and this seems like a lot of work.

00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:16.181
Kelsey, is there any way around this?

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:19.520
&gt;&gt; One option would be figure
out all your dependencies and

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.496
build a native package for every
Linux distro you plan to support or

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:26.638
you can skip all of that and
build a container image.

00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:28.357
&gt;&gt; What's a container image?

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:31.308
&gt;&gt; A container image is a packaging
format that includes not

00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:34.076
only your application, but
all your dependencies or

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:37.110
runtime information required to run it.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.630
Think about your mobile phone.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.295
You download a self-contained
application and run it.

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.634
Containers do the same thing but
for your servers.

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:48.090
&gt;&gt; So this is something that's
available on servers today?

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.110
&gt;&gt; Close.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.890
The container technology is built
into most major operating systems,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.510
including Linux and Windows, but it's
not exactly easy to use out of the box.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.420
You'll need something like Docker
which provides a nice API on top of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.670
container technology and
makes it easy to create, distribute,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.950
and run container images
on your own servers.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.040
Okay, I get it.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.370
You know,
given the available options, and

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.090
my sanity, it seems like container
images are the way to go.
