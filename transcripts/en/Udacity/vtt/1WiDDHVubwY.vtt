00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.713
So this is an example of a really key principle in parallel programming

00:00:02.713 --> 00:00:05.885
and, indeed, in all of computer science.

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:08.393
We call that principle Amdahl's law.

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:11.968
The total speedup you get is limited by the portion of the time you spend

00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:14.428
doing something that can be parallelized.

00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:17.572
In the limit of enough parallelism, doing a good enough job with parallelism,

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:22.133
having a parallel enough machine, your maximum speedup goes to 1/1/P,

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:26.069
where P is defined as the percentage or portion of parallelizable time--

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.708
time spent on this parallelizable activity.

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:31.709
So it's really important that you know these limits.

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:35.681
So, for example, if your application spends 50% of its time on I/O,

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:40.753
reading and writing to the disk, that implies that you can't possibly do better than a 2x speedup,

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:44.621
unless, that is, you can come up with a way to refactor the computation.

00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:47.939
For example, maybe you can read and write larger batches of data at once

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:50.778
so that the GPU has more work to do on a single batch.

00:00:50.778 --> 00:00:54.921
And I want to say this situation comes up pretty often in practice, right?

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:58.422
GPUs are so fast that often porting the hotspot to CUDA

00:00:58.422 --> 00:01:01.860
makes that hotspot so much faster that it's no longer the bottleneck.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.911
And that's why I made the point earlier that if you have a bunch of functions,

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:10.815
you might need to do more than port a single hotspot to the GPU.

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:14.072
You might find that after you've ported that first hotspot to the GPU,

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:18.496
it's gotten so much faster that now you need to focus somewhere else.

00:01:18.496 --> 00:01:21.029
And remember, once you've crossed this point,

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:24.229
there's little point in continuing to optimize this.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.398
The total time on your application is not going to go down very much

00:01:27.398 --> 00:01:29.731
if you continue to work on this hotspot.

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:32.003
You need to shift your attention to the new bottlenecks.
