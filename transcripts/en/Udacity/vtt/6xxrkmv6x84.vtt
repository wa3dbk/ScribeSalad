00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.610
Let's now dive into some
characteristics of fonts a bit.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.870
Think of this as a crash
course on the anatomy of type,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.170
a super fast primer on basic typography.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.810
Now, as we mentioned earlier, Roboto
is a standard font included in Android.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.980
It is a Sans-serif font.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.210
Sans-serif means without serifs.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
Serifs are the little wings
attached to the strokes of a letter

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.970
like these here that
hang off the letter r.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.270
Serif fonts are common in
printed works like books and

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.950
are generally considered more
comfortable for long form reading.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.040
On the other hand, Sans-serif fonts
are more common on the web and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.480
can be well suited to short bursts
of texts like in user interfaces.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.690
There's also generally a safer choice
when you're dealing with a range of

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.320
screen densities.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.350
A Serif font can be a great compliment
with Roboto if used sparingly for

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.390
things like title headings and
large type.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.290
Now, due to issues like anti aliasing
which would make small Serifs appear

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.300
kind of blurry.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.180
It wouldn't be advisable to use a Serif
font for really, really small text.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.180
Let's also briefly talk
about font metrics.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.690
We're only going to talk about
the English alphabet for now.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.230
When trying to describe the anatomy of
text, you can easily go down a long,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.820
long, long rabbit hole.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
Anyway, let's first
start with the baseline.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.930
The baseline is essentially
the optical bottom point

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.800
of all text that doesn't extend below,
like the lowercase y here.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.860
Next is the x-height which refers to the
height of the lowercase x in the font.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.820
Basically the height of most lowercase
letters, like the letter e here.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.810
Fonts with the relatively large
x-height tend to be more legible and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.290
better suited for body text.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.450
After that is the cap height
which is the height of most

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.220
uppercase letters like
the capital T here.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.310
And next you have ascenders and
their cousin descenders.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.550
These are part of the lowercase letters
that extend way above the cap height or

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.380
below the baseline.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.730
So the h has an ascender here and
the y has a descender.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.250
And finally, you have the leading.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.750
That's the spacing between
vertical lines of text.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.860
On Android, you can control the leading
by providing a line spacing multiplier

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.780
or line spacing extra for a text view.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.040
Now, there's a lot more to
font anatomy than just this.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.180
Like I said, we just talked
about the English alphabet.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.270
