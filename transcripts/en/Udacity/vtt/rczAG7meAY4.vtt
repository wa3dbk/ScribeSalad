00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is this is the largest covariance. It's the widest spread.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is the smallest, and this is medium.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
To see how this is being found in the formula over here,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the difference between x and y is being normalized by the covariance.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The larger this value, the less the difference over here matters,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and, as a result, the more the function is spread out.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So functions with a very wide spread have the largest covariance,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
whereas functions with small spread have the smallest covariance.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Put differently, the sigma-squared covariance is a measure of uncertainty.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The larger sigma-squared, the more uncertain we are about the actual state.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is a very certain distribution where expected deviation is small.

00:00:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is a relative uncertain distribution where we know very little.
