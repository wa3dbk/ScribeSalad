00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.545
So, let me help you recall the last quiz first things first. Before we show that

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:09.090
if we had negative 3, the entire quantity taken the 4th power, that was equal to

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:13.749
positive 81. The difference between that question and this question here, is the

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:18.181
lack of parenthesis in this problem. This time we need to think about order of

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:22.187
operations. I'm not going to do a super in depth review of this here, but we're

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.772
going to give you plenty of review problems to practice it, and we'll also keep

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:29.233
touching on it at different points throughout the course, since it's pretty

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:32.818
fundamental to doing algebra or any other kind of math. You may have heard some

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.587
sort of mnemonic device or acronym earlier to help you remember The order that

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:41.096
we do different mathematical operations when we're evaluating expressions. So I,

00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:45.608
for example, learned PEMDAS. Now, each of these letters stands for a different

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.170
mathematical operator. The P, here, is for parentheses. The E, here, stands for

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:54.783
exponents. The M stands for multiplication. The D stands for division. The A is

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:58.970
for addition, and the last but not least, the S is for subtraction. So this can

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:03.198
serve as a guideline, to tell us what order we do all these different operations

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.318
in, when we're looking at some set of numbers and variables combined together

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.480
with these operators. So in the last question we did, for example, since the P

00:01:11.492 --> 00:01:15.741
for parentheses comes before the E for exponents, we knew that the negative sign

00:01:15.753 --> 00:01:20.065
needed to be applied to the three. Since it was inside the parethesis before,

00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:24.887
before we took that number to an exponent. There are no parenthesis written out

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.231
here. So we really have, when we have a negative sign in front of a number,

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:33.789
remeber is negative 1 times that number. So negative 3 is actually equal to

00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:38.483
negative 1 times 3. And we take this 3 to the 4th power. The 4 is only attached

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:43.123
to this 3 now because there are no parenthesis that surround the negative sign

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:47.829
as well. Since PEMDAS tells us that we evaluate exponenents before we multiply

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:52.412
we first need to figure out what 3 to 4t h equals before we can multiply that by

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:57.011
negative 1. So we know that 3 to the 4th is equal to 3 times itself 4 times. So

00:01:57.023 --> 00:02:01.541
now I will just multiply all this out and we get negative 81, so you can see

00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:06.404
that negative 3 to the 4th power gives us a completely different answer than the

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:11.131
whole quantity of negative 3 taking to the 4th power. Parenthesis make a huge

00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:15.944
difference from using exponents so I say please don't forget to take advantage

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:20.252
of review exercises we give you. You want to make sure that things like order of

00:02:20.264 --> 00:02:23.737
operations, that you've probably seen in previous courses, feel completely

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.421
comfortable for you. So, if you're having trouble at all with this, or just want

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.638
to make sure that you totally understand it, do a bunch of our practice

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.124
problems. This is going to help establish a really strong foundation for you as

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:35.499
we move forward in this course.
