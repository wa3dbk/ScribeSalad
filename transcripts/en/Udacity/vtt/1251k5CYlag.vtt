00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.237
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, I hope you can tell, that both point-slope form and slope-intercept form,

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:08.462
are super useful for us, depending on what information we start out with in our

00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:12.784
problem. What if we know that a line goes through 2 points, 7, 4 and 3, 9? Let's

00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:16.811
see if we can come up with an equation for this. Instead of doing this all in

00:00:16.811 --> 00:00:21.161
one step though, let's break it down. First things first, let's find the slope.

00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:23.436
Please fill in this box for the value of m.
