00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's a game I would like to play with you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I drew on the right side six different expressions, and I'm going to derive this for you,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
leaving out those six expressions and whenever I stop, you have to pick one on the right side,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Click the appropriate radio button--or maybe two of them--and if they're correct, we'll move on.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
To calculate the variance of x, we first notice that p is the mean of x,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and if you look at the two possible outcomes starting with heads and then tails,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
you find that the probability for heads is p and if heads is chosen

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
then the variance is the quadratic difference of the actual outcome,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which is 1 for heads minus the mean which equals p.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Complete the same expression for the tails case.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What's the probability of tails, and if tails actually occurs, the outcome is 0.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What will be the quadratic deviation we putt into this formula over here?
