So, let's now apply the idea of pipelining to

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.150
laundry and let's do a quiz on that. Let's

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.230
say we have a washer, a dryer and some

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.782
sort of a folder device for laundry. And let's say

00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:15.026
the washer takes 1 hour to process a load

00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:18.658
of laundry. The dryer takes 1 hour to process

00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:21.668
a load of laundry, and the folder takes 1

00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:25.472
hour to fold a load of laundry. Let's say you

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:28.307
have 10 loads of laundry that you want to

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:31.902
do. With no pipelining, how many hours does it

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:34.998
take to process these 10 loads of laundry through

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:39.050
this? And with pipelining, how many hours does it take?
