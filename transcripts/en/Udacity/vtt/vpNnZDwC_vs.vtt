00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.170
Another important distinction, when talking about requirements, is that

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.220
between user and system requirements. So, let's start with defining

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.540
user requirements. Those are requirements that are written for the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.400
customers and they're often in natural language and they don't

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.190
contain technical details. And the reason for that is

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.740
that their purpose is to allow customers, stakeholders, to check

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.210
that the system will do what they intended. So it's

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.470
a way for the analyst, the developers, to communicate with

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.460
the customers, with the stakeholders. System requirements, on the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.560
other hand, are written for developers. Contain detailed functional and

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.330
non functional requirements. Which we just discussed, and which

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.860
are clearly and more rigourously specified than the user requirements.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.130
And the reason for this difference is that the

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.410
purpose of the system requirements is to tell developers what

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.870
to build. They must contain enough details so the

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.480
developers can take them and use them to design and

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.530
then develop a system. Just to give you a concrete

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.750
example, here I'm showing you a user requirement that just says

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.510
that the software must provide a means of representing and accessing

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.940
external files created by other tools, and the corresponding system requirement.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.700
And as you can see, even if we don't read the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.380
whole requirements. The former is an informal and high level description

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.210
of a piece of functionality, whereas the latter describes the same

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.940
functionality but in a much more extensive and rigorous way. As

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.760
I said, this is something that the developers can use to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.820
design and then build a system whereas this is something that

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.590
can be used to communicate. With the stakeholders, with a non-technical

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.490
audience. And we need to define both because they serve different purposes.
