00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.642
Now, you might be wondering why on Earth this is helpful at all, well, remember,

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:07.264
what we're trying to do here. Since we can't factor this expression, we need a

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:10.877
different way to find the x-intercepts. Here, we can tell that we're getting

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:14.414
close to being able to do that. At some point, we want to set y equal to zero,

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:18.160
and now we only have x written in one spot in our equation, rather than in two.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.445
We know how to take square roots, so I feel like we're getting pretty close. At

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:26.640
this point, we need to think about the difference of squares again. Remember

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.798
that if we have a squared minus b squared, we can factor this as a minus b times

00:00:30.798 --> 00:00:34.878
a plus b. Here, we have one term that's clearly squared, so maybe we can use

00:00:34.878 --> 00:00:38.446
this technique to help us out. Now, 6 doesn't look like a squared number, but

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:41.735
that doesn't really matter. We can stil,l of course, take the square root of 6

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:45.021
and get a number. It may not be an integer but it is a real number. What I would

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:48.183
like you do now is keeping all that in mind, write out the two factors in this

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:51.758
form that we have coming from this expression right here. This is going to look

00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:56.110
pretty different from anything we worked with before and you may not think it

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.258
looks very pretty but just go with it, this is going to be super, super useful

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:02.190
in everything we have coming up.
