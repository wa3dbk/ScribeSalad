00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.680
As we mentioned when we introduced
closures, it's possible for

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.490
a function to take another
function as an argument.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.590
We call these higher order functions.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.110
In this session, we'll walk
through how to use some of Swift's

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.230
powerful higher order functions,
including map, filter, and sort.
