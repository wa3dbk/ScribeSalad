00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.260
Our last lesson covered
the basics of Turing machines.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.950
At the beginning of last lecture,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.830
I said that the Turing machine precisely
captures an ocean of computation.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.850
In this lecture we will give strong
evidence for this Church-Turing thesis,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.040
the statement that everything computable
is computable by a Turing machine.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
The Church-Turing thesis is named for
Alan Turing and Alonzo Church.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.380
Church had an alternative model of
computation known as the Lambda

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.830
calculus, which turns out to be exactly
as powerful as a Turing machine.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.420
We call the Church-Turing Thesis,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.740
a thesis because it isn't a statement
we could prove or disprove.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.350
In this lecture,
we'll give a strong argument

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.180
that our simple Turing machine can do
anything today's computers can do.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.480
Or anything a computer could
ever do in the future.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.640
&gt;&gt; To convince you of the Church-Turing
Thesis, I'll start from the basic Turing

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.710
machine and then branch out, showing
that it is equivalent to machines as

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.470
powerful as the most advanced machines
today, or in any conceivable future.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.534
We'll begin by looking at
multi-tape Turing machines,

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:02.104
which in many cases are much
easier to work with.

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:05.613
And we'll show that anything
a multi-tape Turing machine can do

00:01:05.613 --> 00:01:07.732
a regular Turing machine can do, too.

00:01:07.732 --> 00:01:10.170
Then we'll consider
the random access model.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.220
A model capturing all the important
capabilities of a modern computer.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.704
And we will show that it is equivalent
to a multi-tape Turing machine, and

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:21.620
therefore must also be equivalent
to a regular Turing machine.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.670
This means a simple Turing machine can
compute anything your Intel i7 can or

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.530
whatever chip you may happen
to have in your computer.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.260
Hopefully, by the end of the lesson
you'll have understood all these

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.020
connections and you'll be convinced that
the Church-Turing Thesis really is true.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.460
Formally, we can state it like this,
a language or a function for

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.780
that matter is computable, and
I've used quotes here to indicate

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.710
that we mean this in the common meaning
of the word, not in the technical sense.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.820
If and only if it can be decided,
or in the case of a function,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.590
computed, by a Turing machine.
