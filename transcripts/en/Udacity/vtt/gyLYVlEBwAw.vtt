So let's recap. Chemicals tell us when to eat and when to stop eating. We also

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.745
know that just because we're full of one food doesn't necessarily mean that

00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:11.287
we're full of all foods. For example, we might eat a piece of pie or have a

00:00:11.287 --> 00:00:15.902
bowl of ice cream after we're full from eating a cheeseburger. Now how we

00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:19.678
decide what we eat is really complicated and influenced by many things other

00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:23.830
than just hormones. So let's just take a closer look at that.
