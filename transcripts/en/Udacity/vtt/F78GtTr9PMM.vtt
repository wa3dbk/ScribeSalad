00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.800
Our fifth architectural style is implicit invocation.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.680
And here let's first examine the question of reliability.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.330
Well, if you're approached to event delivery,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.230
in an implicit invocation style it's centralized you are more easily able to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.270
deal with unexpected events, thereby improving reliability.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.100
On the other hand, because interactions are implicit, overall system

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.860
understandability is reduced, potentially compromising reliability.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.890
Or the other four system qualities, performance, might be

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.240
compromised because of the extra communication due to the bookkeeping and

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.005
indirection can lead to context swapping problems.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.510
Maintainability, there may be increased reuse due to the independents of

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.030
the components.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.460
On the other hand, as far as safety is concerned,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.464
increased interaction complexity may make it harder to ensure safety.

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:56.510
And with to respect security as we saw with object orientated,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.430
object orientation, the fragmentation of an implicit location architectural

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.950
style can cause problems, but encapsulation can help to mitigate them.
