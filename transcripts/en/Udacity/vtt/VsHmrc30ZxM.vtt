00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.750
So now we're going to touch on some material that we talked about during the

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.840
lesson on the brain which was lesson three. This material may feel pretty

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.740
dense, but you can always refer to the document we're giving you on the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.865
physiological side of the stress response. Stressful events can cause changes

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:20.121
in our physiology. Most importantly, we see that the autonomic nervous system,

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:24.147
endocrine system and the brain all interact together to produce changes in our

00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:30.487
body systems as a result of stress. Remember that the autonomic nervous system

00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:36.414
has both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Sympathetic is

00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:40.780
responsible for arousing and parasympathetic is responsible for calming.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.616
Remember, for example, when Susan encountered the bear in Yosemite? This

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:49.234
resulted in activation of her sympathetic nervous system, which allowed for an

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:52.798
increase in heart rate, which pumped more blood to the large muscle groups, and

00:00:52.798 --> 00:00:55.930
more oxygen was available so her muscles can function and react to the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.169
dangerous situation she found herself in. In addition to the autonomic system,

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:06.122
the endocrine system is important in our stress response because it consists of

00:01:06.122 --> 00:01:12.018
the major hormone-releasing glands that are active during our stress response.

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:16.710
That's the Pituitary gland and the Adrenal glands.
