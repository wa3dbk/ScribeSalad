00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.844
You've just run into the phenomenon called Overflow. Just like a glass of

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.358
orange soda can overflow when the foam goes wild, the same can happen with

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:17.001
integers. The largest integer that java can represent is this number over here.

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.649
don't worry about the exact number, but you do want to remember that it's about

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:25.836
2 billion. When a number gets larger than 2 billion in change then java can no

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:30.114
longer hold the value in an integer, and the most common remedy is to use the

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:36.134
double type. Give it a try. Here, one million is typed as a floating point

00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:41.050
number, as a double. Now multiply it by itself, and what do you get for

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.110
mystery?
