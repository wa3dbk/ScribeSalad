00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.570
What I've got plotted here and
sort of a notional plot,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.210
this is a loss, expected loss, right?

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.003
On the left hand side, that's the
probability that it's a four given an x

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.502
times the loss of that it's a four and
I call it a nine.

00:00:15.502 --> 00:00:19.577
Over here, this is the probability
that it's a nine, but

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:21.580
I actually called it a four.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.657
And the decision boundary is where
these values are equal to one another.

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:31.110
And of course, what is hard about this?

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.090
Well, knowing what the losses are,
that's easy, okay?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.685
You just tell me, right?

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:39.704
You tell me, how expensive is it for
me to call a smart person not so

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:42.776
smart versus calling a not so
smart person smart,

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:46.230
will probably have something
to do with their stature.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.241
Okay?

00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:51.900
So my losses might be asymmetric,
or my losses might be symmetric.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.520
Like, I'm doing zip codes, right?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.290
And if I call a four, a nine you know,
it goes to California and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.880
it should have gone,
what starts with four?

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.820
What zip codes start with four?

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.760
I have no idea.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.800
I don't know, let's say Forest, Texas.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.769
So, if I called it a four and
it really was a nine,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.750
it's supposed to go to California,
it goes to Texas.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.000
If I call it a, etc., it goes to te.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.970
So assuming that it's not any worse
ending up in Texas than it is, or

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.400
ending up in California, which is
a difficult assumption, I understand.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.130
See there are more people in
California than there are Texas, so

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.150
I have to in, so

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.060
my loss of insulting Texas is lower than
my loss of insulting Cal, oh nevermind.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.200
Okay, getting back to this.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.290
So I know what my losses are.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.650
The thing that I don't
know is the probabilities.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.180
Right?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.970
For a given x,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.490
how do I actually know what
the probability is that it's a four?

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.080
I have to somehow learn that or
know that.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.830
So who's going to help me?
