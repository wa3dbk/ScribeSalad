00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The correct answer is:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The numeral "1"--the digit--appears.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's go ahead and see this, for real.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay. Here we are in our browser.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We've got "the number one" selected.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When I click Submit, I see "q" equals the numeral "1"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because that's what we specified in the value parameter.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And if we selected one of these other options--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
let's go with "three" this time--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
when I click Submit, we see "q" equals the word "three"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
because that's what was the contents of the Option parameter.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And if you don't specify a value,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the value of the "q" parameter in the URL will default

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to the contents of the Option elements.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So if you want to have a different value in the URL--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that's different from the contents of the Option element--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that's what the value parameter is for.
