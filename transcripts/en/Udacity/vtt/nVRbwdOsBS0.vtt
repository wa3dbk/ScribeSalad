00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:00.950
All right, so

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.810
now we have this array of dictionaries
for each photo in the results.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.140
We could use the first photo
dictionary in the array and

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.520
populate the image view and
the label and call it done.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.915
But to get the user the best experience,

00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:17.775
we should pick a random photo from
these dictionaries so that a user has

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.900
a chance to see a different image each
time they press the button in the app.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.875
Let's start by generating a random index
that we can use to select a random photo

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:26.755
dictionary.

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:31.545
We can do this by using
the arc4random_uniform function and

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:36.040
this returns a number from zero
to the argument that we specify.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.100
In this case we want a number from
0 to the highest possible index

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.000
of the photoArray.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.040
And you'll notice that we've done this
casting to a UInt32 type because that's

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.450
what this function expects.

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:52.825
We'll do this in the same way that we
access the other values, but we want to

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:58.075
make sure that we use the randomly
chosen photo dictionary here and here.

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:00.665
And we convert both of
the values to strings.

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:04.419
So we're converting
the MediumURL to a string, and

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:07.760
we're converting the title
here to a string.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.705
Then to check that
everything works properly,

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:12.692
let's add some print statements and
run the app.

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:20.590
Awesome, now we're getting the URL and
the title.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.260
And I know this is a really long
bad title, but it is a title.
