00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now there's only one bit left--this generate sequence. Let's talk about that.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now sequence in this formulation is a function that takes x and y, two patterns,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and what it returns is a function, and that function takes a list of numbers

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and returns a set of text that match.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So sequence is delaying the calculation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's computing a function which can do the calculation later on.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Genseq does the calculation immediately.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It takes x and y and a set of numbers,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and it immediately calculates the set of possible text.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now the question is what do we know about genseq in terms of the patterns x and y

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the set of possible numbers.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We know at some point we're going to have to call the pattern x with some set of numbers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We're not yet quite sure what.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That's going to return a list of possible text.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Then we're going to have to call y with some other set of numbers.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Then we're going to have to concatenate them together and see if they make sense,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
if the concatenation of some x and some y, if that length is within this allowable set.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now, what do we know about what these Ns should be

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in terms of this set of possible numbers here regardless of what this set is.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This could be a dense set, so we could have Ns equals 0, 1, 2, all the way up to 10 or something.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Or it could be a sparse set.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It could be, say, only the number 10.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But either way, the restriction on x and y is such that they have to add up to no more than 10.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But x could be anything.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If the list of possible numbers that we want to add up to is only 10,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that doesn't constrain x at all other than to be less than 10.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This N should be everything up to the maximum of N sub s.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Then what should y be?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, we have two choices.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
One, we could for each x that comes back we could generate the y's.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Or we could generate the y's all at once and then try to combine them together

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and see if they match up. I think that's actually easier.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So for the y's also, they can be any size up to the maximum.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Then we take the two together, add up the x match and the y match

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and see if that length is within N.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In this example, if Ns is equal to 10,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
here we want to have the Ns be everything from 0 up to 10 inclusive in both cases,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and we get back some results like, say, a, abb, acde, and so on,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and some other result over here--ab, bcd.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Then for each of them we add them up,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and if we say abb plus ab and check to see if that's in Ns.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
If it is, we keep it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
If it's not, we don't keep it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Here is candidate solution for genseq.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We take x, y, and a set of numbers, and then we define Ns

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
as being everything up to the largest number, including the largest number.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We have to add 1 to the maximum number in order to get a range

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
going from 0 up to and including the largest number.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now that we know the possible values of the numbers that we're looking for

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
for the sizes of the two components-the x and the y components--

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
then we can say m1 is all the possible matches for x,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
m2 is all the possible matches for y.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
If the length of m1 plus m2 is in the original set of numbers that we're looking for,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
then return m1 plus m2.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This seems reasonable.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It looks like it's doing about what we're looking for to generate

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
all sequences of x and y concatenated together.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But I want you to think about it and say, have we really gotten this right?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The choices are is this function correct for all inputs?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Or is in incorrect for some?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Does it return incorrect results?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Or is it correct when it returns, but doesn't doesn't always return?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Think about that.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Think about is there any result that looks like it's incorrect that's being formed.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Think about does it infinite loop or not.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Think about base cases on recursion and saying is there any case where it looks like it might not return.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
This is a tricky question, so I want you to try it,

00:04:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but it may be difficult to get this one right.
