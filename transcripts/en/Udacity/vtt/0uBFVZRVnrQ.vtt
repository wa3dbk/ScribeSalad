00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi! Welcome to Office Hours for Unit 2.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Unfortunately, Steve couldn't be here this week.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He is at a wedding rehearsal right now.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So I'm going to handle your questions for him.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I already talked to him about them,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and let's just dive right in.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We had a lot of great questions, and there was a lot of overlap with them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So the first one that I'm going to talk about is about html templates:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
what they are, how to use them, when you should use them, and all of that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The html templates we're using are called "Jinja". That's a templating engine.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's included in AppEngine, which is nice because you don't have to install anything extra.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Django templating engine is also included if you'd like to try that out--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
at least according to the docs it's included in the templating engine.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We haven't used that, and we're not going to be going over that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We weren't planning on going over templates a whole lot,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but it sounds like there is quite a bit of demand for that,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so we'll try to put something together.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm going to link to the Jinja docs in the supplementary material under the videos.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So by the time you see this, they should be there.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Templates are a way to organize your html in a way that's easier than string substitution.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
String substitution can get a little hairy once you get very large html files,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and this helps you manage them--put them into separate files and folders--

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and Jinja is basically glorified string substitution

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
except that it helps you handle separating those out into multiple files and folders

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
so that you don't have to worry about it as much.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But we're going to be going into that in more depth later on.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So to everyone who asked that, thank you. Apparently, there is a lot of interest.
