00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.322
So let's take a look at the solution for this quiz. As defined before, we can

00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:07.042
go ahead and add the event listener objects to the canvas element for our

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:12.672
document specifying the mouse move and key down events. To be given these

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:15.785
functions. Looking at the filled in code, you can see that things are actually

00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:20.144
pretty simplistic. The event itself actually specifies client.x and client.y as

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:25.033
member variables that we can then query and print out to the console log. The

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:28.450
onKeyDown event, in contrast, is given a similar event objects, but rather than

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.270
having the client.x and client.y variables it actually has the keyID variable.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.580
Which specifies the ASCII value of the key that was pressed on the keyboard.
