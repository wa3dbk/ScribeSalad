00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.572
&gt;&gt; Now, if we don't look at these, you've seen that the average salary of

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:09.454
Geography majors is about 48,000. However, in the mid 1980s, the average

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:14.668
starting salary of Geography students at the University of North Carolina was

00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:20.008
well over 100,000. Why was this? Well, maybe UNC had a really good Geography

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:25.684
program or UNC's career services program found top-tier jobs for students, or

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:31.346
maybe salaries in North Carolina were just higher in the 1980s. Actually, it's

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:36.741
because Michael Jordan graduated from there and his starting salary was over

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:42.122
$500,000. So, you saw that the mode isn't influenced by an outlier at all, but

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:46.865
the mean is influenced a lot. We need something in between. This is where the

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:49.755
median comes in, which is the middle of the data.
