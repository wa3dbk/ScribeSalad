00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.563
let's start with the smimplest polynomial, a monomial. A monomial consists of

00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:09.105
only one term, and it could contain the product of numbers and variables. When

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.259
we see a number next to a variable, we assume that there's a multiplication

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.797
between the two. But, like many things in math, we don't often show it. Here are

00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:22.778
lot of examples of monomials. I've rearranged our monomials into certain groups.

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:27.002
Here's a group of four monomials, and in this group, I have a constant

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:31.892
coefficient and a variable. The variable is x in three of these, but it doesn't

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:36.257
always have to be. In this one, it's y. These monomials are simply just

00:00:36.257 --> 00:00:41.175
constants. They don't even contain variables. This monomial is negative and it

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:45.947
contains variables with exponents. Monomials can be positive or negative, like

00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:50.508
in the first group. And finally, this last group shows an example where we have

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:55.464
a constant coefficient and multiple variables multiplied together. Each of these

00:00:55.464 --> 00:00:57.120
is an example of a monomial.
