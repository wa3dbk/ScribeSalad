00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.170
In this lesson, we're going to talk about, how

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.340
to build your web applications, to be wicked fast. But

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.540
first, I want to make sure, that you understand, why performance,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.790
is so critically important, to your bottom line. For example,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.870
let's say you accidentally, introduce a performance issue, that

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.430
causes your page to take an extra half second to

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.070
load. That's just 500 milliseconds. That's a pretty small difference.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.420
What kind of difference, in user engagement ,do you think

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.970
this would cause? No, discernible change? A 1% drop, in user engagement?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.000
A 1% gain, in user engagement, or a 5%, drop in engagement?
