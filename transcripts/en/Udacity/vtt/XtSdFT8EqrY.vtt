00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I want you to do next is look at a more complex data set.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In this data set, we study the height of people in inches from a data set I got from the web.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Here is the data set of people and their individual heights--all ranging between

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
about 65 and 72 inches, and I want you to do a histogram plot

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
following the example I've given you.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Remember histplot is the command for histogram plot, and I didn't call the data "data."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I actually called it height--so try to assemble the right command

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to plot the data and look at it because I'll ask you a question about it.
