00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.469
So now let's dive into understanding what an image gradient is.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.791
To help us define an image gradient, let's take the example of

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:10.549
this sample image again, where we're interested in is at each and

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.207
every point we want to compute the gradient.

00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:17.126
And with respect to the neighborhood that we're in traversing and

00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:19.820
again the both dimensions of the image.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.540
A Gradient basically is defined as a measure of change in an Image function.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.900
So that at this point, what are the changes of the image function with

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.320
respect to how things change in the x direction or

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.990
in this case, the columns or the y direction, the rows of an image?

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.200
We'd like to be able to compute this both in discontinuous and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.790
the continuous form.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.990
So how do we define it mathematically?

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.280
So basically, the differential of the function F,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.130
which represents an image, with respect to x.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.020
And then differential of the function image F, with respect to y.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.380
And of course, both dimensions of this is represented by the del F,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.930
is the gradient of the image F.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.310
In essence, this is the way to measure the change in image function F,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.530
in both x and y.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.900
Let's look at that with a couple of simple examples.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.440
Let's take a simple ramp image here, starts with a dark value,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.190
let's say zero, to 255 where the pure white is.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.440
At this point, I want to be able to measure the change of this image function,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.710
as respect to how it is in this neighborhood here.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.930
Very obvious if you take the same function here, you notice that all of

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.120
the change in this direction is for the x direction, none for the y.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.700
So that of course, this is a very simple case where you can just represent

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.000
the del of F is nothing else at this point to be this function here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.300
The counter, of course, is when there is a pixel and actually it's now, or

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.610
this image here as a ramp here.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.640
And of course, going from two fifth, 0 to 255,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.430
from this point onwards, and, and in this case, we can

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.760
simply look at that there is not going to be any change in the x direction.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.870
That seems to be fixed, and just in the y direction.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.740
Combining these two,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.080
we can look at if the changes are in both directions, then they will be,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.640
of course the gradient direction would be at an angle, which is there.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.950
In essence, what that basically means now is that the gradient point

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.740
in the direction of the most rapid increase in intensity.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.670
&gt;From here, the intensity is increasing rapidly in this direction, less so

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.010
in this or this direction, so this is my most dominant angle.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.400
Let's look at this a little bit more carefully.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.340
How would we compute the gradient direction?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.570
Just take the inverse of the tangent, I mean,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.060
this is my vector, del F with x and y.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.700
If I know the y and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.570
the x changes, I can basically now do the inverse tangent to get data.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.730
The magnitude of this vector, which would of course be the modulus of

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.760
this value here, which would be the square plus square, square root.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.470
So I have this thing, it'll give me the magnitude of the vector.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.440
So the angle of the vector and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.520
the magnitude of the vector are the ones we're looking for, and

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.440
that would basically define the gradient at any point in an image.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.627
So while we're at it one thing I want everybody to think about is how does this,

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:12.793
how does this relate to edge direction.

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:17.479
When I have a point here and I have the gradient direction here the theta and

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.480
the magnitude.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.310
Where is the edge?

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.120
Hopefully you will have the answer in a bit.
