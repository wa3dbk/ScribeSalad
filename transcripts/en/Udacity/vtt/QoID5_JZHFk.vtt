00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.642
Research in education differs from
research in other areas in a number of

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:05.840
ways, so I'm going to talk
about two of them here.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.564
One of those ways is the difficulty we
have controlling all the variables at

00:00:09.564 --> 00:00:11.350
play in educational research.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.600
We have interactions amongst students,
amongst students and teachers,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.250
amongst the classroom,
amongst the broader school culture, and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.290
we can't control for
all of those things.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.240
So one of our difficulties is
in understanding the full range

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.458
of different variables and
dynamics at play.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.050
Another interesting thing in educational
research is that very often we're not

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.470
just interested in understanding
learning or understanding education.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.290
I think most of us get into this
field because we want to improve it.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.310
That we want to help
students learn better.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.700
And so when you're sitting in
a classroom observing something and

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.090
you recognize a reason why a student's
having trouble learning some material,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.630
it's very difficult not to intervene and

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.140
help them because that's
why we're doing this.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.870
And yet, if our main goal
is to understand learning,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.290
then we can't do that.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.620
So for these reasons among others,
a field exists especially in educational

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.665
research, although it exists elsewhere
as well, called design-based research.

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:03.050
Design-based research is the idea
of creating something, and

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.519
then using that something,
that tool, that protocol,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.875
that behavior, as a probe into classroom
interaction, or the learning process.

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:14.285
What we do here is effectively
build a tool that would work,

00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:16.025
if our theory of learning is accurate.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:19.665
For example, if we're interested
in individualized feedback.

00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:22.415
If we believe that students learn
better from individualized feedback,

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.375
we would create a tool that uses
individualized feedback, or

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:27.655
gives students individualized feedback.

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:31.120
And then based on whether or not that
tool actually improves learning,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.280
we would reflect back
on our original theory.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.920
If the tool gives students
individualized feedback and they don't

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.930
improve in their understanding of some
material, then we might reflect and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.460
say that theory that I used to
justify that tool was actually false.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.130
I don't have any evidence to defend
the idea that that's useful.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.640
But then if that tool actually
does work, we would say,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.780
because I developed a tool that
improved individualized feedback and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.660
because students learned as a result,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.488
my theory about individualized feedback
helping learning must be accurate.

00:01:56.488 --> 00:02:00.420
So in designed-based research, we're
designing tools, then using those tools

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.110
as probes into the phenomenon that
those tools are designed to address.
