00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, let's look at one more example and this time we go to a bank and hope to get a fair coin

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This going coin over here and our alternate hypothesis is a two-sided hypothesis

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with a probability either is smaller than 0.5 or larger than 0.5 which provide us p≠0.5.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The way to know where this concept will lead, in all we've done so far,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we assume that H₀ is correct and we've computed some sort of distribution and then we cut out

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
a critical region such as the volume underneath with smaller input of 5%,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
assuming you a 5% confidence.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now in the two-sided test, what we do is cover the smaller region on the left but also one on the right,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
such that the area on the left doesn't exceed half of 5%

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that is 2.5% and the same for the area on the right.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Now, we've moved the critical region into two areas.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We have a two-sided test now that's called a two-tailed test

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and in totality, the two critical regions on the left and right don't exceed 5%.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This looks awfully like a confidence interval, right?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Let's flip the coin. In 14 experiments, heads comes out exactly 3 times

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and 11 times it comes out tails.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Let's do the analysis. So in this table, I've graphed to you the probabilities

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
under the binomial distribution for each possible outcome, from 0 to 14 as before.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We go 0, 0.005, 0.22, 0.06, 0.12, 0.18, 0.21--this is obviously

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
the most likely outcome for the null hypothesis and then it goes down

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
exactly the way it went up over here.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I've also added check boxes. I want you to check exactly those that define the critical region,

00:02:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so the total probability in the critical region does not exceed 5% and remember this is a two-tailed test.
