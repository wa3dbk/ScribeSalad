00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.950
So let's get back to thinking about how modules help the search engine. And we

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.125
divided the search engine into these two modules crawler, and search. And there

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:11.390
weren't any actual imports between them. That suggests that there aren't any

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.031
actual dependencies. But the lack of explicit dependencies doesn't actually mean

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:18.532
that there aren't any dependencies between these modules. So for this quiz, I

00:00:18.532 --> 00:00:22.012
want you to think about the ways the search module depends on the crawler

00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:26.324
module. And you may need to look at the code, it's linked below. The choices are

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:31.328
how the links are extracted. What add<u>to</u>index does. What names are defined in

00:00:31.328 --> 00:00:35.533
crawler. How the index and ranks are represented and how the ranks are computed.
