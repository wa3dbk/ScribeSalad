00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.560
What are some of the goals of
the authentication process itself?

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.400
So remember, authentication in
a nutshell is a user convincing a system

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.910
who he or she is, so
using some technique or some method.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.255
So obviously we're talking about the
user associated with a certain identity.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:24.730
Username for example, wanting to
authenticate herself to the system.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.610
Whatever authentication method we use,
what do we desire from it,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.640
what should be its goal?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.360
First of all, when a legitimate
user tries to authenticate herself,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.640
the system can demand some evidence but
when the right evidence is provided,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.970
the system should allow the login
to complete successfully.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.930
Well, that is called availability, okay?

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.980
The system is available to the user
who's able to provide the right evidence

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.960
to support the claim, for
example, the user is Alice.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.670
So the system should be
available to the legitimate

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.460
user who is able to provide
the correct evidence.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.580
In other words, we don't want
to have any false negatives.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.500
So let's just spend a little bit
of time on what do we mean by

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.300
this phrase false negative
that I have here.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.480
So negative refers to the outcome.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.490
So if the authentication process
is successfully complete,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490
that is a positive outcome.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.630
A negative outcome is when we deny
the authentication request or

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.760
the login request.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.830
So if, for some reason,
believe the evidence is not right or

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.130
whatever it is, so we're going to say
login unsuccessful, for example, or

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.230
authentication unsuccessful.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.360
If it's the right user providing
the right evidence and

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.720
the system still has a negative outcome,
well that is incorrect.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.760
In fact, that outcome we see is not
a correct outcome, that result is false.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.350
The user was the right one
with the right evidence.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.220
Whatever method we're using,
perhaps, has a problem and

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.470
because of that it's not
able to allow the user in.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.310
So if the outcome is negative and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.870
that's done incorrectly that
is called a false negative.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.750
So false negative basically means
when we incorrectly deny access or

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.400
incorrectly decline an authentication
request, we don't want to have that.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.450
We have an authentication method,
we don't want it to deny

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.360
authentication requests for right
users who provide the right evidence.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.190
Well the other possibility
is the bad person,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.570
Eve, is trying to impersonate her.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.070
So Eve walks up to the system and
says I am Alice.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.840
So it's the user principal that
is associated with identity,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.930
which is Alice.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.080
It's really not her and it's Eve, so

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.510
the user or principal who is not
associated with Alice identity,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.400
we don't want that person,
or Eve, to be able to login.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.480
Well, if you had a guarantee,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.030
then we have authenticity in
the authentication process.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.480
If we authenticate someone, we know for
sure that it is that person, so

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.490
that's the authenticity part.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.230
And another way to sort of think about
this is that we don't want to have any

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.380
false positives.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.960
So positive here refers to the outcome
of the authentication process.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.860
Positive means we allow someone
to login or authenticate.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.820
And false means we
actually make a mistake.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.870
We do that incorrectly.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.870
If Eve is able to login as Alice,
that is not right.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.520
That is incorrect.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.440
So that's a false positive.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.170
So we don't want to have
any false positives.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.640
The second goal that we have for
authentication is that

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.100
the right user with the right identity
and evidence should be allowed in.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.310
That means we have no false negatives,
and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.020
somebody who is going to
impersonate a user of the system

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.470
should not be allowed in which means
we should not have any false positives.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.300
So these are the goals of
a good authentication method

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.310
that you would want to
implement in your system.
