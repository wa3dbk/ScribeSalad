00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.150
I started teaching myself how to
program around the age of 12, and

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.970
quickly fell in love with web
development, specifically.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.910
I got my first freelancing gig in 1996,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.740
so I've survived quite a lot of
changes as the web has evolved.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.270
As developers we're learning
pretty difficult concepts and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.580
solving hard problems all the time.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.190
The best was to accomplish
this is to get into the zone,

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.830
where time just flies by and you're
highly engaged in what you're doing.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.550
To get to that point, you have to
be comfortable in your environment.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.780
&gt;From keyboard shortcuts and
color schemes to window positions.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.540
When I'm working on a new project or
learning something new,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.050
I always place my windows in
the exact same position on-screen.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.600
My editor taking up the left half.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.310
A browser taking up the right half.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.690
And my terminal, up and running, so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.370
I can easily get to it
with a keyboard shortcut.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.170
&gt;&gt; Even experienced programmers
are constantly learning new things.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.780
As Mike explained, setting up your
workspace for success is key.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.630
Next, we'll give you some tips and

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.790
walk you through how to set up
your own personal workspace.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.250
To start we'll make sure Python is
installed properly on your computer.
