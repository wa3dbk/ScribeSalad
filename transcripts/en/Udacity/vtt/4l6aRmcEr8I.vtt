00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.866
The only solution for this equation, is positive 8. Great algebra skills for

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:08.850
getting this one correct. We'll take the same steps to try and solve this.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.740
First we'll isolate the radical on one side of the equation. And lucky for us,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.415
it already is. Next we'll square both sides, and then try and factor our

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:20.621
quadratic. When we square both sides, we'll get ax squared minus 6a plus 9 on

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:25.826
the left, and 3a plus 1 on the right. We move these terms to the other side of

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:30.653
the equation, so that way we can set it equal to 0. We factor a squared minus

00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:34.960
9a plus 8, since the factors of 8 that sum to negative 9 are negative 1 and

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.400
negative 8. We solve for the factors of a by setting each factor equal to 0.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.094
So, a could be positive 8 or a could be positive 1. Next we want to check

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:53.819
positive 8 and positive 1 in the original equation. Plugging in x equals 8, we

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:58.558
get a true statement of 5 equals 5. When we plug in x equals 1, we don't end up

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:04.489
with a true statement. We'll have negative 2 equals 2. Since this doesn't

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.744
check, we know x equals 1 is not part of our solution set. We'll just have the

00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:11.503
answer x equals 8.
