00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.469
At least two lines of research have looked at the critical importance of

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.984
bonding, attachment, and social stimulation in a child's development. First, is

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:12.943
Harry Harlow. In the 1950s, he wanted to examine what was more important: food

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:17.314
or affection. Now, for ethical reasons you'll see in a moment he was unable to

00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:20.835
use human infants. So instead, he used baby monkeys.

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:26.240
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; He did so by manipulating food and affection. He created two mothers. One was a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.247
wire mother that offered food. The other was a cloth mother that offered

00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:31.955
affection and warmth.

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:36.050
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now the baby monkeys had an opportunity to chose either mother.
