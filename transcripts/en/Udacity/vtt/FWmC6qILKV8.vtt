00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:03.690
Explanation based learning is a very common classroom task, you and

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.080
I appear to do it all the time. We can use a chair to prop open a door, and

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.380
we can deliver a very quick explanation for why the chair is a good prop.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.180
We can use a coffee mug to hold down a pile of papers, and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.980
pull out an explanation for why the coffee mug would make a good paper weight.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.630
Of course there is a lot more to it than we have discussed sso far.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.630
Explanation based learning is central [INAUDIBLE] on cognitive science, because

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.870
we are trying to build human like, human level intelligence. Explanations and

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.090
explanation based learning nowhere is prominent in other schools of AI.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.700
Second, note that humans are not very good at explaining everything.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.020
We can only explain those things which appear to be consciously accessible.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.880
We have a hard time explaining memory processes, for

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.830
example, or we have a hard time explaining certain kinds of physical actions.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.340
For example, when I play tennis, my feet move the way they do, and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.460
I can't explain to you why I can't make them move better. Third, although we

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.860
can generate explanations, this does not necessarily mean that our process for

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.080
generating explanation is the same process that we use to arrive at the decision

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.325
in the first place. Explanations can be post talk. Further, the very act

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:17.685
of [UNKNOWN] explanations could interfere with the reasoning process.

00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:19.010
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.375
However, when we can generate explanations, it can lead to much deeper,

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.871
much richer understanding and learning,

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:30.317
because it exposes the cause of connections. Finally, for AI systems to be

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:34.919
accepted in our society they must be able to generate good explanations. You,

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:38.311
for example, will be unlikely to accept the advice of a medical

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:42.413
diagnostic system if the diagnostic system cannot explain it's answers.

00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:46.731
I must be able to explain it's answers as well as the process it used to

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:50.880
arrive at those answers. Explanation is fundamental to trust.
