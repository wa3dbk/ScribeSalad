00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.828
So, as we decided in an earlier quiz, we're going to divide the search engine

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:08.170
code into two modules. One corresponds to the things that we do before, one of

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.720
which is about building the corpus, this is all the things that we can do before

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.234
a search query comes in. Another one is the code for all the things that we do

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:21.290
after a query. I'm going to give those names. We'll call the first module,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.684
crawler, since what is does is crawls the web and builds a corpus. This also

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:29.950
includes the page ranking which we might think could be a separate module.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.620
That's something we can do after we finish the crawl. For now, we'll keep that

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.950
in the crawler module. And we'll call the other module search.py. Once we've

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.250
divided code into modules like this, well, we shouldn't need to worry about all

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.210
these details anymore. So, for now, we're going to assume we don't need any of

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.760
those and we'll give these modules names. The first one we'll call crawler and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.523
we'll put it in a file called crawler.py. And the second one we'll call search,

00:00:55.523 --> 00:00:59.139
and we'll put it in the file search.py. We're going to need to know something

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.733
more about these, and that's what the next quiz is going to get at.
