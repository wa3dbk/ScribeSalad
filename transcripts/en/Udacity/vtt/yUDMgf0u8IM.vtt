00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, now, I would like to go back to the drawing of a software under test

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that I feel like I've drawn about 30 times already

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and recall that this provides APIs and most of the time that's we're fuzzing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, on the other hand, the software under test uses APIs like the UNIX Recall,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we could do fuzzing at this level as well and this most often called fault injection when we do that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and run a fault injection, as we discussed, is extremely powerful.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We've looked at examples of both of these and both of them are incredibly useful.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What I like to talk about now is fuzzing of the implicit inputs, we talked about unit too,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where we have non-API inputs to the software under test that affect it's behavior

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that turns out that this is often pretty important, and so, how we'd do this?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, as we mentioned earlier, possibly the most important implicit input is the timing at which

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
different threads are on different processors.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is to say the thread scheduler provides a very important form of implicit input

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to multithreaded software under test.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
An extremely important technique is perturbing the schedule.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And as far as I know, there isn't a single best way to do this,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and so we find in practices, people do a lot of different things.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
One thing you can do is just generate load on the machine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That is to say, make sure that your testing is not happening on the complete idle machine.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It is often the case that if you test software on a completely idle single core machine,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
even if it has multiple threads, those threads will be scheduled in a quite deterministic way.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Similarly, if you have a multicore machine that has more processors,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
then your application of threads, there is again a strong possibility it will be scheduled

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
on an extremely deterministic fashion while you're doing testing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And if they are being scheduled extremely deterministically, that means that the scheduler

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is exploring only a very tiny fraction of the full set of possible thread schedules

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and what that mean is concurrency bugs are going to go unfound during testing.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, generating load by running apps--generating load by running other application is important.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Generating network activity on a machine can also be valuable.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And network activity is interesting because incoming network fax machine

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
caused interrupt handlers to fire and they cause lots of kernel routines to run

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It caused cache lines to be stolen away from your application

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and this causes some perturbation of the schedule.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There also exist specialized tool for stress testing of multithreaded applications.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And if you have one that is available too,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it would be an extremely good idea to use it to help task your multithreaded code.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Okay, so I discovered is what I will call external pertubation to the threads

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Also possible, previous software to introduce perturbations internally and one way to do that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
is to do things like concerting delays before and after acquiring locks

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and also around accesses to shared variables.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This entails a fairly high cost--this isn't so easy, but on the other hand, it might be useful.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And I heard a story one time, there was about a group of researchers who are working on

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
formal methods based tools for finding bugs and threaded codes

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and these researchers were having some sort of a competition where each of them try to find

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
the most bugs in the software under test that they could,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and what happened was, somebody showed up and just put a bunch of sleeps inside the application

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and showed that they could find just as many bugs as this super heavy weight,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
super complicated formal methods tool.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So, the final thing you can try is what I'm going to call "unfriendly emulators."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Put that in qoutes, I kind of just making up that name.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But these are--it's kind of special virtual machine or other run time

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that's especially designed to stress test your application by doing things like

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
invalidating cache lines, invoking thread schedules in odd ways, and other things.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And so, there are some these kind of things generally available,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and if one of them fits the needs of whatever your software under test is, you should definitely use it.
