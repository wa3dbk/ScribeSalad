00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.910
Absolute value of positive a is just the distance from that to 0, a minus 0is

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.615
just a. But the same is true of negative a. It takes just as much distance to

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:14.103
get from negative a to 0, as it did from a to 0. So that's the absolute value of

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:18.412
negative a is a. So if a number is positive, it's absolute value is just equal

00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:23.357
to itself. And if a number is negative, we get the absolute value by multiplying

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.047
that number by negative 1.
