00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.260
So before we get started with the analysis in this lesson, I want to talk

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.210
a little bit about the general process of questioning, modeling and validating.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.871
The purpose of the iterative QMV process of analysis is meant to

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:18.579
take a vague question and turn it into something that is answerable.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.389
We start with something that is vague and general.

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:24.872
For example, when will a person tweet next?

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:28.656
And we try to turn it into something that is quantitative, concrete and

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:32.180
with uncertainty bounds that are clearly indicated.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.710
A good way to think about this process is like a camera looking at

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.930
something initially out of focus.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.090
Over time, we slowly bring it into focus.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.800
The important thing to note is that this is a process of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.930
discovery and exploration.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.380
Like exploration, we initially don't really know anything about the problem.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.190
It's only through the iterations that we come to understand the problem, or

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.730
even what the questions are that we should be asking.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.160
For example, initially we think that the really important thing to ask is,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.330
when will the person tweet next?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.030
But only after performing an investigation, we might discover that

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.880
the more important question is, what is this person's immediate social network?

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.750
Now, let's get started with a real problem.
