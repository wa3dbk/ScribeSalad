00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:01.770
Maybe you should help me finish this picture here.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.840
So what we've got is X1 is our variable

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.170
and so we can take on any sort of

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.570
values. And I marked negative one, zero, and one here.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.770
And if we're doing not, right, then what should

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.160
the output be for each of these different values

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.100
of X1? So like if the, if the, if X1 is zero, then we want the output to be.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.700
&gt;&gt; one.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.940
&gt;&gt; One. And if X1 is one, we want the output to be

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.480
&gt;&gt; Zero.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.032
&gt;&gt; Zero.

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:29.410
All right, so now what we'd like you to do is say okay, what should weight one

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.884
be and what should theta be so that this,

00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:33.860
you get, we get this kind of knot behavior.
