00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.890
Hopefully, arrays are starting
to make sense to you.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.689
Let's quickly look at
them in another way.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.750
You can think of an array
kind of like this.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.640
It's a set of boxes where each
has an address called an index.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.980
This paper chain is more similar to
a construct called a linked list.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.600
A linked list is an extension of a list,
but it's definitely not an array.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.430
There are still some things that have
order, but there are no indices.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.780
Instead, a linked list is characterized,
well, by its links.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.770
Each element has some notion of what
the next element is since it's connected

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.350
to it, but not necessarily how long
the list is or where it is in the list.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.960
An array is different.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.700
There is nothing in one
element of the array that says

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.760
here's your next element.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.420
You know what the next element
is by what the next index is.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.820
My first thought when I heard this
was why would anybody ever want to

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.910
use a linked list, an array gives you
more information since you already

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.900
know where the next element
falls in the array.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.679
However, as we discussed before,
adding and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.590
removing elements from an array
can be really complicated.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.960
Adding and removing elements from
a linked list turns out to be so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.949
easy by comparison.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.780
You can actually just take
an element out or add one in.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.399
There's only one real quick
consideration here, but

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.440
we'll talk about that in a minute.
