00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
So, here's the correct answers. The first one, 2^n&lt;i&gt;log(n).&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.260
That is clearly an exponential running time because 2^n is exponential.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.100
Now, what about the next one, 2^log(n).

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.810
Well, 2^log(n) is actually O(n) because...

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.560
So, having the logarithm and exponent, well, actually cancel out the exponents. So, that is O(n).

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.570
So, although it might look exponential, if you don't look closely enough,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.680
that is actually a polynomial running time.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.380
Now, O(1.00001^n), that is going to be a very, very slowly growing function,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.160
but nevertheless, it's exponential.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.290
So, this is the correct answer, and n^1000, that's basically the opposite.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.410
It's  a polynomial that will grow rapidly fast

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.380
and you would never want an algorithm actually with that running time,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.760
but nevertheless, it is a polynomial running time.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.500
Now, this is algorithm--well, you already figured that out I guess because it's 2^n&lt;i&gt;n²,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.830
that is an exponential running time algorithm, that's why it's really bad.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.880
Now, as you see with those two examples here,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.850
there's something to be said about saying that we consider polynomial running time to be acceptable

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.500
and exponential running time to unacceptable,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.200
but in general, what you will find is that polynomial time algorithms

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.420
tend to have a running time of n² or n³.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320
So, there is not really any algorithm that I would know of,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.750
at least now that make sense that has a running time like this.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.950
So, it's kind of okay from empirical experience to call a polynomial time algorithm,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.250
actually one with an acceptable running time,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.140
and the same thing is with exponential running time.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.340
So, when you have an exponential time algorithm,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.190
you will not have one that has in the base of figure like 1.00001^n.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.590
For some algorithms, you might have 1.1 or 1.2,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.940
but even then, it's a fairly rapidly growing function.

00:01:52.940 --> 99:59:59.000
So, it's also okay to call exponential running time algorithms unacceptable in general.
