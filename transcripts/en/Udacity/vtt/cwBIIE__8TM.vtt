00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.326
Let's see if you can put this together. Try and answer this question. What are

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:08.574
the bases and exponents of these expressions in simplified form? Write your

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:12.939
bases and exponents in each of the boxes. And remember, this 3 has an exponent

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:17.286
of 1, when the exponent isn't listed, we assume it to be 1, the same is true for

00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:21.763
the c. Also for these numbers, don't worry about multiplying them out. For

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:25.850
example, if you have the base of 7 in your answer, leave it as a base of 7 with

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.023
some exponent as the number. As always, try your best and feel free to play

00:00:30.023 --> 00:00:33.292
around with these exponents, it's okay to make a mistake.
