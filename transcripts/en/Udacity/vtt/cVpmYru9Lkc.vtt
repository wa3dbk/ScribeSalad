00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A better random tester for these functions would set off making a completely random

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and then randomly flipping a random number of bits, so here we're going to make a random number

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
between 0 and 63 and flip that many bits.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We can make a much better random tester for this particular code by making a random

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then making b a mutated function of a, so it's like that how to do that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We're going to still make a totally random. All right.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So what we want to do is change our random number generator and here we're going to be

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
slowing it down by adding a nested loop, so I've changed the number of total random test

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to 10,000 instead of 100,000, and so what we want to do is a is still a completely randomly

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
regenerated 64-bit number and now what we're going to do is initialize b to be a

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and now for j in 0 to 63.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
For j in 0 to 63, so that is for some random number between 0 and 63, we're going to flip the sense

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
using Python's XOR operator with one random bit at the input.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And now our new test case is going to be a and a changed version of a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
with the idea that that's going to be a better test case.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Let's see if that is indeed the case. So now we've completely covered our code.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There are 27 statements. All of them ran with no partial executions.
