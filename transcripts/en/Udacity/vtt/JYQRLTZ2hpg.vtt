00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.530
Statecharts add quite a few features. We're going to be looking at

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.180
the first two because they're the ones that give the greatest benefit. But

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.530
I'll mention also some of the others, okay?

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.310
In particular number one thing is statecharts offer nesting or depth, okay?

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.120
That is, a particular state in a statechart can be its own state machine.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.860
And you can zoom in that way. Secondly, they offer concurrency. Imagine

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.355
that you have two things going on, each of which can have a number of states.

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:38.010
Recall from state transition diagrams that in order to model that we have to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.140
multiply the number of states. Statecharts allow you to treat those separately,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.250
okay? Therefore, only getting an additive number of states rather than

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.420
a multiplicative number of states. Of course once you've done that,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.790
that is separated the concurrent machines into two parts, you still have to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.185
synchronize them. That is, they still have to cooperate somehow, and

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:03.200
statecharts offers a way of doing that called broadcast events.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.170
We'll look at that. And of course you could also use data conditions which

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.220
are globally available to both machines. We'll look at entry exit actions,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.010
we'll look at event parameters, we'll look at history, and

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.790
of course the default states that we've already seen the icons for.
