00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, for the moment I want to get back to this other idea

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of moving along the elegance direction without changing

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the other dimensions, and that's often called "refactoring."

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That is, we take a program, and we change it around

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
not that it does something different but that it's clearer

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and easier to maintain.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, here's a line from my hand&lt;u&gt;rank program&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that bothers me a little bit, and what bothers me here

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is I'm repeating myself, so I'm asking

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
do we have 3 of a kind in the ranks, and do we have 2 of a kind in the ranks?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay, if we do, that's a full house, and then what are we going to return?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
6 is the marker for a full house, and then the 3 of a kind

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the 2 of a kind.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But I'm repeating myself, and so that violates

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
what's known as the "Don't repeat yourself" principle

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or sometimes called "DRY."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I thought to myself is there a different way to do this?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Can I refactor my routine so that I'm not repeating myself,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so that I only have to say this once?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And in doing that, I came up with a different representation for a hand,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
for the ranks of a hand.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Consider this hand.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We have a 7, a 10, a 7,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a 9, and another 7.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, in the representation we have so far--and note I'm leaving out

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the suits here, they don't matter--in the representation we have so far,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we would sort these in order.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We'd have the 10 and the 9 and the three 7s,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then we'd go through and we'd say is there 3 of a kind,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is there 4 of a kind, is there 2 of a kind, and so on.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But I want to come up now with a representation

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that takes into account everything we need to know about this hand,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and I can do that using this function that I'll call "group."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We group this hand, and group is going to return 2 values.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
First it's going to return the counts for each of the different kinds

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
of card ranks, and so here

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we have three 7s and one 10 and one 9.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And those counts are going to be sorted biggest first.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And then the second value that groups is going to return

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is the card ranks for each of these,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and so what did we have 3 of?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We had three 7s. And what do we have 1 of?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Well, 10s and 9s, and we're going to put those in order of biggest first.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This representation of taking this hand

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and turning it into a counts and a list of ranks

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is in some ways a better representation of exactly

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
how a poker hand counts.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Here's the new hand&lt;u&gt;rank function using this new representation for hands.&lt;/u&gt;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We call it in the same way. We pass in a hand.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And now we create the groups and pull out the counts and the ranks,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and then we do what we did before where we say

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we have to deal with the ace-high straight,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and so change the ranks if we have to.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And then similarly to before, we check to see if we have a straight or a flush,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and now we can check for what the results are, and here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
we're returning a single number, 0 through 9,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and in every case we return the ranks.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Know that what we're doing here is we're actually

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
changing the signature of hand&lt;u&gt;rank.&lt;/u&gt;

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This version of hand&lt;u&gt;rank is going to return different results&lt;/u&gt;

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
than the previous version of hand&lt;u&gt;rank, but that's okay&lt;/u&gt;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
because it's still going to work in conjunction

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
with our evaluation in that it's going to return the higher value

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
for the higher hand, even though it's returning slightly different values.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Why is it slightly different?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Because we're only returning a single number,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and then we always return the set of ranks,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and those ranks are there even when they aren't needed,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so for example, when we have a straight, we don't really need all the cards in the ranks.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And in the previous version of hand&lt;u&gt;rank, we only return the high card.&lt;/u&gt;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Here we're returning all of them, and what we do

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is we go through and we say, "What are the counts?"

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
If the counts are just 5 of a kind, that's the highest.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Otherwise we check for straight and flush, like we did before.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Otherwise 4 of a kind, and the only way we can have 4 of a kind

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is if the counts are 4 and 1.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Otherwise we check for a full house, and the only way we can have a full house

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
is if the counts are 3 and 2.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Then we look for flush and straight. Those are next in order.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Then we look for 3 of a kind.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The only way to have 3 of a kind is 3, 1, 1.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
2 pairs has to be 2, 2, 1.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
One pair has to be 2, 1, 1, 1.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And then high card would be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but we don't have to explicitly check for that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We just have 0 as the final value.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
This is simpler. We're not repeating ourselves.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We have a nice representation here.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Also, one thing that I really like about this representation

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
is it showed me a new fact about poker hands

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that I had never realized before, and that if we look at these values,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
(5,) (4, 1) (3, 2) (3, 1, 1) (2, 2, 1) (2, 1, 1, 1)

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and then here--I haven't written it but it would be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1--

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
these are all the partitions of the number 5,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
so in mathematics, a partition of an integer

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
is the set of numbers that add up to that integer.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And for the number 5, that partitions into 7 possible ways,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and it turns out that poker recognizes all 7 of those as a different thing.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Poker has a name for all the partitions,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and the even more amazing thing is look,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
they're in lexicographic order.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
If we sort the 7 partitions, they're in exactly

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the same order as the poker hands.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
5 comes first, that's the highest.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
4, 1 comes next. That's the next highest, and so on.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I never knew that before about the mapping between poker hands

00:05:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and partitions, but this representation of hand rank makes it clear.
