00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.920
I'm Kevin, I'm a friend and
programmer here at Udacity.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.070
The most exciting thing about
front end programming for

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.770
me is creating a pleasing and
intuitive user experiences.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.540
The most difficult challenge that I face
as a front end programmer is meeting

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.440
the requirements of a project as
well as satisfying my own desire to

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.920
have elegant code.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.820
You're always trying to meet a deadline.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.610
That's a constant struggle of
how perfect can I get this and

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.070
still deliver on time.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.960
The approach I try to take is to really
understand what your product manager or

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.860
consumer want and iron out the most
basic functionality first,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.750
get it to a point where they can look at
it, critique it and give you feedback.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.900
In the remaining time you have, that's
where you get to the interesting and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.550
fun work of polishing the experience.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.100
Front end is a pretty diverse field.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.930
Even when I find myself
with a heavy workload,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.099
I find it very easy to stay motivated
and stay engaged in the work that I do

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.290
because I believe that it does
have a really positive impact.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.490
So to me that's kind of a sign that
this is the right path for me.
