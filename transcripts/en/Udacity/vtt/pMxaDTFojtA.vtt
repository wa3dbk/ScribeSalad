We've done a ton of work so far and we're super close to getting t by itself.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.960
So here's the equation we have right now. 3t minus 2 equals log base 2 of 3.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.960
I'd like you to solve this equation for t coming up with just a number that

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.460
it's equal to. Please round the solution that you get to three decimal places.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.916
Now just a hint, in order to use your calculator to evaluate this you're going

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:30.229
to need to change bases. So keep that in mind as you move forward.
