00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.480
Real quick the state model l of t for
location.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.040
So, you can use just x and
y if you think it's just translating.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.700
You can use the similarity transform
which is x y rotation feta and a scale,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.620
that would be four parameters.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.610
Or you might do a affine defamation if
you're going to allow things to skew

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.630
a little bit.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.370
It doesn't really matter.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.870
You just have to have some model and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.600
some way of saying I'm going to be
able to represent these elements.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.050
What's my dynamics model?

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.980
Well my dynamics, dynamics model that
they use was actually very simple.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.200
They said, and this is just written P
of L1, given L0, you could write it as

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.590
T plus 1 given T, but then I gotta
write all these T plus 1s, all right?

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.870
And what you see here is
a bunch of independent

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.840
normal distributed variables, right?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.370
So, what this says is that the x value
is just normally distributed about

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.560
the old x value, with some standard,
with some variance, sigma squared x.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.560
Same thing with the y.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.520
Same thing with the theta.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.790
Same thing with the scale.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.720
So this is a similarity transform.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.450
What is says,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.890
is nothing about how I move an X tells
me anything about how I moved a Y.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.959
That's pure Brownian motion.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.910
So that can be illustrated like this,
right?

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.850
So here's Lt, this is where I think
the thing was at anytime t and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.920
what this Brownian motion says well Lt
plus 1, maybe I'm right near by, maybe

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.930
I'm at the same place but, oriented
differently, maybe I'm over here,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.750
maybe I'm over there, maybe I'm
over there, maybe I'm over here.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.780
With a likelihood of being
in any of those locations

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.840
depends upon how far I've moved.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.480
That's what these things here say.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.150
Okay.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.420
So in other words, moving further away
from my old Y gets less and less likely.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.180
What you can do is you can imagine
distributing a whole bunch of

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.100
possibilities, and that's what's
illustrated here is Lt plus 1.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.223
And, the idea is that the farther Lt
plus 1 is from L, from Lt, in terms of

00:01:48.223 --> 00:01:53.530
x, y, theta and scale or any of the
other variables, the less likely it is.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.340
So that's our dynamics model.
