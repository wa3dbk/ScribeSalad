Starting with the red box up at the top,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.689
we want our names to be as prominent as possible.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.210
Looking at featured work here, it's important to note that despite the fact it

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.720
doesn't quite look as prominent as the titles of our projects,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.900
it is organizing our projects, making it more important.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.630
So let's put featured work in an H2 tag.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.180
Coming to the project titles at the bottom of the portfolio, they're not as

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.290
important as featured work or the name at the top, so let's make them H3 tags.
