00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.735
So, what does this little
machine look like?

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:06.689
Remember, we're doing this to help R and
Ns memorize things better.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.780
So let's forget about neural
networks for just a moment.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.640
Imagine that you want
a system to have memory.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.440
You need to do three things.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.640
First, you need to write
the data into the memory.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.430
Then you will be able to read it back,
and

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.080
then you also want to be
able to erase it, or forget.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.030
Here is one way to write this
very same idea down as a diagram.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.410
You have a memory,
which is maybe a matrix of values.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.027
You also have inputs coming into
the memory, and a little instruction

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:43.556
gate that tells whether you are going
to write to that memory or not.

00:00:43.556 --> 00:00:46.330
You also have another gate that's

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.424
says whether you are going to able
to read from that memory or not.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:55.890
And then you have one final gate that
says forget the data or write it back.
