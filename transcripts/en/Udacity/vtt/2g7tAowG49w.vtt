In cycle 15, none of the results is broadcast.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.420
But we will be looking at this instruction to commit it and we can commit it. So

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.890
we will update our processor accordingly. Three goes in R3. The mapping for

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.800
R3, we check if it's ROB3, yes it is. We make the RAT point do this three,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.060
and we can free this Rob end. The final question of the quiz

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.340
is when does the last instruction commit. So, what will be in this entry here
