00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.780
Let's go through these one by one to see what the problem with each of them is.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.824
Remember, we're going for this form right here. For 0.5 times 10 to the 3rd,

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:12.870
the first number here, which is a, is not between 1 and 10, so that is our

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.982
problem. The base is 10 and b is an integer. For 6 times 10 to the 6.5, b is

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:25.933
not an integer since it's 6.5. In 4 times 2 to the 6th, the base of our

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:32.560
exponential part of our expression is 2, not 10, so that is our problem. Next,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.850
we have 325 times 10 to the negative 7. Once again, the issue is with a. 325 is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.188
definitely greater than 10. And finally, 1.2 times 100 to the 4th. Again, we

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:50.551
have a value of the base that is not 10, 100 is not equal to 10.
