00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.029
The package would cost $56.25. Great work if you found that price. This price

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.428
also makes sense, since our package weighs more and it's longer in length. So it

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:15.965
should definitely cost more than $20 to ship. We want to start by setting up a

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:21.342
proportion that has direct variation. The cost varies directly with the length.

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:25.170
And the cost varies directly with the weight. The next thing that we want to do

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.203
is make a list of the things we know. We know the first cost was $20.00, the

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:33.950
length was four feet, and it measured 10 pounds. Next we fill in the proportion

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.126
with the remaining pieces. The second cost, the second length, and the second

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:42.220
weight of the package. We make a list of those amounts as well. We're looking

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.880
for the cost of our package, so that's going to be x. The length of that package

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.462
is seven and a half feet. And the weight of that package is 15 pounds. Now we're

00:00:50.462 --> 00:00:54.760
ready to fill in our proportion. Plugging in these amounts into our proportion,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.550
we get this equation. I'm going to clean up the right hand side of my equation

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.316
first. Four times ten is 40. And 7.5 times 15 is 112.5. So I've written this

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:10.782
cleaned up part over here. Next we cross multiply to get 2,250 equals 40x and

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:15.743
finally we divide both sides by 40 to get our final answer.
