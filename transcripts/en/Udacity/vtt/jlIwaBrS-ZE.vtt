00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.120
Okay, so let's start getting our hands
dirty in creating our customer facing

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.400
marketing materials.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.930
Step one is to create our landing page.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.540
&gt;From a marketing perspective,
a landing page is a stand

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.370
alone web page that in the beginning
can serve as our website.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.580
It has a specific objective and
usually limited options for visitors.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.246
In the early stages of your business,

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:23.225
you might want to use just a landing
page rather than a full website.

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:26.516
To generate interest in your product and
to collect contact information from

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:30.250
potential users before you put
a lot of effort in a full website.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.580
This is when we really get to
figure out and test our messaging.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.730
We can track the reaction and behavior
of people to our messaging, sometimes by

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.620
having two or three different
versions and running an A/B test.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.420
We'll talk more about A/B
testing in lesson five.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.521
One of the cool things about your
landing page is that it can help

00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:46.698
you validate your idea.

00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:49.280
You can build out links
to potential features.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.480
And depending on the number
of clicks it gets,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.380
you can decide if that feature is worth
investing resources and developing.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.370
On aBARKment,
if we added a link to cat sitting and

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.890
no one clicked on it, we would know
not to build out this feature.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.780
Given that we are a startup
with a limited team and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.870
budget, this method
can be game changing.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.770
Some startups would prefer to launch
their landing page before their

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.280
product is even viable.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.530
So they can measure traffic or

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.920
start collecting email
addresses of interested users.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.340
Once you have a basic product or
MVP, minimum viable product,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.390
you can use your landing
page to measure conversions.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.910
There are nice free tools out there to
simply build your own landing page.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.970
We used InVision.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.280
For a refresher of how to use InVision,
go back to our prototyping course.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.180
When thinking about
creating your landing page,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.530
you should answer a few questions for
your customers.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.390
Let's cover those now.
