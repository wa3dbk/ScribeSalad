We'll finish this lesson by talking about Correlation and Causation. We briefly

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:08.746
discussed this in lesson one with the Golden Arches theory of conflict

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:13.484
resolution which has since been disproven. But still, it's kind of funny to

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:18.580
think that McDonalds might cause world peace. We found this really cute cartoon

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.530
online the link is at the bottom it's a little joke that illustrates the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.079
difference between correlation and causation. But we're leaving out the last

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.394
line because that's the punchline. First we're going to discuss correlation vs

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:35.906
causation. Causation means that one variable caused another to happen. For

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:39.812
example, the fact that it was raining caused a bunch of people to bring their

00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:46.104
umbrellas to work. But correlation just means that there's a relationship. For

00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:50.558
example, do happy people have more friends? Is it just because they're happy

00:00:50.558 --> 00:00:54.876
that they have more friends? Or, does them being happy cause them to act a

00:00:54.876 --> 00:01:00.412
certain way which then causes them to have more friends? We never know, there

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:05.093
are always lurking variables. We might have two variables X and Y, and they

00:01:05.093 --> 00:01:09.578
have a relationship, but only because both of them are influenced by variable

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:17.626
A. Or maybe, X influences Y through variable A. A is called a mediating

00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:22.082
variable. By just looking at scatter plots and the correlation, we don't know

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:28.455
what the case is. We can just see some kind of relationship. In order to make

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:32.609
causal statements, for one thing, the independent variable would have to occur

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.453
before the dependant variable and we have to be able to rule out any lurking

00:01:36.453 --> 00:01:43.590
variables. With age and pets, this one's kind of easy because we know that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.640
having more pets doesn't cause you to age. But others, like happiness and

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.232
number of friends are kind of ambiguous. Maybe having more friends causes you

00:01:55.232 --> 00:02:00.039
to be happy or maybe being happy causes you to have more friends. We don't

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.577
know. Even if one comes before the other, this doesn't necessarily mean that

00:02:04.577 --> 00:02:09.259
the first variable caused the second. I'm sure you can think of all sorts of

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.540
examples where that wouldn't be true.
