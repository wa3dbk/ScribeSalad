A common method of simplifying a mesh is the edge collapse, where one vertex is

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:08.428
moved along an edge to be at the same location as another vertex. If I move

00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:11.722
vertex A to be at the same location as vertex B, I can then get rid of vertex A

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:16.836
in memory and store just vertex B. This saves me from storing one vertex but

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:21.190
there are other benefits. If I'm drawing a wire frame, I'll draw fewer edges.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.388
If I'm drawing triangles, I'll need to save fewer faces. The question to you

00:00:24.388 --> 00:00:28.150
is, how many fewer edges and faces are drawn when you do an edge collapse?
