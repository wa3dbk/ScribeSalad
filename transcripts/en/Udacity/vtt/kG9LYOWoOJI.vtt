00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.310
Now, consider another sentence that we have come across earlier.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.910
If an animal lays eggs, and it flies, then it is a bird. How do

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.181
we write this in the language of logic, given that there is conjunction here. So

00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:15.060
this time, we can have two predicates again. There is a predicate of lays-eggs,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.680
coming from here. The predicate of flies, coming from here. And

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.690
we can denote a conjunction between them. Which in the language of logic is

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.830
often put in this form. Now we can re-write this sentence in the following form.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.920
If the animals lays eggs and the animal flies, then the animal is a bird.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.310
Remember again, this semi colon here, really is denoting implication for

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.040
now. Remember again, that in logic, this really stands for an implication.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.210
Consider the slightly different sentence. Suppose if the sentence was if

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.460
an animal lays eggs or it flies it is a bird. In that case, again,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.480
we'll have two predicates, but this time we'll have a disjunction between them.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.530
And the sentence would become or if animal lays eggs or animal flies,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.010
then the animal is a bird. And again, this is an implication. Let us continue

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.560
with the our exercise in which we are learning how to write sentencable language

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.060
of logic. It is under the sentence, if an animal flies and is not a bird.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.970
So, it is a negation here, then it is a bat. How do we write that in logic? So

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.770
I'm still interested in writing the antecedent of this particular sentence, and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.810
I may be able to say that animal flies is a conjunction here,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.080
because it is an and here, and we have this negation symbol for this predicate,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.930
bird. Now we can write a complete sentence by saying that the animal flies,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.190
conjunction. Animal is not a bird, implies animal is a bat.
