00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.960
Status code is 302, and the

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.408
location header was this URL. Iana.org/domain/example.

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:13.160
Okay, I'll work through how I find the answers and hopefully you

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.408
did something similar. So we go to our terminal and we said example.com. So

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:25.270
let's make that request, telnet to www.example.com. Port 80. Okay.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.248
Now we say GET / HTTP/1.0. HOST,

00:00:31.248 --> 00:00:36.170
www.example.com.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.100
Uh-huh. Nice simple response. We can see our status code is 302. And we

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.880
can see our location header is right here, iana.org.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.520
If that didn't work, you know, here's how you do it. All right, so let's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.300
let's play around a little bit more. So we

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.660
see that this is a redirect sponse, response because

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.910
of status code 302 and it's saying the actual

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.460
content is here. Let's give a shot at making

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.808
the request to find this. We're going telnet to

00:01:04.808 --> 00:01:07.924
iana.org and make a request for this path and

00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:10.140
see how it goes. See if we can get

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.578
a 200. We make the request to iana.org. Telnet to

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:20.300
www.iana.org port 80 and then we say get

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.544
slash. Domain slash example http slash 1.0.

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:30.414
Okay so here we are. You can see where I telnetted

00:01:30.414 --> 00:01:35.730
into Iana.org and you can see the request I made for

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.875
slash domain slash example. I used http 1.0 again. And you can see the response.

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:42.990
[LAUGH] This is actually kind of funny. So we

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.290
respond it with HTTP/1.1 status 200. This is actually a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.000
good example of, you know, the web not aligning up

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.830
exactly correctly but that's how it goes. Generally, this 1.1

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.220
should have mashed this 1.0 but since these guys control

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.430
the web, I guess they can do whatever they like.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.590
Okay, so you can see the common headers, dates You

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.980
know, today [LAUGH] actually today for me and the past

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.070
for you. You can see the server header, Apache

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.180
and you see it. This is an interesting how they're

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.890
last modified. This page was last modified over a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.110
year ago. This is for caching purposes. This tells our

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.940
browser that we don't need to bother requesting this

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.010
page again, you know? We don't need new updates if

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.760
it hasn't changed since this date. Content type. This is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.600
typical. Text HTML. And, below that, you see the content.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.360
Pretty cool huh?
