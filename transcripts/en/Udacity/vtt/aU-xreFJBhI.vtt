And it's 1 and 1. So, the way I get these numbers, 1 and 1, is really easy.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I just write down that y is always larger than x by 1.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When you look at this, that just means a = 1 and b = 1,

00:00:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
because you can think over this 1x instead of just x over here, and this gives us b equals 1.
