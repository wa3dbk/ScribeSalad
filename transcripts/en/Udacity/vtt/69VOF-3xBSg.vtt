00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:03.479
And the answer is 14 messages. And the first message

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.391
Alice is essentially telling onion router 1 to tell onion router 2

00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:10.583
to extend onion router 3. Then onion router 1 tells

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:13.299
onion router 2 to extend onion router 3.

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.765
And the third message onion router 2 tells onion router 3

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:21.729
to create a circuit. Onion router 3 responds onion router 2

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:25.314
saying I’ve created it. Onion router 2 responds back to

00:00:25.314 --> 00:00:29.750
onion router 1 saying I’ve extended. And onion router 1

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.238
responds back to Alice saying that I’ve extended.

00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:36.563
To then extend on to onion router 4, there will be two new

00:00:36.563 --> 00:00:39.745
messages between onion router 3 and onion router 4.

00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:42.649
So takes six messages to extend to onion router 3 and eight

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.649
more messages to extend onion router 4 to get 14.
