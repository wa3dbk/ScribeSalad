00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So we covered a lot of material in the customer segment part of the business model canvas.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We talked about the jobs to be done. We talked about pains. We talked about gains.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We talked about multi-sided markets, and we've closed with market type.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let me give you an example of a couple of startups who actually went

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and tried to define our customer segments.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So here was one.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The startup was actually trying to understand how to find foreign students at universities,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and so they were putting together their archetype and this was just the definition of meet the student

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and here's who they are and here's their family and oh this is their first time in America.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And because it was about providing financial services to foreign students,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
they actually understood something about their credit score, about social security number,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
US address, whether they were responsible academically and financially,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and whether their social network was responsible.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Another example of a customer segment was someone making new kite boarding equipment.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Who were their customers? Professional kite surfers.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They're solely concerned with performance. But they had another segment. Average kite surfers.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And they had a third, prospective kite surfers, and though I don't think they were this young

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
they were actually trying to understand how to segment their market

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and what their specific performance needs for kite surfs were in each segment.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The other thing that we're interested in doing if you remember in customer segments is

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
understanding a day in the life of a customer.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now sometimes this could actually be diagrammed as to how do they spend their time.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And this happens to be how does a designer spend their time

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
putting together an architectural product.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So how much they spend in phase 1 and then in prototyping and manufacturing and final product,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and so this was giving them a view of what it would look like and so they can now describe to me

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and others, "Oh! And our product fits right here and here's why," etc.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Here was another example of someone trying to understand the customer problem

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of couples who happen to be on separate coasts or long distance from each other.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And they were trying to understand what the problems were and so they were able to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
articulate all the key pieces and kind of rank them by priority.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And I thought that this was a great way to kind of diagram the problem.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Here was another example of a team putting together a detailed archetype

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of a set of customers.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
They gave their archetype a name, Pat the Professional.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Specified who Pat was, upwardly mobile professional, salaries, what they did,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
how much they spend, what their demographics are, what their traits were,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
what their motivations were, how many were there, where they worked, where they bought, etc.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I thought this was a great example of a professional class consumer

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
who was shopping frequently online.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Another example, in medical devices, trying to understand two segments,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
oncologists and pathologists, here's what they did, here's what they cared about,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and more importantly here's how they're paid.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Here's how they're paid in the hospital and here's how they got reimbursed.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Here's another example of a mammography product,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
how patient care works inside of a hospital and how people got reimbursed.

00:03:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So you could find these examples and more on the link below.
