00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.354
When we have a less than inequality, we perform the same steps. f could be less

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:08.439
than positive 5, or f could be greater than negative 5. Remember, for the

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:12.912
negative answer, we reverse the inequality sign. And here's what's interesting.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.826
The greater-than symbol creates a union, or two separate regions, where the less

00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:22.080
than sign creates an intersection between two points. With just the flip of a

00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:26.235
sign, we can exclude entire numbers or include a small region. And let's look

00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:30.320
more closely right here at these 2. We said we get an intersection, so that

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:34.655
means f is between these 2 numbers. Let's rewrite these inequalities. Now that

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.520
I've switched the spot of these 2 inequalities, I'm going to reverse the

00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:42.900
direction of this inequality. I've switched this inequality around, so negative

00:00:42.912 --> 00:00:47.042
5 is less than f. This is still the same as F being greater than negative 5.

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:51.448
Notice the f's are in the middle now. The f's are between my 2 numbers. We can

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.568
even write this as one inequality, and, in fact when you solve any absolute

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.911
value inequality with a less than symbol you can write it as one inequality with

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:01.462
3 parts. Pretty impressive.
