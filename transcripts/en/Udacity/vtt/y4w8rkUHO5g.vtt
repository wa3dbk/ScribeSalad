00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.480
Now let's talk about
an alternative model for

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.010
structuring server applications
that perform concurrent processing.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.230
The model we'll talk about is
called event-driven model.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.840
An event-driven application can
be characterized as follows.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.506
The application is implemented
in a single address space,

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:20.156
there is basically
only a single process.

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:22.780
And a single thread of control.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.610
Here is the illustration
of this model and

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.920
this is taken from the read
pies flash paper as well.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.380
The main part of the process is
the event dispatcher that continuously

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.630
in a loop looks for incoming events and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.000
then based on those events invokes one
or more of the registered handlers.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.490
Here events correspond to
some of the following things.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.440
We see that the request
from the client browsers,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.510
that message that's received from
the network, that's an event.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.220
Completion of the send, so once the
server responds to the client request,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.060
the fact that the send completed,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.070
that's another event,
as far as the system is concerned.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.569
Completion of a disk read operation.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.810
That's another event that the system
will need to know how to handle.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.729
The dispatcher has the ability to accept
any of these types of notifications,

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.513
and then based on the notification type
to invoke the appropriate handler.

00:01:18.513 --> 00:01:21.750
So in that sense, it operates
very much like a state machine.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.981
Since we're talking about
a single credit process,

00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:29.788
invoking a handler simply means that we
will jump to the appropriate location in

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:34.220
the processes address space where
the handler is implemented.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.000
At that point the handler
execution can start.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.421
For instance, if the process is notified
that there is a pending connection

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.838
request on the network
port that it uses,

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:48.000
the dispatcher will pass that event
to the accept connection handler.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.911
If the event is a receipt
of a data of message on

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.365
an already established connection,

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:57.902
then the event dispatcher will pass
that to the read request handler.

00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:02.258
Once the filename is extracted from the
request and it's confirmed that the file

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:05.410
is present, the process will
send out chunks of the file.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.300
And then once there is a confirmation
that that chunk of the file portion of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.720
the file has been successfully sent and
it will continue

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.510
iterating over the handler that's
dealing with the send operation.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.763
If the file is not there,

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.707
then some sort of error message
will be sent to the client.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:26.313
So whenever an event occurs the handlers
are the sequence of code that executes

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.076
in response to these events.

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:31.470
The key feature of the handlers
is that they run to completion.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.310
If a handler needs to
perform a blocking operation,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.920
it will initiate the blocking operation
and then it will immediately pass

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.120
control back to the event dispatcher,
so it will no longer be in the handler.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.530
At that point, the dispatcher is
free to service other events or

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.570
call other handlers.
