00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hmmm--it turns out the answer we're looking for is -8.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And here's how to see it:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If Subtraction is Left Associative,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
then we want to put as many of these parentheses

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as far to the left as possible.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So we're going to do (1 - 2) first, and then subtract 3--and then subtract 4.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So (1 - 2) is -1.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(-1 - 3) is -4.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
(-4 - 4) is -8.

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And that's the answer we got.
