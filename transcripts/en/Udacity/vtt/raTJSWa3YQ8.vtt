00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.217
This can happen in a cross
site scripting attack.

00:00:03.217 --> 00:00:04.680
Here's an example.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.998
The user has logged into
a vulnerable site, naive.com.

00:00:08.998 --> 00:00:13.340
And his browser now stores
the cookie from naive.com.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.165
The user is then phished and
clicks a URL to visit evil.com.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:23.850
Evil.com returns a page that has
a hidden frame that forces the browser

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.930
to visit naive.com and
invoke hello.cgi web application

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.910
on naive.com with a malicious
script as the name of the user.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.700
When the user's browser displays
the HTML page from evil.com,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.284
he will be forced to visit naive.com and

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:46.528
call hello.cgi with this malicious
script as the user's name.

00:00:46.528 --> 00:00:51.760
Hello.cgi at naive.com then
echoes the malicious script

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.810
in the HTML page that is sent
back to the user's browser.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.400
The user's browser displays the HTML
page and executes the malicious script.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.420
The result is that the cookie
to naive.com is stolen and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.880
sent to the attacker.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.721
You may ask, so what?

00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.340
If evil.com gets
the cookie to naive.com?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.265
Because that cookie can include
session authentication information for

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:17.410
naive.com.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.190
Therefore, by stealing the cookie the
attacker can now impersonate the user.
