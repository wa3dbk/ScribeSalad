00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Your first task was to fill in the rest of the code of this for loop down here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So the first thing that we changed is the wood density.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The new wood density is going to be equal to the old wood density

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
minus the time step times the burn rate.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Since remember the burn rate is really just the time derivative of the wood density.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now for the change in temperature. Of course, we start with the initial temperature.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And then we add to it h times a bunch of stuff.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now all of this code is just taking into account those four factors that we were saying

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
influenced the change in temperature.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So the first thing we have right here you can see is a 2D heat equation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And this is actually implemented using the finite difference scheme.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
After this, we also take into account heat loss and then the wind and then also the combustion.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now going up to the top of our wildfire function,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
let's talk about this initial distribution of wood density.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This first line right here is just a translation of that mathematical expression

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I had written out for you.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The y intercept of the point that we're considering is just equal to some y value

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
minus the slope that we're given times x and actually this xy

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is the xy that we're talking about at this moment.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That means that the wood density then is equal to wood value 1.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Well, a bunch of typos. Well that's a problem. Let's fix that right now.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
See everyone makes mistakes. This should be wood 2. This should be wood 1.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay now that all of that is fixed we have the wood density at our point xy

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is equal to wood 1 the maximum possible wood density plus all of this.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This is the difference between wood 2 and wood 1.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's that range in which w is allowed to vary

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
across the terrain divided by the difference between intercepts.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So you remember on the graph that I showed you earlier.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This graph right here actually.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That is the slope of this line since wood density here is on the y axis

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and the intercept is actually on the x axis.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If we take the difference in wood density divided by the difference in intercept

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we get the slope of this pink line right here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So now you can see that we have the slope of that pink line times the intercept of the line

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
up to the point we're considering is on minus intercept 1.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So this is really just using point slope form to calculate w.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Remember, we only want w to range between wood 1 and wood 2.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So this line restricts it to that range. Now let's look at the plot we get.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So finally a graph of our forest.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In both images, we're looking at the xy square of terrain that we've been talking about.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Here we're graphing the temperature shown by these different colors,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and here we're graphing the density of wood.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now unfortunately this is only a 50 x 50 pixel image.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If we wanted to see what's happening with much better resolution, we should use 200 x 200.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Unfortunately my computer is not cooperating so we're going to have to settle

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
for this less perfect image.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Even though this isn't really a perfect picture,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
you can still tell that the wood has been depleted in the center.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The density of wood is very low right here compared to the rest of the area

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
where the fire hasn't spread yet.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You can also see that as we wanted the density of the wood does vary along lines like this.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
In the 200 x 200 image, you would be able to see that the wood had been

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
very depleted in the center and that the fire had marched out the rim of this area.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We can kind of tell that there is sort of a red circle around here.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
However, we'd be able to better that the fire is moving slower,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and it's less hot in the area where there's less wood.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The spreading the fire is way to slow on this image and one reason for that is that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the heat is averaged over larger pixels so actually not lowering the temperature

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
reached the temperature of ignition in a lot of places.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I hope you found talking about wildfires as exciting as I have.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Awesome job on this problem and throughout the entire course.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I hope you're excited for the final exam.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I think it'll give you a great look at a ton of different examples

00:03:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
not just from the material we've learned about but also from some new kinds of applications.
