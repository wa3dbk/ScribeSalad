00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.230
So, we now have a token
based authentication system

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.140
that will authenticate a user based on
their user name and password or a token.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.230
But if we were going to actually store
passwords, users will be forced to make

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.870
accounts and remember another
password in order to use our API.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.530
In a real application,
we would need to implement some sort of

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.230
account verification and
password recovery for

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.250
our application, since users can
often forget their passwords.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.730
And users would need to fill out another
profile and probably upload another

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.470
profile picture, adding more delay time
for the user to access our application

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.360
and potentially introducing a place for
a loss in user retention.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.100
If we add OAuth 2.0 to our application,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.040
we can let users log in with their
existing accounts, like Google and

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.480
Facebook, and
quickly gain access to our application.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.160
In this next video, I will show you how
to add an endpoint using Google signin

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.030
that will allow users to log in with
their existing Google accounts.
