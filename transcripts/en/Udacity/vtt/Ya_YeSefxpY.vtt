00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.780
This circle will have a radius of 2 and a center at the point negative 3, 1.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.916
Great work if you found those two. Now if you struggled with this, I recommend

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:14.638
going back to looking at completing the square. You'll need this as a helpful

00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:19.677
tool for the many of the types of problems, you'll encounter later. We want to

00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:24.552
start by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation. So we'll have negative

00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:28.700
6 on the right, and then we'll have our x squared term and 6x on the left, and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.841
our y squared term and negative 2y, also on the left. I'm moving my constant

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:38.668
term to the right. And I'm regrouping the x terms together, and the y terms

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:42.756
together. We'll add 9 to our x terms, and we'll add that to both sides of our

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:51.233
equation. We add 9 since b over 2 squared equals 9. B is 6. We divide it by 2

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:55.776
which equals 3 and we square it to get 9. To complete the square for the y

00:00:55.776 --> 00:01:00.842
terms. We'll add 1 to both sides of the equation. The b here is negative 2. So

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:05.434
negative 2 divided by 2 equals negative 1. And then we'll square it, which

00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:09.933
equals positive 1. So these terms terms can be written as the perfect square of

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:15.800
x plus 3 squared. And these three terms could be written as the perfect square

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.860
of y minus 1 squared. And then on the right hand side, we simply add these

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.355
constants together to get a total of 4. Now our equation is in a form we

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:32.040
recognize. We have h, which is negative 3. And we have k, which is positive 1.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.763
And then our radius is simply the square root of this number, it's 2.
