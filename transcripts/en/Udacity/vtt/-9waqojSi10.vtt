00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let me give you a data set. x=3, 4, 5 and for those x's we get 7, 8, and 9.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The first data item would be 3, 7. Second 4, 8. Third 5, 9.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's easy to see that the mean x-bar is 4, mean y-bar is 8

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and this gives us x - x-bar and y - y-bar, the new numbers -1, 0, 1 and -1, 0, 1 here again.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So these are three mean and normalized data points.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's now compute these three values over here for this example. Give me the first one.
