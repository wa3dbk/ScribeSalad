00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We looked a couple common coverage metrics that come up in practice.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, we've looked at statement coverage, which is close relative to line coverage.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We looked at branch coverage, also called decision coverage,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and for most of you out there, these are the coverage metrics that are going to matter for everyday life.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, as I said before, there are many other coverage metrics, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we're going to just look at a few of them.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The reason these are interesting is not because we're going to go out and obsessively

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
get 100% coverage on our code on all these metrics.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But rather because they form part of the answer to the question

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
how shall we come up with good test inputs in order to effectively find bugs in our software?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Loop coverage is very easy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It simply specifies that we execute each loop 0 times, once, and more than once.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The insight here is that loop boundary conditions are an extremely frequent source 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of bugs in real codes.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For example, if we had this loop in our Python code,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so for a line in open file--that is to say we want to read every line from the file

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and then process it--to get full loop coverage we would need to test this code

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
using a file that contains no lines, using a file that contains just one line,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and using a file that contains multiple lines.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, let's look at a fairly heavy-weight coverage metric called modified condition decision coverage or MC/DC.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If that seems like kind of a big mouthful, there's a reason for that,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which is that MC/DC coverage is required for certain kinds of avionics software.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That is, if you're going to write safety critical software, where if the software fails,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
airplanes can fall out of the sky, then one of the things you'll need to do to show

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that you're software is correct is get a high-degree of MD/DC coverage.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's designed to be pretty rigorous but still without blowing up into an exponential number of tests.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
MC/DC coverage basically starts off with a branch coverage, 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so I'm going to simplify here a little bit, but MC/DC coverage basically starts off with branch coverage.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It additionally states that every condition involved in a decision takes on every possible outcome.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Conditions are simply boolean-valued variables found in tests,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and decisions are just the kind of tests that we see in an if statement or a while loop,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
or something like that.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Finally, every condition used in a decision independently affects its outcome.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So, that's kind of a mouthful. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This is going to be hard to grasp unless we go through an example, so let's do that.
