00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.900
Okay, so now we're going to answer the question. So if we want

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.520
to consider all these inputs, and run them all on the software,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.490
let's see how it will work. Let's assume that these are, 32

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.280
bit integers. So at this point what we will have is, a

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.130
number of combination, which is 2 to the 32, times 2 to

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.390
the 32. They're two integers. This is equal to 2 to the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.910
64, which in turn, is more or less equal, to 10 to

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.110
the 19. So 10 to the 19 is the number of tests that

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.960
we need to run to cover the whole domain. Now let's assume

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.400
that we can run one test per nanosecond. So what that means

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.290
is that we can run 10 to the 9 tests per second,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.240
and that's a lot. If we do the math, that results in 10

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.750
to the 10 seconds over all, because we have 10 to the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.760
19 tests, we could run 10 to the 9 tests per second

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.630
so, we do the math, and we can run all these tests

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.340
in 10 to the 10 seconds. And what that corresponds to, it's about

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.470
600 years, so a lot of time. So even for such

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.710
a simple problem, a problem that takes two integers and adds them,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.990
it will take more than 500 years to test it exhaustively. So

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.690
the bottom line here is that we just can't do exhaustive testing.
