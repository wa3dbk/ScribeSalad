00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The best answer is that it does not provide any authentication.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It does establish a shared key,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but it's a shared key with some unknown entity.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's may be really providing no benefit,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but I would say that at least establishing the shared key means

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
now you've got a channel with some entity that's encrypted,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and if someone is eavesdropping on that channel--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you're only worried about a passive adversary--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
they might be able to eavesdrop on that channel, but you do have a secure key established.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You don't know that it's with the right server.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If you there's an active adversary, this definitely provides no benefit,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
because the active adversary can do the attack in the middle,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
impersonate the server, establish the key,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and that's the one who has the shared key instead of the server that you intend to talk to.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If it's a passive adversary, that assumes the message actually does get to the right place,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so it provides some security against the passive adversary,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
who can't intercept or inject new messages.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It allows you to establish that key, but doesn't provide any authentication.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I think the 3rd answer is the best.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
One could make arguments for either the 2nd or the 4th.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Don't be upset if you had good arguments for those,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and I should emphasize that this establishes a secured shared key

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
only against a passive adversary even without worrying about the authentication

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
since an active adversary can interfere with the key that is established.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
For this protocol to provide a meaningful benefit,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
it's necessary that the client actually knows this KUs value or has a way to check it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
before accepting that this is the server that she intends to talk with.
