00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.460
In this lesson we're going to be
talking about SWIFT collections,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.050
which include arrays,
dictionaries, and sets.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.510
Just as a quick refresher,
an array is an ordered list of items,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.200
a dictionary is a collection
of key value pairs, and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.790
a set is an unordered
list of distinct values.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.250
Of the three, arrays are the only
collection that has a defined order.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.230
And also the only one that
may have repeated values.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.270
As an iOS developer you're sure to use
arrays in dictionaries on a daily basis.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.240
You're undoubtedly already familiar
with these data structures, but

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.920
it will pay to really internalize
their Swift implementations.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.480
For example,
when we get to the networking course

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.740
you'll be using dictionaries
a lot in parsing JSON.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.400
We'll also briefly talk about sets.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.070
For this module you'll want to
open up the Playground file and

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.390
titled Lesson3_Collections.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.030
Let's start with arrays.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.370
Arrays can be initialized in three ways.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.500
Here's the first option.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.900
By now you've seen these
parentheses a few times.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.220
They represent a call
to a constructor and

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.390
init method where the word
init has been omitted.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.570
Here I've typed array to specify the
type of the object we're initializing.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.220
Just like you saw earlier with the light
switch class, with collections we

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.900
also need to specify the type of
the item that the collection holds.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.400
So we type double here in
between angle brackets.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.030
And in the end the statement will
initialize an empty array of doubles.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.930
You actual will rarely see
that first option used.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.940
More often you'll see shorthand
that looks like this.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.190
Again, I'm initializing an empty array.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.860
The square brackets let the compiler
know that it's an array, so

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.120
I don't need to type out array anymore.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.900
And then I indicate the type,
double, between square brackets.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.190
Like before, the parentheses at
the end signify the constructor.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.010
And then I can add items to my
more numbers array, like this.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.710
The third and most concise option for

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.050
initialization is to use
array literal syntax.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.840
Here I just create a list of the
contained items, separated by commas and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.480
enclose them in square brackets.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.790
The same way I did to add
items to the previous array.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.360
This array also holds
items of type double.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.780
But as we've seen before the arrays
type can be inferred by the compiler.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.710
It's super easy to combine these
two arrays by concatenating them

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.240
with the plus operator.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.100
Or to be even more concise I can use
the compound assignment operator.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.890
Notice that the compiler doesn't allow
me to add values to an array that's been

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.500
defined as a constant using LET.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.510
If I've defined an array as a constant I
need to define a new constant in order

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.660
to concatenate the two.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.370
An array can hold any type of object,
including custom classes.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.140
For example,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.610
here I'll define an array called circuit
which holds objects of type LightSwitch.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.260
And then I'll add some light switches I
want the circuit array to keep track of.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.184
Or I could just define the array's
components from the get-go.
