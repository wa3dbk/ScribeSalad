00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.390
The first way I'm going to try to do this is to start with the coordinates of

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:08.765
this point. So, I have this y value, 10 minus the y value of this point, which

00:00:08.777 --> 00:00:13.255
is 2, and I divide that by the x value of the top point minus the x value of the

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:17.595
lower point. Simplifying, just gives me 2. Now, let's try starting with the

00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:22.674
coordinates from the lower point first. We'll take that y value, 2, and subtract

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:27.383
10, and switch the coordinates in the denominator as well. So, we have 3 minus

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:32.159
7. Now, instead of positive 8 over positive 4, we have negative 8 over negative

00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:36.790
4. But in the end, this reduces to the same answer of 2. So, we can see that it

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:41.127
doesn't matter which points coordinates we put first, as long as we're

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.832
consistent.
