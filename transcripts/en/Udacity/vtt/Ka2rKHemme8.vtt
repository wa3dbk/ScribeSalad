00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
Well, let's see and the answer is 8. So here what's happening. Python is looking for x and y.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.530
It finds y inside the local scope of add_nums.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.870
It doesn't find x inside that local scope so it moves up

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.370
into the globe of variables and it finds x there.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.190
It makes use of it--6 + 2 is 8.
