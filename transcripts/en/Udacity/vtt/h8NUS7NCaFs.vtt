00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.431
So now we know some ways to make comparisons.

00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:04.000
We want to use them to make decisions--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.231
to make our code do something different, depending on the result of a comparison.

00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:10.000
The way to do that is to use an "if " statement.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The structure of an "if" statement is:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we have the keyword, "if", followed by a comparison,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we'll call that the test expression,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
followed by a colon.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then, inside the "if", we have the block,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the block is the code that will run when the test expression is True.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If the test expression doesn't evaluate to True, then the block doesn't execute.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And, as was in the procedure definitions,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we know the end of the "if" because of the indentation.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All the statements inside the block

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
are executed only when the test expression is True.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The next statement that's not indented is going to be executed,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
whether or not the test expression is True.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So here's an example of a procedure that uses "if":

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We can define a procedure, "absolute".

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It takes 1 input, which is a number.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Inside the body of "absolute" we're going to use an "if" statement.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We'll use an "if" test, where we're testing if the value of "x" is less than zero.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So that's the test expression: we have the "if" followed by the test expression, "X &lt; 0".

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In the Block, we're going to have one statement

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which changes the value of "x" to be "-x".

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The next statement, which will happen after the "if",

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
whether the test was True or False,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
will return "x".

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So what this does is gives us the absolute value of the number that's passed in.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
If the number that's passed in is negative,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we take its opposite and we use its negation,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and then we return.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If the number is positive, this test will be False

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so we don't execute the block that changes

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the value of "x" to its negation.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We'll go right to the statement that returns "x".

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So now it's time for a quiz to see if you understand

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
how to use "if" and can use it to define a procedure.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Your goal for this quiz is to define a procedure called "bigger"

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that takes in 2 numbers as its inputs

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and it outputs the greater of the 2 inputs.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So here are a few examples:

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If the inputs are "2" and "7", the greater input is "7" and the output should be "7".

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If the inputs are "3" and "2", the greater input is "3" and so the output should be "3".

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If the two inputs are the same, say "3" and "3", the output should be "3".
