00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.800
Now that you've learned how
to make an engaging game,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.400
let's talk about the best
ways to make money with it.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.230
How do you build a profitable game?

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.730
&gt;&gt; The most obvious way is to
price a game, say, at $0.99.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.550
Then anyone who wants to play your
game has to pay to download it.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.290
These are called Premium games.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.530
&gt;&gt; I've seen a few games
like that in the App Store.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.220
But mostly I see free games.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.090
How to games that are free
to download make a profit?

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.520
&gt;&gt; Those are called Freemium games, and

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.250
they use a combo of ads and
in-app purchases to make money.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.470
&gt;&gt; And in this lesson, we'll learn
more about monetization strategies for

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.220
both Freemium and Premium games.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.660
&gt;&gt; We'll see what works and
what doesn't for

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.320
each model, and even show you how to
implement your ads In an Android game.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.100
&gt;&gt; After this lesson,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700
you'll be able to choose the best
ways to monetize your game.
