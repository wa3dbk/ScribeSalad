Once we understand the entities,

we can pick an appropriate
application structure.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.940
The main content that your app deals
in should be on the first screen and

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.940
it should offer navigation
to related actions.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.740
Let's take a look at Simple Note and
reverse engineer what the entities are.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.410
It's clear that the hero
of the app are the notes.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.590
And with a click or two,
you can see the other entity tags.
