00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.410
Way back in lesson two, we discussed
the difference between process and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.020
outcome measures using
hemoglobin A1c as the exemplar.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.630
The process measure is whether it
is done periodically according to

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.070
guidelines and its actual value is a
measure of the outcome of diabetes care.
