00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So coin 1 has a probability of heads equals P₁ and coin 2 has a probability of heads equals P₂

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and this might not be different probabilities.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In my programming environment, I can account this by making 2 arguments separated by a comma,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for example, 0.5 and 0.8, and then the function takes as an input, 2 arguments, P₁ and P₂,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and then I can use both of these variables in the return assignment.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let’s now flip both coins and write the code that computes the probability

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.265
that coin 1 equals heads and coin 2 equals heads for example of 0.5 and 0.8, this would be?
