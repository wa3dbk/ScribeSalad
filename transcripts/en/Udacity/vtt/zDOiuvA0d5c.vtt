00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.880
Something else that was
observed about moving lights.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.700
So I'm showing you this picture, and
you probably don't see very much.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.590
So you probably don't know what this is.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.980
To me it's obviously a horse
jumping over a fence.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.890
Except when I put it in motion, oh.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.950
It's Meghan strolling along.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.998
She has such a nice stroll.

00:00:17.998 --> 00:00:20.680
No it's not, it's just some set of
random dots from some other exhibit.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.443
Notice that that center point is fixed.

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:25.370
It's not moving at all.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.410
And, in fact, if I erase that and
look at that,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.150
and you just stare at that point,
the whole thing looks kind of weird.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.950
But then if you just stop
looking at that point and

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.130
just look at the whole thing,
you see somebody moving.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.670
Except now I can't get that weird
center point out of my head, all right?

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.020
But the idea is with this
very impoverished stimulus,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.770
you are able to perceive
not just motion.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.870
Remember, nothing is moving here, right?

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.318
There are no points
moving on the screen.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:55.310
Point, point, point.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.050
You see them moving.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.180
Not only do you see points moving,
you see a person moving.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.530
All there are are static
pictures of points.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.380
That's all that's there.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.960
The rest of what's going on is
being manufactured in your head.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.020
And our goal, because we're
computational vision people,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.710
is to think a little bit about how to
get the computer to manufacture some of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.470
that information.
