00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.310
So the super in supercomputing
is about solving big,

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.970
hairy computational problems
as efficiently as possible.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.276
And here at Georgia Tech, there are many
examples of scientists everyday

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.904
using supercomputers to do
all kinds of important stuff.

00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:16.165
Stuff like simulating
the dynamics of the earth, or

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:18.323
studying biomolecular systems.

00:00:18.323 --> 00:00:21.732
Or analyzing social networks,
or understanding the cosmos,

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:22.770
just to name a few.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.710
Now, these are incredibly
complex phenomena and

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.930
many scientists believe we won't
gain any insight into them without

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.220
some combination of your mathematical
models, leaner algorithms and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.670
data structures, more and accurate data,
as well as enough processing color.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.850
Now ours is a CS course
on super computing.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.580
So the main question we'll be interested
in is, given a computational problem and

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.240
a machine, how do you compute at
the absolute limits of scale and speed.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040
You'll encounter many such
limits throughout the course.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.280
But one of the more interesting ones,
come from physics.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.110
These are things like limits
based on the speed of light,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.410
all the amount of energy, power or
heat dissipated by the system.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.380
In fact that's the reason we're here
in this crazy mad scientist lab

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.860
run by my crazy mad scientist friend and
colleague Ken Brown.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.370
Ken Brown and

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.510
his crew are thinking about how to
build Quantum Computing Systems.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.160
That represents one of the ultimate
limits of physical computation.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.340
Now we won't actually talk about quantum
computing stuff in this class, but

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.350
I wanted to start there to sort
of stimulate your imagination,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.660
not only about the limits of
conventional computing systems but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.520
also about what might lie beyond.
