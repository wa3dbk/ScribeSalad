The cool thing about the way plus works in Python is, there's nothing really

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:07.882
special about it, it's just a short way of calling a magic method. What that

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:12.859
means is when you have an expression, a plus b, what's really going on here is

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.994
that you're calling a function and it's the function that you get by looking at

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:22.739
the type of a for the attribute_ <u>add</u> _. Which is function that takes two

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.050
inputs and, a and b are those inputs. So the only thing that's magic about plus

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.720
is that there's a special syntax that makes it easier to use. When you start

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.295
defining your own types, which we'll get to pretty soon, well you define a plus

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:38.215
operator for your own types. So what that means is that you can actually make

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:42.015
plus work for your own types by defining an add method. And, we're getting a

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.280
little ahead of ourselves, so we'll get to that later. But that's something to

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.452
look forward to that you'll be able to define your own types, and give plus

00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:50.153
whatever meaning you want, for them.
