00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.490
Now that we have looked at the data can we ask some more questions?

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.480
So the first question we want to ask is can we

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.960
identify people based on their location patterns?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.350
We have discussed in the previous video that we could use some distance

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.700
functions measured at different times to determine a person's location pattern.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.360
To answer this question, we can start using simply x and

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.740
y coordinates for their location.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.630
Or use something like a taxicab distance or a Euclidean distance.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.120
We have already discussed the formulas for the taxi cab and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.230
the Euclidean distances.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.920
As you see, we will continue using the flow diagrams to map our

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.670
progress through the iterative model building process.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.300
After looking at the data we can quickly draw the following

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.060
conclusions about it.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.420
First, the data is labeled.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.120
Secondly, the labels are categories and not numerical.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.980
So we can cast this as a classification problem.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.830
Of course, we can use location and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.770
distance over time to make this classification.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.510
The next thing we need to decide is whether we want to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.680
build a model that is linear or not.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.428
We can use some nonlinear methods.

00:01:22.428 --> 00:01:27.990
For example, kernels or artificial neural networks.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.910
However, for this problem we will not go down this route.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.040
We will go down the linear route first.
