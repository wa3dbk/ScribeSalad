So we just heard a little bit
about how to use headings

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.980
to improve the experience for
screen reader users.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.190
&gt;&gt; Right, pages with good headings
are so much easier for me to use.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.190
But there are other things I
use to navigate web pages.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.900
Voiceover and
other screen readers, for example,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.540
allow me to navigate by links,
by form controls, and landmarks
