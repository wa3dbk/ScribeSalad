00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.792
The quantity 2y minus 3z times the quantity 3x plus 4 is correct. Fantastic work

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:09.404
for getting that one right. Now, I know we haven't covered negative signs yet,

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:13.992
so don't worry if you didn't get it right. Let's see how we could do this. I can

00:00:13.992 --> 00:00:17.982
see that both this term and this term share a y, and also, they're both

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:22.452
divisible by 2. So, 2y must by my greatest common factor. If I divide 2y into

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:27.355
6xy, I'm left with 3x. And if I divide 2y into 8y, I'm left with positive 4.

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:32.092
Here, this term is negative and this term is negative. The negative 9 and

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:37.150
negative 12 share a negative 3 as a common factor. They also share a z. Now, I

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.489
want to think about what two terms should go in here. What number times negative

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.957
3z will give me negative 9xz? That must be positive 3x. Then, I think about what

00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:53.298
number times negative 3z will give me negative 12z. This must be positive 4. And

00:00:53.298 --> 00:00:58.484
this is great. This first term and the second term share a common factor of 3x

00:00:58.484 --> 00:01:03.771
plus 4, so we can factor again. So, this 3x plus 4 is here for one of my factors

00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:08.985
and 2y minus 3z is my other factor. And again, this line should make sense

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:14.385
because if we distribute 2y, we'll get 2y times 3x plus 4, our first term. And

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:19.953
then if we distribute negative 3z, we'll have negative 3z times 3x plus 4, our

00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:23.984
second term. So, this is our last finaled factored form.
