00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.120
We looked at these images in the last lecture.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.240
We started off with one image and then I also showed you another one.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.220
This one.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.660
In both of these images, the same two subjects just taken from

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.510
a different viewpoint and, of course, also different focal length.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.910
In this image, I'd basically taken the picture with a smaller focal length and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.530
here, of course, with a larger focal length.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.870
Basically, the two subjects were at different distances.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.630
The reason for us to look at these two images was because I'm interested in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.560
showing you that by changing the focal length, allows us to move back and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.220
still capture the same scene and by changing the viewpoint,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.440
we can change the perspective of the scene.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.060
For example, here, these two characters look pretty much sitting next to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.790
each other even though they are almost a meter and a half away.
