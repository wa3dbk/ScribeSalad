00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.832
The axis to stretch along is red. Which is the x axis. The one tricky bit is to

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:10.870
realize a Sphere of radius ten is actually 20 units across. If we want to go

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.747
from 20 to 60 units, the scale along the x axis needs to be multiplied by 3.

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:22.135
That is, 60 divided by 20 is 3. To go from 20 units to 4 units, the other two

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:27.424
axes must be multiplied by 0.2. For the rotation, we do as before, rotating

00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:32.503
around the y axis. 30 degrees corresponds to 1 hour of movement.
