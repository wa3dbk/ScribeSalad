One really cool thing about this course is that you're potentially taking it

with thousands of other students, and these students come from all over the

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:13.295
world. Well, maybe not from Antarctica. This is a really cool thing about

00:00:13.295 --> 00:00:16.815
education today, these massive open online courses that anyone can take for

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:22.460
free. Udacity students are super diverse. What if we want to know who takes

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.099
these classes? For now, let's just look at a sample of size 50. I'll give you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.186
four seconds to look at this table and tell me which country most students in

00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:33.140
this sample are from.
