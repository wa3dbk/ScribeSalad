00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.020
And the last thing to do from this aggregation here, is to return some object

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.710
which will then get stored in the final result returned from our rollup.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.870
And here, we simply returned the attendance, the x and the y,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.180
which correspond to the total, the center x and the center y that we computed.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.500
And again the last part of this, is to simply pass our

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.620
data using the .entries function through all of these transforms.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.169
We put a debugger right after all of the nest function,

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.735
we can then inspect both the input to the nest pipeline and the output.

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:39.810
Again, we can examine what data is, before we pass it through nest,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.571
in this case, all the rows of our attendance data,

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:47.348
which corresponds to an array of 836 elements.

00:00:47.348 --> 00:00:51.819
And if we examine what gets returned and store it in our nested array,

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.984
you can see that nested is an array of objects, of length 20, which happens to

00:00:56.984 --> 00:01:03.070
correspond to the total number of World Cups that have been held over the years.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.040
And if we inspect each nested Object, you can see here,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.970
that it has a key corresponding to what we defined in our Key Function, or

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.880
rather the year of the game, and it has a values Object which corresponds to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.628
what we returned from our rollup function.

00:01:20.628 --> 00:01:25.080
Which has the total attendance for the year, the x pixel coordinate and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.230
the y pixel coordinate.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.620
And while this may seem like a lot of data transformation work to be doing

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.270
in our JavaScript and in d3, if you understand these types of grouping and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.230
aggregates, it allows you to create very powerful interactive graphics,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.690
where the data you load might have to take on many different forms depending on

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.206
how your user interacts with your visualization.

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:52.900
But, enough data munching in the browser, let's get back to our map.
