00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.450
For loops are similar to while loops but check for

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.050
conditions in a slightly different way.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.310
We have an initialization value,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.620
a condition that gets checked on every iteration of the loop, and

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.980
a mutator that increments or decrements the initialization value.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.920
&gt;&gt; So for example, in this for loop, we initialize an incrementor i

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.530
by using the same var syntax we've been using all course.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.310
Then we set the condition i less than nine using an operator that we saw before,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.720
and then we increment i by one by adding i plus plus.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.010
For every trip through the loop, we're going to console.log(i).

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.460
You know what?

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.980
Before I tell you what's going to happen,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.600
I think this is something you can figure out on your own.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.330
Make a prediction.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.640
What will the result of this code be?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.440
Type your answer in this box.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.130
Once you've made your prediction, type this code into your browser's console and

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.400
press Enter to watch what happens.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.270
Is it what you expected?

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.740
When you try to type this for

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.580
loop into your browser, don't worry about putting everything on separate lines.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.410
You can type all this out on one line.
