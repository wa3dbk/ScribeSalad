00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.870
So now we know, we can find Athena's total income after x months using our

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.810
function h here. H of x equals 3000x. So let's think a bit more abstractly

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.810
about this. What do we do to our two original functions f and g to end up with

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.585
this final function h. Did we add them together? Multiply them together?

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.819
Subtract them, or divide them?
