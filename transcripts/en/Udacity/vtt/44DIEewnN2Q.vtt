00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.990
Our class code is the object-oriented
representation of a table in

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.120
our database.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.930
The only thing we need to do
is create a class name, and

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.610
make it extend from the Base
class we just created.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.040
For conventional purposes,
let's make all of our classes start with

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.540
a capital letter with no spaces in
between, also called camo casing.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.690
Inside of this class declaration,
we will add all of the code for

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.800
our table and mapper code.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.280
For this project, we will need to
create two classes to correspond with

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.360
the two tables we want to create in our
database, restaurant and menu item.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.320
Be sure to write this class
code between your beginning and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.160
ending configuration code.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.540
Inside each of our classes,
we must create a table representation,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.810
we use the special variable, double
underscore table name double underscore.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.100
To let SQLAlchemy know the variable
that we will use to refer to our table.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.450
For conventional purposes,
let's make our table names lowercase,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.190
with underscores for spaces.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.800
Inside our restaurant class, we will
set double underscore tablename double

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.820
underscore equal to restaurant,
and inside the MenuItem class we

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.990
will set it equal to menu
underscore item, as seen here.
