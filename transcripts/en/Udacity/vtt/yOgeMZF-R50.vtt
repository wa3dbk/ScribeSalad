This being a course on software debugging, let's take a look at a software problem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Mozilla is the corporation that produces the well-known Firefox browser.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In the early days of the browser, Mozilla was still in beta,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and they got lots and lots of problem reports from their early customers.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here is bug report #24735.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You already see from the number that they got very, very many bug reports.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What would happen here is that a user would start the Mozilla browser,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
would go to the website bugzilla.mozilla.org,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which actually holds all the bug reports, including this one, in Mozilla.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The browser would render the Bugzilla webpage.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There would be a link "search for bug" and users would click on it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then a number of menus would appear say selecting the operating system,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
priority or severity, where you would be able to enter or select search terms

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
before pressing the big search button.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If the user would now, with this Bugzilla page open,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
select "Print" from the menu, then the entire browser would crash with a segmentation fault.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Such bug reports were not exactly uncommon in the early days of Mozilla.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There would always be some HTML input that would come from the web server

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and then be rendered as a webpage which the browser couldn't properly handle.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's take a look at the HTML code for bugzilla.mozilla.org.
