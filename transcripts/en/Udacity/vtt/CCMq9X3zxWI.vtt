00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer to the first open question is number 9.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
1 - p to the 1 - Xi.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And this is actually quite remarkable.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The reason why I wrote p to the Xi over here

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is because we already learned every time we see a heads

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we're going to multiply in p.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So by putting this in the exponent, when Xi = 1, we multiply in p.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And if Xi = 0 we multiply in 1, which has no effect.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is exactly the inverse.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You're going to multiply in 1 - p for the tails probability whenever we see tails,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in which case 1 - Xi will be 1.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Otherwise, 1 - Xi is 0, and we just multiply in 1, which has no effect.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The logarithm of this guy over here is number 1, Xi log p.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The first derivative of this expression over here is number 7,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it's interesting it's not number 2.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There's a minus sign over here, and the minus sign is inherited

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
from the minus sign inside the logarithm using the chain rule of differentiation.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That was really non-trivial.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This one will be number 11.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We're multiplying in p and 1 - p. The 1 - p stays.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And likewise, this here is number 4.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Multiplying this out misses exactly 1 term, -pXi, which is number 3.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now we observe that these -pXi and +pXi cancel each other out,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so we get this expression over here = 0, which is number 12.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
When we now take p to the other side,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we realize there's N additions of p, number 6.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And finally, we bring N back to the left side to use number 8, 1/N

00:01:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And we are now done.
