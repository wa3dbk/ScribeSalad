00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.700
Here our solution is plus or minus 4. We start by taking the square root of

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.730
both sides of our equation. When we take the square root, we need to indicate

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.748
plus or minus, since we could have the positive value or the negative value. We

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:18.125
take the square root of 16 to get positive 4 or negative 4. These should also

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:23.840
make sense because if we square 4, we get 16. And if we square negative 4, we

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.930
get 16. Great thinking for finding those answers.
