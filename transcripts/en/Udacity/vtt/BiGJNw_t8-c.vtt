00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.870
So your goal for this quiz, is to define

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.640
a procedure, named factorial, that takes a number, which is

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.189
a positive whole number as its input, and outputs the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.070
number of ways to arrange the input number of items.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.950
So, that's the mathematical definition of factorial. And, for your

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.215
procedure, we've already seen how to do this using a

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:21.230
while loop. Your goal here is to define that procedure without

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.930
using a while loop, to define it as a recursive definition.
