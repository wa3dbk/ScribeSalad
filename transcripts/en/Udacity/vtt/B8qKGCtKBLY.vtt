00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.100
I'll start my diagram with the last commit that the coin branch has in

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.920
common with the master branch.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.780
As you can see that's the revert controls commit here.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.250
I use an ellipses to indicate there's more history off over here.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.110
After this commit our history branches off into the master branch and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.190
the coin branch.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.000
So I'll split off here, keeping the master branch straight.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.490
Each of these two branches has several more commits.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.030
I'll label the last commit made on

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.450
each branch with the appropriate branch label.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.770
Now remember, we also made a new branch off of master called easy mode, and

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.280
made one commit on it.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.830
So we'll add that to the diagram as well.
