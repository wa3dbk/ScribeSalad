00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Again we'll compute our x-bars. X-bar equals 2. Y-bar is 16.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now we'll take the differences. They're the same for the x's as they were before.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The numerator for each of these is denominator for b, so b is 9--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
interesting, exactly double what it was before. This always holds true.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If we double our y's, we always double b.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now let's see what happens to the correlation coefficient.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We take 2   64 + 4 + 100 = 168.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The correlation coefficient is 18 / √336, which is 0.982--

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
exactly the same as it was before.
