00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.659
The two answers we get are negative 3.08 and 1.08. Here's how I found them. I

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:09.381
found the first one by using a subtraction sign in here. So this is negative 1

00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:14.141
minus the square root of 13 over 3. And I found the second answer 1.08 by using

00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:18.816
the plus sign in here, negative 1 plus the root of 13 over 3. This means that

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:23.606
our X intercepts are at -3.08, 0 and 1.08, 0. I would like to make one little

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:28.780
change on here though. Since these are rounded answers, let's put approximately

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.774
equal to signs between these. These are approximate numbers, and if we wanted

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:38.942
to, we could continue calculating out these infinitely long decimals by looking

00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:41.316
for their out and calculating these.
