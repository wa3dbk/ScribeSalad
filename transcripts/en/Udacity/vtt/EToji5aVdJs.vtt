00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.014
We'll add one to both sides to complete the square for the x terms. And we'll

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:08.886
add 4 to both sides to complete the square for the y terms. Nice thinking if

00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:13.359
you got those numbers. Remember to complete the square, we need to add b over 2

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:19.242
squared. The b value is the coefficient in front of the single x term. Notice

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:25.496
that we just have x to the first power. So that means b must equal 2 here. So

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:31.057
we'll have 2 divided by 2 which equals 1 and 1 squared is positive 1. So we add

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:35.400
this to the left hand side and the right hand side of our equation. For the y

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.424
terms, our b value is 4. So we'll have 4 divided by 2 which equals 2 and we'll

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:46.780
square it to get 4. This is what we add to the left and to the right.
