00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.530
Now I want to consider the contents of the page table

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.840
entries, at least the entries at the leaves of the hierarchy. In

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.090
our example where we had a 32-bit physical address space, it

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.170
would be typical to have a page table entries also of 32

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.149
bits. With 4k pages, only 20 bits would be needed for

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.940
the physical page frame. What do we do with the other 12

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.155
bits? Well it turns out that there's lots of other information worth

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.370
storing in the page table. Some of the more important are things

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.240
like access control. Do we have read, write, or execute

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.110
permissions on this memory? If we don't, then when we

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.310
come to this page entry, an access violation or segmentation

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.570
fault will occur. Another essential piece of information is whether

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.880
the information associated with the virtual address is actually in

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.430
memory at the moment. It may be the data that

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.560
we need was not loaded on the application's start-up or

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.710
it may have been swapped out to disk. In either

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.950
of those cases, the valid or the present bit would be

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.190
zero. When a process tries to access a page with a valid

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.160
bit of zero, it creates a page fault and let's the OS

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.700
try to bring the needed data into memory. We'll look at the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.440
page fault handler next. One of these bits also indicates whether

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.450
the page is dirty. That is, has it been written to since

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.060
it was loaded for disk? If not, then if it becomes necessary

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.790
to evict this page from memory, there is no need to write

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.050
it to disk if it's already there. A nice

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.210
optimization. Sometimes a bit or two will also control

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.660
how caching of this page is done. Page table

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.760
entries corresponding to virtual addresses that were never mapped

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.770
to a physical address by the OS usually have

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.430
physical frame numbers of zero. The physical frame number

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.388
of zero is rather like a null pointer. Everybody

00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:40.844
knows that that's an invalid physical frame number and a

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:42.970
segment fault will be generated.
