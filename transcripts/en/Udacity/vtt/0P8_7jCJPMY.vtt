00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.226
Before we said that we can translate our absolute value inequality, to say that

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:10.225
the distance between x and 4 was at most 5. Now, however, we have the distance

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:15.236
between x and 4 is at least 5. How would you translate this into a mathematical

00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:19.816
expression? Just as a hint try to use some absolute value signs and an

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:20.717
inequality.
