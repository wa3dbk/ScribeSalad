00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
With this we have provided a basic mechanism

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to record and replay arbitrary function calls

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
together with their values.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This mechanism, in general, allows to record arbitrary interaction between program parts,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
as well as arbitrary interaction between the program and its environment.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But this is just a tiny slice of what can be done in record and replay.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Actually, while being pretty general, it's also pretty limited yet.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In particular, one could store the list of calls in a file

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
such that it can be reproduced at any time,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
handle structured elements properly, that is, lists and maps,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
record, and possibly replay, return values too.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Record global variables, or record only a subset of all calls.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Python makes recording and replaying function calls very easy.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Especially compared to compiled languages such as Java or C.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So feel free to toy around and expand this code.
