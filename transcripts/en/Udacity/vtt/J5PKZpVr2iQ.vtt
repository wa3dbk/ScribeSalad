00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We had another question that was on version control

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and what it is and which ones you should use,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
because there are quite a few out there. &gt;&gt;Okay, sure.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is purely subjective answer, but that's why you're here, I guess, right?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I use get. I would recommended everybody use Git.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's really, really nice.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I used CVS back in the day and then Subversion replaced that.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Then Mecurio replaced that and now I use Git and that's great.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Basically the whole notion is you have the source directory

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and you're making changes to files and you can log what those changes are,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
what they were for, you can go back in history, you can merge changes together,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you can be working with multiple people and merge your changes together.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So it's a great way to share code between multiple computers.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's a great way to keep track of your development.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I do it. For example, in Udacity I've got a Git project for all the files I'm using

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
for you guys, for my blog.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Occasionally I have these different branches for different homework,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
so I can be recording unit 6 and then working on homework 3.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I can switch between those two states of the code really easily,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and then I can check out the homework 3 branch and tar it up and put it online for you guys.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Then I can go back into the future to homework 6, that sort of thing.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's really handy, and it's very fast. It's really good.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It was written by a Linus Torvalds who also wrote Linux.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
He's a pretty competent guy. &gt;&gt;Probably.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I would suggest Git. You can use Git Hub.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Git Hub is like a third-party cipher storing a code if you want to store it in a remote location.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We use Git Hub for Hipmunk, for example, and Reddit, incidentally.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There you go. Short answer is Git.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If somebody tells you different, raise an eyebrow. &gt;&gt;Great.
