00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.508
What we've been looking at for the last few examples is vertex form. Vertex

00:00:05.508 --> 00:00:10.360
form indicates the vertex of a parabola, h and k. For parabolas that open up

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.390
and down, the h value is the opposite sign of the one in the binomial, and the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.394
k value is the one on the end. Remember we can always find the x coordinate of

00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:25.474
this vertex by setting the binomial equal to zero. And if we look at the number

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:28.951
in front of the squared term, we can determine whether or not the parabola

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:35.140
opens up, or if the parabola opens down. If the a value is positive or greater

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.596
than 0, the parabola opens up. And if the a value is negative, or less than 0,

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:45.622
then the parabola must open down. Horizontal parabolas are a little bit more

00:00:45.622 --> 00:00:50.738
tricky. These parabolas start with x equals and either open to the right or to

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:58.482
the left. We find the vertex by looking at h and k. Notice here that h is added

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:03.352
on the end or subtracted in some cases. And k is the number inside the

00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:08.115
binomial. Notice that h is now the number on the end, where k is the number in

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:13.564
the binomial. We can find the y coordinate of the vertex by setting this

00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:18.296
binomial equal to zero. The x coordinate of the vertex, for horizontal

00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:23.395
parabolas, will just be the number, added or subtracted, on the end. And

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:26.915
finally, if the a value was greater than 0 or positive, we know the graph opens

00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:32.093
to the right. Whereas if the a value is less than 0, or negative, then our

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:34.760
graph opens to the left.
