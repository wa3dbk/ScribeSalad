So I have this picture of the queen Mary. Let's slightly dim this picture by

00:00:03.846 --> 00:00:07.714
turning every 5th pixel black. You saw how to use the pixels method to get the

00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:12.132
number of pixels. And how to use the set pixel at method to change the color of

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:17.836
a pixel. You'll need a for loop. What should your indices be to avoid index out

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:19.323
of bound errors?
