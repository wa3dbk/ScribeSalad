00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Let's take a look at value proposition.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.240
Value proposition is not something you're building in isolation.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.980
While the value proposition is about solving a customer problem or need,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.490
it really consists of 3 components.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.630
The easy one for most entrepreneurs to talk about is what product features you have

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.780
or what product services you're providing.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.280
But there's actually 2 more important components to value proposition:

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.880
What gain are you creating for customers?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.350
And what pain are you solving for them?

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.580
Alexander Osterwalder, when he drew the business model canvas,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.170
really emphasized this. It's not just about your product.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.850
And especially if you come from a technical background, it's really easy to say,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.850
"Oh, look at all these features."

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.390
And if you find yourself doing that, you need to complete the sentence and say,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.160
"Yes, but here's what we make people be able to do better,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.640
"and here are the problems we solve for them."

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.130
So the real goal of you figuring out the value proposition

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.560
is understanding what we call the minimal viable product.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.020
You're trying to figure out, "Now that I kind of understand my product and service

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.380
"and what I'm gaining for customers and the pain I'm solving,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.270
"what's the smallest possible feature set I could be shipping on day 1

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.650
"that solves these pains and creates gains for them?"

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.920
And this really is an interactive process

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.810
because there is no way, no possible way, sitting in your office you could figure this out.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.060
And the default for great engineers and great entrepreneurs is,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.640
"Oh, I understand customers' problems and needs,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.740
"so don't worry about it. We'll just spec the entire product on day 1."

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.870
Your real goal here is to figure out what's the smallest thing you could build and develop

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.460
that actually gets you users or sales or whatever

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.560
and get out to market as quickly as possible.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.590
And so the goal of you getting out of the building for value proposition

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.450
is understanding gains and pains so you can figure out what's the MVP,

00:02:00.450 --> 99:59:59.000
or minimum viable product.
