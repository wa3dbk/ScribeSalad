00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.380
Now that we've familiarize ourselves with the normal distribution,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.720
let's discuss one of the most common parametric test

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.470
that we might use to compare two sets of

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.490
data. Such as our samples of left handed and right

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.120
handed [INAUDIBLE], that would be the t-test. The t-test

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.800
like many statistical tests aims at accepting or rejecting

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.330
a null hypothesis. A null hypothesis is generally a

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.140
statement that we're trying to disprove by running our test.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.740
For example, that two samples came from the same

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.710
population. This might mean that left-handed and right-handed batters show

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.460
no real difference in their batting average, or that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.620
a certain sample is drawn from a particular probability distribution.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.600
For example, if we had a sample of 20

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.010
heights and weights of Arbitrary baseball players, we might want

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.570
to test how likely it is that those 20 people

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.920
are drawn from the known MLB player population. A hypothesis

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.490
test such as the t-test is usually specified in

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.090
terms of a test statistic. The test statistic reduces

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.220
your data set to one number that helps to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.530
accept or reject the null hypothesis. When performing a T-test,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.270
we compute a test statistic called T. Depending on

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.070
the value of the test statistic T, we can determine

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.430
whether or not or null hypothesis is true. In

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.070
the case of the one sample T-test, our null hypothesis

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.550
would be that the population mean, mu, is equal to our

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.090
sample mean, mu not. In the T sample case, which we'll be

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.150
more concerned about for the purposes of our example, The null

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.740
hypothesis would be about our population means, m0 and m1 are equal.
