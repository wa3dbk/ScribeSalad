00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Usually when people talk about auditing, the more is always better.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The more auditing you can do--other than the cost of it--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the more you have a likelihood of catching cheating.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But in this case, that's not the case. We have to be careful.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If we audited all the outputs of the mix net,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
well then I would reveal exactly what the permutation was.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We have a tradeoff here between voter anonymity and catching cheating of the mixes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If we just audited one output, the chances of catching cheating would be too low.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If there are N votes and mix net can chew on half of them,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we then be one half probability of getting caught.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is much too low. It's probably not necessary to cheat on half the votes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The last step can see what the actual votes are and decide which ones to cheat on.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Cheating on a much smaller fashion than one half and getting caught with the much

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
less probability than one half would make that risk worthwhile in many situations.
