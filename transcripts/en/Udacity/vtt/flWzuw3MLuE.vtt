00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.250
All right.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.300
So, J.P. gave you a very good summary of
what the options are, available to you.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.720
When you use firebases rules and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.270
security language But,
what do these rules actually look like.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.650
Before we dive into validation,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.720
let's take a quick look at how
these rules are structured.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.280
You already saw an example of what
rules look like ,when we looked at

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.550
the dashboard before.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.450
In fact clicking here, is where
you'll need to go to edit your rules.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.768
Once you're in the Security &amp; Rules tab,
you could write your rules here and

00:00:24.768 --> 00:00:26.160
save them using this button.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.070
Any changes that you save,
will immediately affect any read or

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.740
write calls sent to
your Firebase database.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.200
These rules should also look
familiar from when in Version 0.4,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.859
we talked about using index on and
value rules, okay.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.870
So, here are the default rules,
the rules themselves are adjacent,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.670
which look similar to your
firebase database itself.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.170
There are string key value pairs,
which are separated by colons nd

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.370
everything that's considered
an object or list.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.820
Is surrounded by curly braces,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.390
as seen here, remember that these
strings are enclosed in quotes.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.260
If you're not super familiar with
this sort of adjacent syntax,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.480
I've provided a link to
a sample rules file.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.520
That you could look at to
base your rule syntax off of.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.010
So, what are these rules doing?

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.210
Well, these are the simplest
of simple list rules,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.860
your rules file will always start
with this rules object here.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.450
And then usually,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.050
the children inside of it mirror
the structure of your actual database.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.230
In this case, these rules are providing
access to the entire database,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.100
no matter what the structure
happens to be.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.370
It's read and write viewable and
there are no validation rules, so

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.390
there aren't any structural
constraints here.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.480
Including these two rules
is actually important,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.400
because by default access
to the data is false.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.530
So, you do need these rules to
explicitly say, that read is true for

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.230
the whole database and
right is true for the whole database.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.910
Because if I actually deleted this and
saved it, by default,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.000
nobody would be able to write anything
to the database but I would do that.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.840
Normally your rules are going to
mirror your database structure.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.770
So for example, if I wanted to
write some rules to validate

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.140
the structure of my user node,
I might write something like this.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.560
As you can see here, I've got
the exact route name of the user and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.060
here, I've got the key names
embedded of all the properties.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.270
So your key names here need to match
exactly what's shown in your database

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.400
and they need to be nested
in exactly the same way.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.723
Now, you might be wondering what
this key here is all about.

00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:13.260
the dollar sign followed by a word,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.010
indicates what is noted firebase
as a wildcard variable.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.740
Now wildcard variables have
a couple different uses but

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.970
the most common one is,
to represent dynamic keys like push ids.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.890
And in this case, user emails,
because remember,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.860
under the user node is
a list of user emails.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.690
The keys of which we
can't guess in advance.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.320
Now, once you've laid
out this structure,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.980
you can start defining rules for
the user object.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.040
When you want to write a rule for
a particular location, you go to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.890
the location in your rules file that
mirrors the location in your database.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.230
And this is your first
example of a rule,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.630
the Kiva rule is always a dot read,
dot write or dot validate value.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.540
And the value of a rule
will always be something

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.670
that evaluates to a boolean and
this is important.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.740
Because when a user tries to read or
write at that location,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.700
the value of this boolean affects
whether they're actually able to do so.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.240
Now, these expressions that evaluate
to billions can get pretty complicated,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.070
they can include comparison and
logical operators.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.770
And Firebase also provides
additional methods and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.430
internal preset variables that allow you
to get a value at the current location.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.990
Or compare to other
locations of the database.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.700
For example, there are methods that let
you look at the data at children and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.190
parent locations of
your current location.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.900
So if necessary,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.020
you could do comparisons between
the value of name of the value of email.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.430
Or even the value of name and
someplace totally else in the database.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.990
Okay, so
once you've written this out and

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.860
you actually start to try to read or
write data at certain locations.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.090
All of the applicable rules along the
path to that location, will be checked.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.550
Validate and write rules are checked
whenever a value is written, and

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.930
read rules are checked whenever
listeners are attached.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.200
For example,
if I try to write in this location,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.330
with a value Lyla, any rules that
are at the lylafish@gmail.com location.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.610
Which is this variable here,
there aren't any rules here, and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.110
at the name location,
which has one validate rule here.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.920
So total, because this is a right,
these two rules would be checked,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.520
now let's pretend that this
right rule wasn't here.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.290
This was actually the rule that was
giving me the ability to write to

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.279
this location.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.240
So if you ever tried to
do something like that,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.370
where you don't have permission to
do the action that you want to do.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.610
The on cancel callback method Will
be triggered in your code, and

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.320
it will be given a FirebaseError Of
type PERMISSION_DENIED.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.700
All right, I've just thrown in
lot of information at you, so

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.610
let me take a moment to summarize.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.510
Your rules file as found in the firebase
dashboard in the security and

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.310
rules tab and the rules
themselves are written in JSON.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.240
The actual permissions will have keys
that are .right, .read or .validate and

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.270
they will always have values that
evaluate to either true or false.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.460
If there is no read or
write rule at a location or

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.150
its parent locations,
then it will default to false.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.410
When you are writing your permission
rule, you'll place it in the rules

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.190
location that mirrors the database
location that you're interested in.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.440
If a user tries to do something that
is not allowed by the read, write or

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.700
validate rules.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.150
The FirebaseError will
be returned to them and

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.580
its value will be Permission_Denied.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.520
Okay, and those are basically the facts
that you need to get started.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.190
So go ahead and we'll start
laying out some of these rules.
