00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.409
For the predicate operation, both will take the same amount of time.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:09.301
Both will run their predicate on each of 1 million items. Scan will also take the identical amount of time.

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:15.397
Scan is going to run on an array of a million items. Where they're going to differ is scatter.

00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:20.268
A will run faster than B for scatter because there's fewer memory operations,

00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:24.090
since fewer elements need to be copied into the output array.
