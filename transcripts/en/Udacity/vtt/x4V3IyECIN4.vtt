00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.300
Now, you may have noticed some peaks in May or perhaps

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.840
in October, but I think what's really interesting is this huge spike

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.140
on January first. There's almost 4,000 users in this bin. Now, this

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.740
could be because of the default settings that Facebook uses or perhaps

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.380
users are choosing the first choice in the drop down menus.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.100
Another idea is that some users may want to protect their privacy

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.090
and so they just go with January first by default. Whatever the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.230
case may be, I think it's important that we make our considerations

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.130
in the context of our data. We want to look out for these types of anomalies.
