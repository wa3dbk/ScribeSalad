00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How much difference does the coefficient of friction make?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's compute what's going to happen if we brake with a very high friction 1.0,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is really optimistic, and with a slightly less friction.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Our car should be traveling at 120 km/h, which is approximately 75 miles/h.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
How long will it take to come to a complete stop? Enter the numbers of seconds with 1 decimal place.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here's a hint--think about this diagram, how does the velocity of the car depend on time

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and think about Newton law from Unit 1.
