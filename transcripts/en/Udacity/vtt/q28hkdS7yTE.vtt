00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.760
You may notice for some types like e-mail,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.610
there's some basic validation. But, it doesn't really understand.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.140
If you want to do better client side validation though,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.910
HTML-5 supports that too. There's also a pattern attribute on

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.320
the input element, that you can use to validate on

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.370
the client side. The pattern element takes a regular expression,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.020
as expressed by the java script regex syntax. Regex is

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.320
a topic in itself. So, if you're not familiar with

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.350
it, you'll have to look it up. For example, let's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.440
presume I want to only allow U.S. numbers with area

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.890
code prefixes. So, an 11 digit number. I can put in a regular expression for

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.120
this, and now when I try to input a telephone number and then submit, it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.700
pops up an error message that says I have to match the requested format. That

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.650
error message, by the way, is the element's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.870
title, so you can customize it too. And

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.680
now, I get my custom error message. Normally

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.280
of course, I'm not going to want such a

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.470
simplistic pattern. I'll probably going to want something more,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.246
like this string which says, I want a 3

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:17.000
digit number possibly preceded by brackets, and then optionally

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.450
a space or a period or a dash, and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.300
then another 3 digits, and then the same space

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.190
or period or dash, and then another 4 digits.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.370
Now, this gives some options, for how I enter telephone

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.220
numbers, but I can just say, and it'll accept that.
