00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.030
Another source of error cited at
that symposium was an incorrect

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.760
system default.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.700
This can occur in at least two ways.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.170
A particular EHR could have been set
up to default to a particular value,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.810
and the provider may overlook
that while charting.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.640
Another, and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.590
far more insidious possibility
is that EHR remembers the values

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.920
from a patient's prior visit to save
the physician time in charting this one.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.550
The obvious potential
error is to document

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.400
what may have been correct last time,
but is wrong this time.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.920
Another source of error derives from
the desire to save the provider time

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.110
by fitting as much as possible
onto each data entry screen.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.560
This can lead to a cluttered
and/or illogical layout

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.840
that can cause information
to be overlooked.
