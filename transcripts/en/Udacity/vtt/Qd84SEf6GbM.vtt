00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Oh, hey. We're back. Welcome.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Excuse me a sec. I was just sketching out a business plan on the back of this napkin.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So I have an idea, then question mark, then profit.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But you know, this just doesn't work so well.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
These napkins are so porous the markers don't work on them.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I think I'm going to throw away this cliche and move to a different cliche:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the back of the envelope.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Much easier to write on the back of the envelope, and it's a really valuable skill.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's a valuable skill in real life to be able to do quick and dirty calculations,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and it's especially useful for computer programmers.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It allows computer programmers to have the important virtue of being lazy.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You don't normally think of lazy as being a virtue, but it is.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It allows us to say we're going to come up with the simplest design we can,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
validate on the back of an envelope that that design is efficient enough

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
for what we're trying to do, and then we can stop.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We don't have to try to make it more complex.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This whole class is about managing complexity,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and one of the most important ways to manage complexity is to leave it out completely,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
just go for the simple solution.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If we can do that, then we're well on our way to better designs.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In this class we'll learn how to do that,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we'll learn how to do the calculations of when you're efficient enough,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we'll learn when to stop, and we'll learn how to make programs more efficient.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm going to start with a well-known puzzle called the Zebra Puzzle.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Here's a description of it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We're going to try to address this puzzle, see if we can come up with a program to solve it,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and explore the methodology for how we come up with that solution

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and the process of deciding what's a good enough solution

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and whether a brute force solution will work.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You can read the description of the puzzle here.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now let's start to analyze it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We'll begin with an inventory of the concepts in the puzzle

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
just to make sure that we understand what's going on.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The first concept is houses.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We're told there's 5 of them.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And then there's properties of the inhabitants of these houses and of the houses themselves.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So there's nationality, colors of the houses, the pets that they own,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the drinks that they drink, and the smokes that they smoke.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And then in addition to properties, there's a notion of assignment of properties to houses.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And you can think of that either way.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You can think of it as assigning house number 2 the color red

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
or think of it as assigning red to house number 2.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Then there's a notion of locations,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the locations 1 through 5 that mention the idea of the first house

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and the middle house and of the next to relation and of the immediately to the right relation.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I think that covers most of what was in the specification.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Let's go back to it and see if it works.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So I'm seeing lots of concepts that we've already covered:

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
5 houses, Englishman, red house, Spaniard, dog.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
There's a few words that we haven't covered,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
things like lives in and owns the.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We covered them in a generic sense of saying it's an assignment of Englishman to a house

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and assignment of the dog to a house,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
but the question is, do we need to separate out the different types of assignment?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So the question is, are we missing this idea of a property name with a description attached?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So for example, the property name would be nationality

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and the description is lived in.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Do we need to name them like that,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
or do we just need the notion of a property group

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
to say that there are these properties of Englishman, Spaniard, Norwegian,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Japanese, and Ukranian, and the 5 of them go together

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but we don't need the name for them,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
or can we ignore this notion of grouping altogether?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This is somewhat subjective--what's a good design choice?--

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but tell me which of these 3 do you think are plausible or reasonable design choices

00:04:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and check all that apply.
