00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's the intuition?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you drive a car and your normal steering mode leads you to a trajectory far away from the goal,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
then what I submit you do is you notice over a long period of time you can't get closer.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So you start steering more and more the more time goes by to the right to compensate this bias.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As a result, when you drive you steer the car this way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
To do so, you need a sustained situation of large error.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's measured by the integral or the sum of the crosstrack errors over time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's make a new controller where steering is proportional to the crosstrack errors before.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's equally proportional to the differential of the crosstrack error,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but now it's also proportional to what's called the integral or the sum

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of all the crosstrack errors you ever observed.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This term is interesting. If we have a constant crosstrack error of, say, 0.8

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and the sum will increase by 0.8 for each time unit, it'll become larger and larger and larger,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and eventually it'll correct the robot's motion.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is called the PID controller.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is the P or the proportional term, the D or the differential term, and the i for integral.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
P-I-D.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Let's implement this, and the integrated crosstrack error

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is the sum of all crosstrack errors you ever observed.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Let's implement this in our code.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I give you an integral factor of 0.004.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Let's not worry why I picked those. They're actually wisely chosen, as you will see in a minute.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But let's run our code and now modify our code to also allow for this parameter over here.
