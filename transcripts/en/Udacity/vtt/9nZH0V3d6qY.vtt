00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.562
To get the equation for pq, we just need to multiply p and q together. So we

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:10.330
have x plus 4 times negative 2x minus 5. I would prefer to simplify this, so

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.949
let's do that. That leaves us with negative 2x squared minus 13x minus 20.
