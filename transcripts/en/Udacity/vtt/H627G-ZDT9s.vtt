00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.126
Here's your second problem using area and perimeter. This time, you want to

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:09.550
construct an enclosed dog run using 46 feet of fencing. If you only have enough

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.330
concrete to cover 120 square feet, what should be the dimensions of your dog

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.572
run? Now, you might not even know what a dog run is, but it's just like a patio

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:22.186
or even a rectangular garden. Try doing some research to find out what the

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:25.654
diagram looks like. Then, see if you can create a diagram to help you problem

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:30.270
solve. When you think you have the length and width, enter them here.
