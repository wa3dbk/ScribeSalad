00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.624
So we'll need to save the name of the country as well as the country's

00:00:02.624 --> 00:00:06.498
population. We'll initialize largest country name with the first country that

00:00:06.498 --> 00:00:09.474
we look at, sort of the way we initialized largest population with just the

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:14.210
population that we looked at. Now when we find something which has a population

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.546
larger than the largest population. We'll need to update the largest country

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.449
name as well as the largest population. Now, when our program gets to the end,

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.989
where we print things out, it'll still have access to the largest and the

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.826
largest country name, but it's only printing out the population. So I'll add a

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:35.661
line, print the country with the largest population is and the variable where

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:40.230
we saved the largest country's name. When it asks for a file, I'll find the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.194
population file. And I get that the country with the largest population is

00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:51.160
Afghanistan at 3.0419E7. That seems pretty funny to me. I don't think of

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.080
Afghanistan as a very big country. Let's look at these numbers. Afghanistan has

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.445
eight digits. But Bangladesh has nine. Clearly there's something wrong with the

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:05.464
program. It looks like it's set the largest population and the largest

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:11.360
population name the first time, but then after that, probably didn't update it.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.203
So there must be something wrong with my loop. Oh! It's looking for a double

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:18.869
first, but the format of the file has the name of the country first, and then

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.630
something that could be read as a double. So this should actually just be,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.510
hasNext not hasNextDouble. Let's try this again. Okay. Now I'm getting that the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.910
country with the largest population is China, with this as it's population.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.119
That seems much more reasonable.
