00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To answer this question, we can just list off each operation in clique

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that takes 1 unit of time.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
First, we print. Second, we evaluate range of 4, which returns (0, 1, 2, 3)

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then since j is 0 the first time,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we evaluate range of 0 and nothing gets printed.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Next, we loop through again and j = 1,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so we evaluate range of 1, and we print once.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, j = 2, and we evaluate range of 2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In range of two, we print twice.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Going through the loop again, now j = 3.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, we evaluate the range of 3.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In the inner loop we print 3 times.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We can count this up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 operations.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, our answer is 12 units.
