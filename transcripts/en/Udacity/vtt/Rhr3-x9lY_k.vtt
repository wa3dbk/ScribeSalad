00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.320
Okay, so I'd like to talk about this a

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.220
new concept called a Cache Stampede. So we, we've

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.010
got a use case now, you know a user

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.060
makes a request and a request probably bounces off our

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.720
cache and returns. Now if, if a user makes

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.270
the, a post request that edits the database. We

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.610
clear the cache and on the next request from

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.780
that user, we go back to the database and update

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.390
our cache and return to the user. The user submits,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.670
we clear the cache, and on a following request we do

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.210
the whole chain agian. Now, a problem happens when we

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.950
have many users. Say that one of these guys posts to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.590
the database. Which writes the database, which clears our cache,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.900
and then the rest of these guys, you know, they're just

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.470
browsing the site. They all come to the site at the

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.510
same time. So we've got all these requests coming in to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.910
ASCII Chan and our cache is empty. They're all coming at

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.390
the same time. We just cleared the cache, and what's going to happen

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.370
is they're all going to say okay, the cache is empty, therefore

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.629
we must all read from the database at the same time. Cause

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.290
they're all like okay, cache is empty, we need to update

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.590
the cache, and them bam bam bam bam bam, they all hit

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.140
the database, running the exact same query just, so they can store

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.660
in the cache. This is called a cache stampede, and what happens

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.290
is the database gets beat up, and. You know that

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.260
query that only takes a few milliseconds before, because it is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.070
a small database could take a lot of time. Or never

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.510
return at all because of all of the queries are blocking

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.650
at each other. That is something that we saw happen

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.040
at reddit we kind of went through this whole process kind

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.880
of learning as we go. Cached stampedes are really painful, but

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.750
the solution is Fairly simply. So a Cache Stampede is when

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.790
multiple cache misses from so much traffic create too much

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.220
load on the database. Or not necessarily database, whatever slow computation

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.940
you've got going on that you don't want to do

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.350
very many of. You know that you constrained for resources to

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.710
compute. Let's have a quick quiz and see if we

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.270
can figure out the solution to this problem. Okay how can

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.820
we avoid a cache stampede? We replicate the database to

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.940
handle more reads. Only allow one web request at a time.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.660
Only allow one database request at a time, or database query, at a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.640
time. Or, don't clear the cache, but instead overwrite it with new data.
