This is referred to as the Bayer to RGB demosaicing process.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.600
In this case we just take a four by four subset and use that simple math and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.350
average to start to create an RGB triple.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.510
And that, of course, is the one that's to create those layers.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.780
There's a lot of literature on this kind of demosaicing.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.220
I encourage all of you to look it up,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.340
and and kind of try to understand the whole process as needed.
