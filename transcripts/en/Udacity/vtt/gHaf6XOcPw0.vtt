00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.490
That's right, even such a small change,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.770
causes a slightly more than one percent drop

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.930
in user engagement, and realized income. Now

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.040
that may seem tiny, but one percent of

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.300
your income is probably pretty significant when

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.990
it's such a small performance change. If the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.490
perf delay is a second, revenue drops by more than double. It's not even linear.
