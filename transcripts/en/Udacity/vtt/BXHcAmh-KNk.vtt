00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.420
Let's explore the Bootstrap documentation for the grid system.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.580
These first three lines are really important.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.400
The first one says that all rows must be placed within a container or

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.450
a fluid container.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.970
This allows them to have the right alignment and padding on the page.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.690
We'll also be using rows to create horizontal groups of columns,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.100
which means columns that are lined up one next to each other.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.950
And this last point says that your content has to be inside of a column and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.290
a column has to be inside of a row.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.430
Back to our mockup.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.490
We've gone ahead and put some boxes around the different elements on the page.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.550
We have a container encompassing the entire page.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.580
We've got a row right here in the middle that includes Appify and Sunflower.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.960
And then Appify itself is just a single column inside this row.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.520
You can see other examples.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.630
For instance, at the top, we have a header.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.760
That's going to be a row.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.410
And inside of our row, we have two columns, one on the left and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.940
one on the right.
