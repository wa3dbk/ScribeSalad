00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.480
But the problem doesn't stop there. Metadata is

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.030
overloaded, but my video has gotten popular. And

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.240
so all of these guys want to download

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.870
the content from me, which means that everybody

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.860
is coming to me, and I have an itsy bitsy server in my basement. And that

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.230
is going to get inundated with all of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.820
these download requests from all of these different clients

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.119
that want to get this video from me. So, there is a metadata overload and there

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.725
is a content overload that is coming about

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:38.990
because of the fact that something became really hot

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.590
and everybody wants to get that content. And

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.980
this is what is called the origin server

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.870
overload. In general, there are two solutions to

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.250
the origin server overload problem. The first solution is

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.010
to have a web proxy. And you might

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.490
be familiar with this already because every organization tends

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.970
to have a web proxy so that they can limit the amount of requests that have to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.360
go out of an organization. And that way if users of an organization

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.430
are trying to access popular content from the Internet, the local web proxy

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.000
that's available in the organization can directly serve

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.860
that content to the requesters. But it turns out that

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.540
the web proxy solution is not good enough for what

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.970
is called a Slashdot effect. And that is, if there

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.760
is a breaking news and everyone wants to get the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.080
content, they will have to get the fresh content. A

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.540
proxy's not good enough for that. Let's say that there's

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.860
a Super Bowl going on and everybody wants to watch

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.150
the Super Bowl, or at least get the latest updates

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.110
from that. In that case, the web proxy's

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.480
not going to be good, because the content

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.600
in the web proxy is cached content. You

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.550
want the live content. And the live content is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.200
only available at the origin server, not at

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.520
the proxies, and therefore the origin server will get

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.895
overloaded when we have such dynamic content. Content

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:07.910
that is resulting from either breaking news, or live

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.970
programming, and so on. And this is

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.470
where the content distribution networks come into play.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.200
The idea is that the content is

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.200
automatically mirrored from the origin server at selected

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.600
geographical locations. And those locations are constantly

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.090
getting updated from the origin server. So that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.440
going to any of the mirrored content is the same as going to the origin server.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.990
And then what happens is that, in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.120
the content distribution network, depending on the geographical

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.830
area from which a particular user request

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.518
originates, the user request is dynamically re-routed to

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:50.670
the geo-local mirror of the content so

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.920
that the origin server need not be overloaded.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.190
You may be familiar with companies like Akamai

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.655
which have come about for the purposes of

00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:03.150
providing content distribution network for popular

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.920
content providers, like CNN or broadcast television

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.750
channels like CBS, NBC, and so on. And what these organizations, that is

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.930
the content providers, do is get into an agreement with a content distribution

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.175
network provider like Akamai, so that they don't have to worry about origin

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:29.510
server overload because the content distribution network

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.360
provider like Akamai have the solution for

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.740
taking the content of the origin and

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.991
automatically mirroring it in geo-local sites so

00:03:38.991 --> 00:03:44.240
that the origin server never gets overloaded. So, this is good if you are a big

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.830
organization like CNN, or CBS. You can afford to pay the content

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.620
distribution network provider to do this automatic mirroring, but

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.610
how can we democratize content distribution. How am I,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.080
in my basement, generating a piece of video and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.980
I want to share it with the world, how

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.410
am I going to make that available to everybody?

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.220
If it gets hot, I don't want to get

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.160
overloaded. I want the content distribution network to work

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.140
without having to pay big bucks to a content

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.519
distribution network provider like Akamai. And this

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.220
is where the Coral System comes in. This

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.590
is a paper that I've assigned you

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.670
to read which has a technique for democratizing

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.100
content distribution. And the details of the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.820
Coral System, and what we're going to look

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.660
at next. So the Coral System addresses two

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.600
issues. The first issue is the fact that

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.690
if I generate some content, and I want to store the key value pair

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.250
associated with the content in a DHT, I have to have a scalable way of

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.160
doing it without saturating any particular node

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.770
which can serve as a metadata server. So

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.920
we want to avoid the tree-saturation effect and the second thing we want to do

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.120
is also avoid the origin server overload.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.810
So both of those things are being addressed

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.190
in providing a democratic solution for content

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.340
distribution for the average Joe that may want

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.250
to generate some content, and want to share it with the rest of the world.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.440
We will look at the details of the Coral System in the rest of this lecture.
