00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.940
The last class of drugs we're going to discuss are the hallucinogens, or

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.470
psychedelics. These drugs can erratically distort the way a person perceives.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.270
In addition, it can change the way they think, as well as the way they feel.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.955
Sometimes when people take these substances, they can experience great fear or

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:22.244
anxiety. But in some cases, they say that it changes the way they view the

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:27.460
world. In addition, we see that people can experience synesthesia, and this is

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.976
a crossing over of the senses. For example, a person may hear colors or taste

00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:37.944
sounds. In addition, LSD can bring back long-lost memories and some people

00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:44.144
report a dying of the ego while taking this drug. Now, it's no doubt that some

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.264
people have experienced troublesome or even a frightening experiences from

00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:52.092
taking hallucinogenic substances. And there's some research to support the idea

00:00:52.092 --> 00:00:55.996
that one of these agents can act as an epigenetic agent and turn on the gene

00:00:55.996 --> 00:01:02.059
that codes for mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia. Therefore, some major

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.992
caution for some people using hallucinogenic substances. Now, LSD has its

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:10.546
effect at the serotonin receptor and we see that psilocybin or magic mushrooms

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:14.962
also affect the serotonin receptor system however, not to the same degree as

00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:23.084
LSD. Psilocybin can produce changes in perception and cognition as well. In

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:26.742
fact, some people have said that LSD demands introspection whereas as

00:01:26.742 --> 00:01:28.860
psilocybin invites it.
