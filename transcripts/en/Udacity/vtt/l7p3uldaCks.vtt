To help us really understand this example let's make a tetrahedral die. There, I

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:20.654
have a tetrahedral dice. So this vertex is number 2. This vertex here is number

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:28.656
1. Here's number 4. And here's number 3. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 are analogous to

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:35.055
our population. So when we roll the die, we can get either a 1, 2, 3, or 4.

00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:36.899
What's the mean.
