00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.650
Let us start from where we left off when we finished [UNKNOWN] analysis.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.802
This was the current state, this was the goal state. As we saw from

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:12.960
[UNKNOWN] analysis, achieving this goal state is not a very easy problem.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.770
However, we can think of this goal state as being composed of several sub goals,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.210
so D on top of table. C on top of D. B on top of C. A on top of B.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.700
Four sub goals here. Now, we can try to address this problem by looking at

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.540
one sub goal at a time. Let us suppose that we have picked this sub goal,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.050
C on top of D. Give that sub goal, we can now start from this current state and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.100
try to achieve this sub goal. Now of course, one might ask the question, why did

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.040
we pick the goal C over D, and not the goal, B over C, or the goal A over B?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.380
Well one reason is that, the difference between this state and that state had to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.540
do with C over D. But in general, problem reduction by itself does not tell us,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.930
what sub-goal to attack first. That is a problem, we'll address later when we

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.670
come to planning. Well now the major point is, that we can decompose the goal

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.320
into several subgoals, and attack one subgoal at a time. Now that we have C over

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.350
D as a subgoal, we really don't carry about whether A is on B or B is on C. What

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.400
we are focused on is the other two states, C on table, D on table, because those

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.831
are the blocks that occur in the goal state. So let us now see how [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:32.150
have been solved this sub problem [INAUDIBLE] goal C on D and D on Table.
