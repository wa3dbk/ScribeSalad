00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.110
Okay let's get started with
creating an S3 bucket.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.740
Go to S3 manager AWS,
this is what you should see.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.550
Click on Create Bucket, there.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.810
And give it a unique name.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.880
This can only contain lowercase letters,
hyphens, and periods separating words.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.175
Make sure to choose
a region close to you.

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:28.040
Okay, go in here and create a folder
to hold input data which is call input.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.200
Similarly, create an output
folder called output.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.380
You also need somewhere to store
mapreduce and other analysis files.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.619
Create a folder for that stuff too.

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:40.013
Okay, now that you have
somewhere to store your data,

00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:41.455
it's time to launch a cluster.

00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:43.260
Thank you editor, that's great.
