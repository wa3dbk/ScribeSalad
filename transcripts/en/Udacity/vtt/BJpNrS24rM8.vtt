00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.210
To get started,
we should first create a scripts task.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.050
However, since we want to do slightly
different things in development and

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.230
production mode.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.550
We add another task called scripts-dist,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.110
which will be used when we want to
distribute our fights for production.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.059
In the first step,
both of these tasks will look the same.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.490
We gulp source the files we need,
in this case, our JavaScript files.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.960
Then pipe them to the correct
destination, in our case,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.310
the dist/js folder.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.600
Now install the gulp-concat plug-in via
npm, and require in the gulp file, then

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.470
add a new pipe to both tasks with concat
all JS before the destination pipe.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.280
This plugin takes the files
in the stream, and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.709
combines them into a single file named
whatever you provide as the argument.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.020
Try running one of those
task in your terminal,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.170
to make sure the concatenated all.js
ends up in the correct folder.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.180
All good.
Then we're missing only one last thing.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.010
We need to change the references to the
individual js files in our index HTML to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.360
point to the single js file,
at js/all.js.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.680
And now your page should run fine again.
