00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
So let’s follow our Jersey Square team and

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.014
see what they did with customer segments.

00:00:05.014 --> 00:00:06.647
Now, what happened is, they got out of the

00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:09.794
building and this time, after they spoke to

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:12.892
a series of customers, they spoke to over 60.

00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:14.193
And what they found out was what they

00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:16.041
originally thought was a single customer

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:18.358
segment actually turned out to be there

00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:21.276
were two separate segments. It turned out

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:23.775
there were the original segment they thought,

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:26.311
rabid sports jersey owners, who were male,

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.092
13 to 35, who passionately followed their

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:31.359
team and went to a lot of games. But there

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.841
were also people who casually attended

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:35.041
games. Male and female and they kind of

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:39.848
were closer to 18-30 and they were casual fans.

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:41.565
So number one, as you can now see that

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:44.221
there are not only two customer segments,

00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:46.989
but there are two value propositions, that is,

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.486
there is a value proposition that matches

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:52.537
each one of the segments and there’s a

00:00:52.537 --> 00:00:55.893
revenue stream that matches each one of the

00:00:55.893 --> 00:00:57.624
segments. And so now you could kind of

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.191
see the power of the canvass. This is a

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:02.791
multi-sided market. You have at least two

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.465
customers segments and you have two

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.429
value props and attending revenue streams.

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.214
Now you should notice what the Jersey

00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:12.949
Square team did wonderfully, they actually

00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:14.915
started with the archetype. The archetype

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:18.095
though, if you remember is, kind of the end

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:20.312
result of understanding the pain and the

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.114
gain we were solving with the value

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:25.393
proposition. So they really were missing

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:28.776
talking about gains and pains over here as well.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:30.745
And it would have been great if they had

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:32.774
that added in, but a pretty good job in

00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:34.628
trying to understand what their archetype

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.815
was which need to match their

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:40.815
minimum viable product over here.
