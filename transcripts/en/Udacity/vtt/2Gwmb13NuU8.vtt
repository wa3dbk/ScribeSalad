00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.890
First, you really need all your features to be

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.510
available and fully usable on the mobile version. If you

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.300
try to guess what content or features your users

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.080
won't miss on the mobile, you'll probably get it wrong.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.360
It might seem logical, right up until the point

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.740
where I try to browse store inventory for my mobile

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.490
device, only to find that feature is not availbale.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.500
Secondly, with two apps or sites, there's a natural tendency

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.420
to focus on one or the other and to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.420
get out of sync between them. Maintaining two separate applications

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.970
and keeping them fundamentally the same is hard to

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.720
do. And finally, there's the problem that it's difficult to

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.080
identify when you really want the mobile version. My

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.630
tablet for example has nearly as big a screen as

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.640
my laptop, and it's actually higher resolution than my

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.700
laptop. Mobile design is actually more of a spectrum that

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.990
spans all the way from low-resolution devices up into

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.150
desktop design. At the very least, there are three

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.620
simple rules if you want to offer a mobile-only

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.510
site. First, you want to make sure a user

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.740
can still get to the full site from the mobile site if they want to, in case you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.170
forgot any features. Secondly, you should but canonical URL

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.590
in meta-information. This is commonly done for search engine optimization,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.210
but it's also important to keep your

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.510
mobile site and your desktop site together. Finally,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.430
if someone links to a specific page on

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.010
your desktop site, you shouldn't transfer them to

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.280
your top-level mobile page. You need to

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.490
transfer them to that specific page or its

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.920
equivalent, on the mobile site. It's really frustrating

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.320
when you get redirected to the top-level page.
