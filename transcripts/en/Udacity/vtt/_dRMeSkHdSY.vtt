00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.672
We know that the denominator of a fraction cannot equal 0. So, if we solve this

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:09.370
for x, we know x cannot take on the value of 4. Now, I didn't show the steps of

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.150
adding 20 to both sides and then dividing by 5, but I think that you can easily

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.950
see that if x were 4, we would get 0, which can't happen for the denominator.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.083
This idea of excluded values of x is really important. Later, when we solve

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:26.095
equations with rational expressions, we want to make sure we don't allow certain

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:30.316
values for the variable or for x. We don't want the denominators to be 0.
