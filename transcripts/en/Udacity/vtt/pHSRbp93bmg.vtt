00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.002
Let's see if we can apply our same strategies to this motion problem. In 4

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:10.130
hours Katrina can go 15 miles upriver and come back. The speed of the current

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.194
of the river is five miles per hour. What is Katrina's speed? Just like from

00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:18.061
before, we're going to set up a table to list all the information we know, and

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.490
write expressions for anything that might be missing.
