00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.950
And now we've arrived at the end of
our quest to greater productivity.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.790
You've learned how to set up
your editor to code like a pro.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.350
&gt;&gt; Got familiar with Gulp.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.012
&gt;&gt; Dramatically improved your
workflow with live editing.

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:14.840
&gt;&gt; Set up safety nets for easier
teamwork and better quality control.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.200
&gt;&gt; And optimized the crap out of
your site to ship it to your users.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.620
That was a lot, I can't believe we've
done all of that in such a short time.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.640
Be sure to grab the summary notes with
all the links to relevant downloads and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.330
projects, and happy tooling.
