00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.460
To upload wireframes, JPEGs,
or PNGs simply drag and

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.130
drop your images directly
into your browser window, or

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.670
you can simply click Browse to select
screens you would like to import.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.790
If you find yourself manually uploading
screens one by one, it may be a long and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.350
cumbersome process, so you may consider
using EnVision sync as a method for

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.500
automatically uploading screens for you.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.740
EnVision Sync can automatically detect
changes to the screens that you've saved

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.060
on a local folder on your computer, and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.560
automatically import those
into EnVision for you.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.390
The advantage of using
EnVision Sync is that you can

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.470
automatically have those screens
uploaded into EnVision so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.849
you don't have to manually upload them
each time you want to create a project.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.510
Once you've finished
uploading your screens,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.910
you'll see a thumbnail preview of all of
your screens uploaded into your project.
