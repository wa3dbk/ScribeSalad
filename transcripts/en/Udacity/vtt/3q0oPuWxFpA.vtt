Klout score is the single number that, that measure your influence across the

00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:09.178
Internet primarily the social media. I'm Chief Scientist at Klout, I run the

00:00:09.178 --> 00:00:13.013
data science team as well as the data infrastructure team oversee all the data

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.832
driven products that come, you know kind of lead the team behind the score. &gt;&gt;

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:21.837
And you created the whole infrastructure, and the algorithm behind the Klout

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:26.135
score, right? &gt;&gt; I create the infrastructure and the science behind the Klout

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:33.341
score. We grade everyone's influence on the Internet from a scale from 1 to 99.

00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:38.000
It's a single score that you can see as your credit score for you online

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.265
reputation or you know, a single score that you can measure influence with.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:48.001
Klout score is calculate by incorporating all your data from various social

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.680
networks, ranging from Twitter to Facebook, to LinkedIn. And for each network, I

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.433
would collect about a hundred signals. Number of retweets you get per twwet,

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:05.077
number of likes you get per post on Facebook stuff like that are all the signals

00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:10.878
that we look at overall we consifer four hundred signals per person. And we

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:16.698
generally scores for 400 million and more users at everyday. Klout score follows

00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:23.278
this by model distribution, where you have this very big peak of users who are

00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:29.576
in this 40 to 60s on this side and also the users who are quality content

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:35.163
producers. And you also have this very nice peak of users on the other side who

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:40.428
are the consumers of those content. And if you, you know, plot the score, and

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:45.321
the number of users with each score buckets from this side to this side. You

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:49.930
know, this is zero, and that's 99. And this, you know, the y axis is the number

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.536
of users who are in this buckets. You can see a very nice by model distribution

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:58.635
there. The average cost score is lower than the median because they are

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:03.531
proportionally more people with a lower score, so they drag the average down. So

00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:07.799
in such a distribution, taking a look at the median makes more sense. Being able

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.390
to beat forty is actually a pretty good sign of being very influential on the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.150
social media.
