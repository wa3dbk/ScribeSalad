00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.400
NAT allows multiple networks to reuse the

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.750
same private IP address space. Let's suppose that

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.970
we have two networks. These networks might

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.220
be, for example, homes or they might be

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.090
larger networks in regions of the Internet,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.690
where IPv4 address space is scarce, for example,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.490
in developing regions. What NAT allows these networks

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.490
to do is reuse the same portion of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.910
internet address space. For example, a particular, special, private IP address

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.978
space, is 192.168/16. Other private IP address space

00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:41.118
is specified in RFC 3130. Now, obviously these two networks couldn't

00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:43.974
coexist on the public Internet, because routers

00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:46.490
wouldn't know if they got a packet destined

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.550
for an IP address in this space, which network the packet should be sent to.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.690
What a NAT, or a Network Address

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.920
Translator does, is take the private IP addresses

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.150
that are behind the NAT and translate those

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.160
IP addresses to a single, globally visible IP

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.910
address. Now, to the rest of the Internet, network one appears to be reachable

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.140
by a single IP address, 203.178.1.1, and network two is reachable

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.820
via a single distinct global IP

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.155
address 133.4.1.5. Now, a host back here, say

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:26.790
192.168.1.10 might send a packet towards a global

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.090
internet destination. Now, the key behind NAT is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.810
that this packet has a source port and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.000
the NAT is basically going to take that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.590
source IP address and port and it's going to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.860
translate it into a publicly reachable source IP

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.830
address and port, and the destination will remain

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.360
the same. That packet will make its way

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.540
to a global destination and the reply will make

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.190
its way to the globally reachable IP address on

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.880
the corresponding port. Now, when that packet with that

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.040
particular destination IP address and port reaches the NAT,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.930
the NAT has a table that knows the mapping

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.620
between that public IP address and port and the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.060
private one that it rewrote to generate the corresponding

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.008
public IP address and port. So we can

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.900
simply now rewrite the destination IP address of this

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.690
packet to the corresponding private address and port. NATs

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.060
are popular on broadband access networks, small or home

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.395
offices and VPNs. There's a clear savings in

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:29.230
IPv4 address space, since there can be many many

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.870
devices in one of these private networks and yet

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.170
all of the devices that are behind the NAT

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.010
only use up one public IP Address. The drawback,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040
of course, is that the end to end model is

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.810
broken. And we talked about the end to end

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.320
model in a previous lesson and let me just remind

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.215
you how NAT breaks it. If the NAT device

00:02:47.215 --> 00:02:51.190
failed in this instance, for example, the mapping between the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.470
private source IP address and port and the public source

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.420
IP address and port would be lost. Thereby breaking all

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.500
active connections for which the NAT is on

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.270
the path. It's also asymmetric. Under ordinary circumstances

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.730
it's rather difficult for a host on the global Internet to reach a device in a

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.060
private address space in network one or network

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.060
two, because by default those devices in these

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.290
private networks do not have public globally reachable

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.490
IP addresses. So, NAT both breaks end-to-end communication and

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.330
it also breaks by directional communication.
