00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.985
What heuristics tell us about human
thought and decision making is that

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:08.658
they're quick and efficient, and therefore
they're adaptive in everyday life.

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:11.184
They allow us to make decisions
such as whether or not we should

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:14.294
jump out of the way of that
moving car to save our lives.

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:19.448
However, heuristics can also lead
to biased decision and estimate making,

00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:22.108
and unfortunately we see
that humans are not as rational

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:23.904
as we would like to think we are.
