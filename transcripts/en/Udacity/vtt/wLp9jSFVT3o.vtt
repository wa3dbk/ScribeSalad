What breadth first search does is it always expands out in levels.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So h expands into i and j, one and the other first, and then one of the other of these

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
has expanded but with only one level, and before we go any deeper, 3 has nodes,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
j's nodes get expanded next, and only after everything distance 2

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
away from h has been expanded, will o all get its chance.
