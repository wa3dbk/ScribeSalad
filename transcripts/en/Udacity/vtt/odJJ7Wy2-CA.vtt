00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:01.090
Creating a watch face for

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.655
Android Wear is an exercise centered
around visualizing time clearly.

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:07.700
It's quite different than designing
an Android user interface.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.990
Android Wear devices provide a unique
way to reimagine the ways in which we

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.890
tell time.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.510
Android Wear also let's you integrate
data on watch interfaces for

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.010
a high level of personalization and
contextual relevance.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.550
These are powerful tools
to create watch faces, but

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.940
they also run the risk of over
complicating your design.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.590
The most successful watch face designs
take advantage of these advanced

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.720
capabilities, but deliver
information clearly and elegantly.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.000
Glancability is the single most
important principle to consider when

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.740
creating a watch face design.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.390
Your watch face design should clearly
show time and any related data.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.980
Experiment with bold, minimal and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.630
expressive designs that are highly
readable at a distance.
