00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:04.511
And the correct answer is the second and third options.

00:00:04.511 --> 00:00:07.793
The first one is not true. Alice can determine the key using

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:12.093
the typical Diffie-Hellman protocol as discussed in the Unit 3

00:00:12.093 --> 00:00:14.860
by taking the value G to the power Y and raising

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.528
it to the power X. The fourth option is not true; adding the

00:00:18.528 --> 00:00:21.483
hash to the message actually increases the size of it.

00:00:21.483 --> 00:00:24.009
To see whether second and third options are true, let’s take

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.997
a look at what could happen without including the hash.

00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:29.833
So Alice picks the value X, calculates G of X and

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.453
encrypts G of X with Bob’s public key. She then tries to send

00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:36.944
this to Bob. Now, you could intercept the message, then

00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:39.865
send a different value to Bob, Bob recalculate the key,

00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:43.579
G of X prime Y. Bob would then send G of Y which Mallory

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.343
could intercept and send a new value to Alice.

00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:49.510
Alice would then calculate a non-sense key and have no

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.170
idea that the key she has calculated is worthless. Adding the

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.985
hash value of the key to this protocol allows Alice to verify

00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:58.800
that she has a valid key that came from Bob and not

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.000
from some attacker in the middle.
