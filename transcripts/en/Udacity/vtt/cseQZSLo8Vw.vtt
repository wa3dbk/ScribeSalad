00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.900
Let's start with Medium.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.980
As the page gets larger,
we can see that the text reflows.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.330
That's good, but
that's not a breakpoint.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.370
But, once the viewport is wide enough,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.100
we see that the images got larger and,
so did the text.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.850
That's a breakpoint.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.380
Once the viewport is this wide,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.680
we can see that there's now
a margin on this side of the page.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.780
That is another break point, so
in the medium.com example I noticed two

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.160
break points in the men with max
width example we start off and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.390
the page says no,
then it gets a little bit larger and

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.940
the page says yes, but
if we get to big it goes back to no.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.040
So, this means that the course
example also has two break points.
