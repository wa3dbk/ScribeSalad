00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.819
So when you look at tools for

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.059
email automation,
there are several platforms you can use.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.230
A lot of start ups use send
grid which is a real cheap and

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.240
effective way to send lots
of emails that are custom.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.280
And you don't have to get into a lot
of heavy architecture installation

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.560
to get it done, it can get up and
running pretty quickly.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.149
When you get bigger and become a larger
company you can go to things like

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.060
responses Marketo That are much larger,
much heavier integration.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.560
They allow a lot of other things that
will let you do targeting, re-targeting,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.890
segmentation that SENDGRID won't do.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.967
So it really depends on where you
are in your company's life cycle and

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:30.252
how many emails you do have.

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:33.372
One of the best ways to generate an
email list is to get them to engage with

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:35.140
your contacts on their own.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.970
If you do that, there's already a level
of trust they've given you because

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.870
they've said I like your product, I
like your content, I like your company.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.780
If you don't do that and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.360
you go and purchase a list, there's
a high likelihood they're probably

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.510
not going to customers that
are in your target segment.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.560
They're going to unsubscribe and

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.450
you're going to be wasting your time and
your money.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.090
So there are several ways you can get
someone to subscribe to your website.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.126
Usually when you come to a blog,
like www.ask-you.com/blog.

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:56.854
What we do is we pop up a little box and

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:59.000
it says want to hear
more from us click here.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.230
And it's really an email address and
a submit button.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.150
It's clean, it's simple, and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.504
it's a great way to get them to
continue to engage with your content.

00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:07.350
Another way is when you have a sign up
process again that you'd ask the one

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580
thing we do is you have to sign up for
our content and for our courses.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.700
So to consume a course you have
to give us an email address,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.020
your first name, and last name.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.460
That allows us to understand
what you're interested in and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.340
communicate with you just about
the topics that you want to hear from.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.950
So the biggest component
of email marketing that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.870
marketers need to realize is the fact
that when someone gives you your email,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.390
they're trusting you with that.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.280
It's a very personal thing,
it's very similar to your phone.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.420
So you're letting someone contact
you whenever they want to.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.780
You've established a bond and
trust with that customer.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870
You will break that trust
by over emailing them or

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.660
quote unquote spamming them.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.300
What you really don't want to do is hit
them too often with the wrong message.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.460
You will increase that trust and
they will talk about you and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.410
refer you to other people
if you actually maintain

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.820
a good relationship with them and send
them emails they want when they want.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.520
The more you send them things they don't
want, the higher likelihood they'll

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.250
unsubscribe from what you do and
not talk with you ever again.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.420
There's a great example of this if
you look at the emails I've gotten

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.470
recently from Apple.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.350
They really only send you something
when a new proctor feature is announced,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.170
which is great because I don't see
400 emails from Apple in my stream.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.070
Another example is a consumer grades
company where I get emails from them

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.150
probably daily.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.030
I subscribed once but i never subscribed
to get something from them everyday.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910
It took me about three,
four weeks before I gave up on them and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.500
I don't subscribe anywhere else.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.840
Email marketing is a set of activities
that you take to engage with your

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.340
audience to get to come to your site
directly, these are things like

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.690
blog posts, social posts,
things on Facebook,LinkedIn and Twitter.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.220
That you engage directly
with your audience and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.740
get them to come to your site.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.000
You really don't want to send the same
person the same message multiple times.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.860
The best thing to do is
to create a theme or

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.580
a message that relates to a certain
thing you're trying to promote.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.440
And make that custom.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.630
So for example when you
talk about Fourth of July.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.210
You know messaging around that holiday.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.730
That would promote your product in
conjunction with what's happening

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.770
at the time.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.700
Timely messages are extremely important
in getting someone to read it.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.260
The more timely your message is there's
a higher likely that them actually

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.210
opening your email and
engaging with your product and company.
