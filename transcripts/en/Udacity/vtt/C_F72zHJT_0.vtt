00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So in the solution to this problem set, we've added a for loop whose index

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
ranges from 0 to the number of steps.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We put the number of steps plus 1 as the argument for range

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because i will go up to the number inside minus 1.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Inside the loop, we've created a variable called angle, which is equal to 2π times the index

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
divided by the number of steps that are taken in the trajectory.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Have you look over this picture. You can sort of see what's happening.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The moon starts in this position, then after 1 time step,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's into this position and so on and so forth.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The number of segments will equal the number of steps

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the number of lines will equal the number of steps plus 1.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
After this, we use the array x to define the horizontal

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and vertical positions of the moon at any given time step.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's at this point that we have to remember our trigonometric functions--sine and cosine.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In this first line right here, we're defining the horizontal position of x for the i-the timestep.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In the second line, which is a sine, is what's going to show us the vertical position.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is one of those cases where being able to see a right triangle in this picture is very helpful.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Looking at our picture, this horizontal line right here that extends from the earth out to the moon's orbit

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is the 0 radian or the 0 degree line.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're measuring all of the angles that the moon is going to be marked at up from this line.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That means that at any given moment, we can draw a line from the moon down to this horizontal line

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to create a right triangle, which will then allow us to use sine and cosine in conjunction with this angle

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to determine the moon's vertical and horizontal distance from the earth.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Going back to our code, after all of these is filled in, if we run the program,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
we end up with a perfect circle, just like we were hoping to get

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
for the trajectory of the moon around the earth in this ideal simulation.
