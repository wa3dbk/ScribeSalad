00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
In this problem, we'll return the spaceship, so I'm very excited.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.080
Now, similar to what we saw in units 1 and 2, we want our spaceship in this case

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.010
or it's actually a satellite to get into orbit.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.400
However, this is a very special type of orbit. It's a geostationary orbit.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.890
What this means is that once the satellite is in space at a certain distance away from the earth,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.200
it will orbit the earth at exactly the same rate as that at which the earth rotates.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.210
So the people on earth, it's going to look like this satellite isn't moving at all, which is pretty cool.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.240
To show you how this happens, we have this lovely diagram right here,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.930
which I warned you is not to scale.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.090
In the center, we have the earth, and initially, the satellite is orbiting

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.820
at just 200 km away from the Earth's surface.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.040
At a certain moment, in fact, at the moment when the rocket first crosses the x axis on this diagram,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.040
the rocket is going to spit the satellite out, and this is going to repel the satellite away

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.970
from its original orbit and eventually out to the radius that needs to be at for geostationary orbit

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.550
so this red line right here then it's going to stay along this red path for as long as it needs to.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.170
Now, the radius of geostationary orbit is 42,164 km.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.560
Also, just an interesting tidbit, this transition orbit, this green curve right here,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.410
is exactly half of an ellipse that is tangent to both of these circular orbits, the pink one and the red one.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.290
Also, these orbits are both perfectly circular even though my drawing doesn't really show that.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.710
So there are three tasks that we would like you to complete for this problem.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.440
The first of these is to find out what the speed and radius of that initial smaller orbit is.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.300
Remember, like I said, this is a circular orbit so that should make things a little bit simpler.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.770
You probably have to use pencil and paper for this part of the problem.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.090
Now, on the rocket and the satellite attached to it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.110
cross the negative part of the x axis for the first time.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.470
The rocket fires its engine to increase the speed of the satellite

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.160
by the amount given in the variable called boost.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.570
This should remind you a lot at the last problem of unit 2.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.630
So for your second task, we want you to figure out how to make this boost happen

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.510
and of course how to make it happen at the appropriate time.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.700
Let's go back a bit in the code to get your last task.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.780
This is going to be to figure out as you've done before.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.120
What the correct magnitude of the boost velocity is?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.350
We filled a dummy value of 42 just to sort out with,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.210
and I've given you several different options to choose from.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.470
One of these is the correct answer.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.520
Once you completed the first two tasks, plug in each of these values for boost

00:02:35.520 --> 09:59:59.000
and compare the path to see which one helps the satellite and the geostationary orbit.
