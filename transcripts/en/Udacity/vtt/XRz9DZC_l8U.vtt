00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.510
Let's now talk about the implementation of clustered

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.390
objects. Given an object reference, there is a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.224
data structure in the operating system called the

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:12.000
translation table and the translation table maps an

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.650
object reference to a representation in memory. So,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.850
when you have an object reference presented to

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.140
the operating system that can pointed to the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.110
particular representation. Remember that the reference itself is common,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.420
the same object reference may be pointing to this replica

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.479
on a particular processor, a different replica on a different

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.580
processor, and so on. That's a function of the translation

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.970
table, so on each CPU, this is what happens. When

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.140
an object reference is presented, the operating system converts it

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.380
to a representation. And this is a normal operation. Now,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.400
you present an object reference but that object reference may

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400
not be in the translation table yet, because this object

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.040
has not been referenced so far. In that

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.590
case, you'll have a miss in looking up the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.910
translation table. And if a miss happens, then

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.960
there is another data structure in the operating system

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.090
called the miss handling table. And the miss

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.490
handling table is a mapping between the object reference

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.260
that you are presenting and the handler that

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.800
the operating system has for dealing with this missing

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.170
object reference. Because if an object reference is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.190
missing, then the operating system has to find some

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.505
way to make this reference point to a

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:27.990
representation. So that's the focus of this object miss

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.170
handler. What this object miss handler does is

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.800
it knows the particular representation for this reference. And

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.470
it is also going to make a decision.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.320
Should this object reference point to a representation that

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.840
is already existing or should it create a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.270
new representation for it? All of those decisions are

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.120
going to be taken by this object miss handler.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.470
Once it takes the decision, it creates a representation

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.450
for this object reference and it installs the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.550
mapping between this object reference and this representation in

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.890
the translation table. So that subsequently, when you present

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.620
the object reference, it'll go to the particular representation

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.620
for that particular object reference. So that's the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.830
work done by the object miss handler. And,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.840
so this happens on every translation miss. And

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.390
the object reference is locally resolved in this case

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.990
because the object miss handler is locally available

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.120
and it can handle that. But it can happen

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.480
that the object miss handler is not available

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.060
locally. Now how will that happen? Well, the idea

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.640
is that the miss handling table itself is

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.350
not a replicated data structure. It's a partitioned

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.550
data structure. Remember that all of these are

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.980
things that are being done under the cover

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.650
to implement the idea of a clustered object.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.740
So, if you think about the region object

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.050
that we talked about. The region object is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.500
something that is not going to be accessed

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.610
on every processor because, depending on the threads

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.720
that are executing in a particular region, those

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.370
are the threads that need to access the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.120
region object. And therefore, this miss handling table is

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.380
a partition data structure that contains the mapping

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.810
between object references and the miss handlers that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.520
correspond to those object references. So in this

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.900
particular example that I give you, the miss handling

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.960
table happens to contain the miss handler for

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.790
this particular object reference. It is possible that

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.520
when an object referenced is presented in a

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.820
particular processor, the object miss handler is not local,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.070
because the miss handling table is a partitioned

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.800
data structure. What happens in that case? Well,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.920
that's why you have a notion of a global miss handler, and the idea here is if

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.400
the miss handling table does not have

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.240
the miss handler for that particular object reference,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.950
then you go to a global miss handler. This is something that is replicated on

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.610
every node. Every node has its global

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.200
miss handler. And this global miss handler knows

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.570
exactly the partitioning of the miss handling table.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.990
So it knows, how this miss handler table

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.209
has been partitioned and distributed on all the nodes

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.560
of the multi-processer. And so, if an object reference is

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.250
presented on a node, the translation table will say, well,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.360
you know, this particular object reference, we don't know how

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.880
to resolve it because the object miss handler doesn't

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.720
exist here. And therefore, we're going to go to this

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.630
global miss handler. And the global miss handler, because it

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.260
is replicated on every node, it says, oh, I know

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.180
exactly which node has the miss handling table

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.160
that corresponds to this object reference. And so it

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.030
can go to that node. And from that node it can obtain a replica, and once it

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.530
obtains a replica, it can populate it in

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.140
the translation table for this particular node. And once

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.300
it populates it, then we are back in

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.260
business again, as in this case. So, the function

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.730
of the global miss handler is to resolve the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.120
location of the object miss handler for a particular

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.120
object reference i. So given an object reference i,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.870
if you have no way of resolving it locally,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.330
then the global miss handler that is present on

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.540
every node can tell you the location of the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.290
object miss handler for this particular object, so that

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.530
he can resolve that reference, get the replica for it,

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.710
install it locally, populate the translation table,

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.780
then you're back in business again. So what

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.620
this workflow is telling you is how incrementally

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.630
the Tornado system can optimize the implementation of

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.720
the objects. So depending on the usage pattern,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.390
it can make a determination that I used

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.490
to have a single replica, it is now

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.790
accessed on multiple nodes. Maybe I should really

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.060
replicate it on multiple nodes. So that's a decision that can be taken

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.490
during the running of the system on the usage pattern of the different objects.
