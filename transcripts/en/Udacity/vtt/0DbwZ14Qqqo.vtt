00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.250
In this lesson, you learned how to create reports and

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.939
charts and dashboards. And really to wrap that all up

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.700
in a nutshell, you learned how to present data visually,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.420
to people in a way that they can understand it.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.290
Dashboards especially allow you to see exactly what you want to

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.550
see, when you want to see it, where you want to see

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.410
it. In the next lesson, you're going to learn how

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.060
to automate manual tasks using workflow rules and approval processes.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.630
It's going to be a lot of fun. See you there.
