Now let's go back to the individual. So just how is it that we're able to

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:08.740
develop language? We see that children have the ability to understand words

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.894
before they develop the ability to produce words. Do you remember from lesson

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:18.066
three that the Wernicke's area is in the left hemisphere of the brain? And this

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:22.200
is where language comprehension occurs. In the Broca's area, which is also in

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.228
the left hemisphere of the brain, is associated with language production. Now,

00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:32.002
because infants can understand language before they can produce it, this

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:38.830
suggests that the Wernicke's area may develop earlier than the Broca's area.
