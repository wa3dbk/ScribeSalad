00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.719
You probably got this one right. The right answer is that

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.330
this is a people mistake. And despite the fact that this is

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.550
an easy answer, I just want to make sure to stress

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.800
once more. Because this is a very classic mistake. And one that

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.070
can have dire consequences. You should never add people, to a

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.430
late project. Because in 99.9% of the cases, that's only going to make

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.390
things worse. Why? Because these people have to be brought up to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.590
speed, and also because having more also makes the communication more difficult,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.690
the meetings more difficult and so on. So in

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.980
short, do not add people to a late project.
