00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.830
With a math background
we can now describe

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.410
some of the most widely
used public key algorithms.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.370
The first is RSA.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.833
Named after its inventors.

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:14.250
R backup RSA is

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.860
the most widely used public key
algorithm and one of the very first.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.450
RSA supports both public key
encryption and digital signature.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.600
The security strength of RSA is
based on the hypothesis that,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.040
factoring a very large number into
two primes is a very hard problem.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.510
This is, given a large number

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.700
it is computationally very hard
to factor it into two primes.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.560
RSA can support variable key lengths.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.833
In practice, most people use
a key length of 1,024 bits,

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.233
or 2,048 bits, or even 4,096 bits.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:57.190
The plaintext length
can also be variable.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.300
In RSA,
every data is treated as an integer

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.620
because we can interpret any data with
bits of one and zero as an integer.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.426
And the requirement here is that
the plaintext input has to be smaller in

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:13.960
integer value than the key.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.720
The size of ciphertext is
the same as the key length.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.040
This summarizes the RSA algorithm.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.690
The first step is key generation.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.230
First we select two prime numbers,
p and q.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.090
Say each of them are at
least 512 bits long.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.790
And then we compute p times q.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.950
The result's n.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.262
And while we have p and
q we also compute totient n.

00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:45.190
Which is p minus one times q minus one
because both p and q are prime numbers.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.110
Then we select an integer e that
is relatively prime to totient n.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.720
After we have selected e,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.990
we find the multiplicative
inverse of e marked totient n.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.260
Having computed n, e and d,
now we can forget about p and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.880
q and forget about totient n.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.930
The public key is e and n.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.830
The private key, which we have to keep
to ourself and secure it, is d and n.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.710
Now for encryption, suppose Alice
has published her public key.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.760
And Bob wishes to send a message,
M, to Alice.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.520
And he wants only Alice
to be able to read M.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.520
So Bob obtains Alice's public key and
to encrypt message M,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.350
Bob computes M raised to
the power of e (mod n).

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.285
For decryption on receipt
of this ciphertext, C,

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:45.414
Alice will use her own private key,
D, and

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:49.700
compute C raised to
the power of d (mod n).

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.067
And this would result in
the original plaintext M.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.940
The property of RSA guarantees
that only Alice Can decrypt this

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.660
message because only
she has the private key

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.010
that's paired with the public key
that was used to encrypt the message.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.620
Again, every user can publish his or
her own public key and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.657
keep his or her own private key
securely to himself or herself.

00:03:16.657 --> 00:03:23.330
To encrypt message to a user say, Alice,
Bob would obtain Alice's public key and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.930
compute the ciphertext by raising
the plaintext to the power of e mod n.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.570
To decrypt,
Alice would use her own private key

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.190
to raise the ciphertext to
the power of d and then mod n.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.820
What about creating digital signature?

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.160
Alice will use her own private key

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.374
to raise the message m
to a power of d mod n.

00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:48.440
To verify,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.620
Bob would get Alice's public key, raise
the signature to a power of e and mod n,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.800
and this will produce the original
message m and verify the signature.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.310
Again here the property
of RSA guarantees that

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.780
Bob will know that the signature
was created by Alice,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.670
because only she has the private key
that is paired with the public key

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.610
that Bob was able to use
to verify the signature.
