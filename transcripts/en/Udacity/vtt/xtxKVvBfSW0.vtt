Playing with picture objects in BlueJ is kind of fun. Let me make a couple of

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.240
picture objects. If you look carefully how I constructed the last object, I

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.320
filled in the name of the file here. And I'll do it one more time like that. If

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.920
you do it in this way, you also have to tell the program to draw the objects by

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.070
selecting the draw method. The first picture appears, and a second picture

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.720
appears. That looks kind of horrible. Let's have a closer look on how we can

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.118
make this look nicer. First of all, let's move the rocket a little bit, and

00:00:34.118 --> 00:00:48.280
let's make the red planet a bit smaller. Well, that's much nicer. But it's a

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.390
bit tedious to do this with your hands and with clicking and clicking, that's

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.320
where programming comes in. Here I've written a program that does the same

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.640
actions, that you've just seen me do by clicking in a java program, a step at a

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.500
time. We'll understand all of the details pretty soon, but let me show you the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.329
basic lay of the land. We're making a picture out of the mariner4 image, we're

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:20.950
translating it, we're drawing it, we're making another picture object, we're

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.570
shrinking it and we're drawing it, and that composes the picture. Now when you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.230
operate in this way, you make an object and then you later need to do something

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.180
to that object. And it's, it's in a program here, it's not in the BlueJ work

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.220
bench. And then it becomes very important to give names to each of the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.194
pictures. You'll notice I call this one rocket. I call this one planet. Those

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:51.900
names are names of variables, and that what we're want to discuss next.
