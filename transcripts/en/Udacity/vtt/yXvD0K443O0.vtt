Okay. Time to draw the square. But this time,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.520
using the computer. So, I created a new Python

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.560
file and called it mindstorms.py. You could've called it

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.110
something else. And then, inside it, I created a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.170
function called draw_square, which, for now, is empty. Now,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.090
I know there is this module in Python called

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.600
turtle. This is the actual thing that moves around

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.020
and draws stuff on the computer. By the way,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.900
I encourage you to find out why this thing

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.450
is called turtle and not a dog, or a cat.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.230
One way to start to draw is by saying, turtle.Turtle.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.070
Now, this syntax is a little weird and we will

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.510
understand it by the end of this video, but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.400
it suffices to say that this is how we grab

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.870
out turtle. I will call it brad. Now, the first

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.110
thing we want to do is move brad forward. And we

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.040
can use the forward function for that. This function takes in

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.220
a number, which is the distance we want to move forward.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.420
Now, I just want to run this code, and see if it's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.150
even working. But, you know what, the one thing we forgot,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.510
is that we still don't have a screen on which this

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.430
turtle, aka brad, is going to move around. In other words,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.770
we need the red carpet equivalent in our program. I know

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.300
that is done by adding a window screen, and this window is

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.200
going to have a red background, and I want to be able to close

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.230
this window any time I click on it. Now, let's save and run this program.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.270
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.510
All right. It seems that we have a window with a red background. And a turtle

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.980
named brad, which has moved 100 steps forward. Okay, so I am back at the code,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.770
and now I'm going to finish making the square. So, after brad has moved 100

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.890
steps forward, I want to turn it right, and I want to do so by 90 degrees. So, I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.300
can say, brad.right 90, and because I want to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.180
do these two steps right here, four times to draw a square, I'll just

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.940
copy paste them a few times. So, I'm going to copy these two lines

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.422
and I'm going to paste them. Second time,

00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:11.630
third time, fourth time Let me save and run,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.150
alright, it seems like we have our first square.
