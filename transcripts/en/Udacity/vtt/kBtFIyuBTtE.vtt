00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.790
In order to find the y intercept. We need to know the slope of the line and a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.530
point that it goes through. Let's say that the line goes through this point

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.740
right here. Then there's only one possible y intercept that this line could

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.450
have. Such that it has this slope and goes through this point. The y-intercept

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.328
would be here. So, therefore, all we need is a point on the regression line. We

00:00:25.328 --> 00:00:30.820
already found the standard deviation of x, and we also already have all of the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.400
data values.
