We know that 70% of Udacity students are aged 30 or less. That means that the

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:11.123
probability of selecting a random student aged 30 or less is 70% or 0.7. That's

00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:16.779
why this is called the probability density function. The area under this curve

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.153
represents the probability. See how we can visually model statistical concepts?

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:24.215
It's so cool!
