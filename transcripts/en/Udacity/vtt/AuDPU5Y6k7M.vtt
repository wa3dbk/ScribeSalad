00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.772
Okay, let's prepare to look
at the actual methods.

00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:06.395
You remember the textField should
change characters and range method.

00:00:06.395 --> 00:00:09.504
Notice that the first
perimeter of the methods

00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:13.579
in the textField delegate was
always the textField itself.

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.648
It will be the same in
the tableViews two protocols,

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:20.647
notice that the tableView method
has an argument named indexPath.

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:24.838
This is a struct with two members,
row and section.

00:00:24.838 --> 00:00:28.138
By the way, for more on structs,
see the instructor notes or

00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:30.873
peak ahead into the Swift
section in lesson five.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:33.049
When the table wants to get the cell for

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:35.837
a particular row,
it invokes a method asking for

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:39.928
the cell and it passes in an indexPath
object with the row property set.

00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:44.283
Similarly, when a table wants to alert
its delegate that a row was selected.

00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:46.721
It invokes the appropriate method and

00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:50.387
passes in an indexPath object
with the row property set.

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:54.225
Remember, we're interested in the
following three questions that the table

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:54.755
will ask.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.062
How many rows?

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:57.565
What is the cell for each row?

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:00.154
And what should happen
when a cell is selected?

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:03.440
Which method signatures
corresponds to these questions?
