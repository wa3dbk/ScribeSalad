00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.719
Couple other little things
about point clouds.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.080
One is, wi, the point clouds, of course,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.860
are sampled from the surface
that this depth sensor hits.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.980
So you're, what you're getting is,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.120
you're getting a sampling
of the surfaces,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.680
which means there are no volumes.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.630
You have to infer a volume, right?

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.810
So even if there's a nice
sphere right here,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.490
you're going to get points along its
surface, and maybe if you move around,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.110
you'll get more points from the surface,
but it's up to fut,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.680
further processing to decide,
oh, that's the spherical volume.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.670
So there's no explicit
representation of volumes.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.020
There is an interesting element to it,
and that has to do with surface normals.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.520
So, I assume you all know what a surface
normal is, you've got Geometry.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.100
So the idea is you've got
some underlying surface, and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.220
at any given point,
you can fit the tangent plane, and

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.590
the normal to that plane, that's
referred to as the surface normal.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.160
You can think of it as a first order
local approximation to the surface.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.410
Point clouds actually
have surface normals.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.530
And you might ask how is that possible.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.860
&gt;&gt; How is that possible?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.880
&gt;&gt; Well, because it actually,
the sensor, it does a variety of little

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.090
processing to try to find little local
points nearby and fit that tangent plane

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.390
in order to estimate the surface normal,
and sometimes you, that's useful.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.010
I will tell you that the surface
normal representation

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.000
is less robust than the actual
location of the point itself.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.844
So, this cute little needle diagram,
in order to fit them, you have

00:01:28.844 --> 00:01:32.936
to essentially take a little Gaussian
around the, the points that are there,

00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:36.222
fit a little tangent plane to
those Gaussian weighted points,

00:01:36.222 --> 00:01:39.458
and then that gives you,
an estimate of service normal.

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:42.570
You know, you have to figure out how
big a Gaussian do you want to use,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.145
is a little bit like how big
a Gaussian do we use when we take

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:46.833
an image gradient, remember that?

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.403
We used to have to smooth out
the image to get rid of the noise, but

00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:52.370
the more you smooth it,
the more you've spread out the gradient?

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.240
Same thing is true here.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.330
The more, the more points you consider,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.021
the more smoothly the surface
normal will vary.
