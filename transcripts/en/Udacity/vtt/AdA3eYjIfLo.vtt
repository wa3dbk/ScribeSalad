00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.738
You've just practiced with Sara how to find the public interface of another

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:08.386
class, now let's go back to our car class. We had discovered the public

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:13.240
interface that you see over here and now our goal is to implement it. So

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.834
imagine a car object and let's have a look at the add gas method. We're adding

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:21.254
a certain amount of gas and what should that do to the car. Well, remember,

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.956
it's not a real car and it's not real gas. This car is just an object in a

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:29.670
computer, and it remembers some information. In particular, in order to add

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.660
gas, the car needs to remember how much gas it has. In Java, you use variables

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.365
to remember anything. And here's is how you write such a variable, a variable

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:42.704
has a name just like the variables that you've seen in the previous lesson as

00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:47.704
well as a type. And then there is this key word private here that simply means

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:52.495
that the variables of an object are a part of the private implementation. The

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:56.043
programmer who uses the public interface doesn't need to know about that. You

00:00:56.043 --> 00:00:59.760
will always want to declare instance variables as private. Let me tell you why

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.805
they're called instance variables. Let's have a look at another car object, or

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:08.176
as we say, another instance of the car class. Of course, it also needs to

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:12.046
remember how much gas it has. And the amount of gas that this object has will

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:17.043
be different from the amount of gas of the other object. So each of these

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:20.103
objects, or each of these instances of the car class needs to have its own

00:01:20.103 --> 00:01:24.303
variable to store that information. That's what it means to be an instance

00:01:24.303 --> 00:01:28.709
variable. It's a variable that occurs in every instance of the class. Now

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.980
there's another thing that each car object should remember, namely its mileage.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.792
Here's how you can define the variable, we give it a name, miles driven. It's

00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:41.179
type, it's again a number. And once again, each instance of the car class has

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.496
its own value, so it needs its own copy of that variable. These are the two

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:50.060
instance variables that we need for the car class. You will soon see how the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.794
methods of the car class update or read those instance variables. But first, go

00:01:54.794 --> 00:01:58.250
ahead and practice with Sarah how to discover the instance variables that we

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.560
need for the person class.
