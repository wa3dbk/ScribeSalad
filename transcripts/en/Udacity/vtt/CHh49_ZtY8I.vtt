00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One of the things we keep asking our startups to think about is

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
how big is this opportunity?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That's just a fancy word for saying when you're all done

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you're spending the next couple years in the startup

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
are you going to make a million, or are you going to make a billion?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That is, how potentially large is the opportunity?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so what we really want to do is do what we call

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a market and opportunity analysis.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What you've already put together is a business model canvas

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
with your hypothesis that says, "Look, we're really passionate about

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
this product or service, and we think there's a set of customers out there,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we've put together a revenue model, our first hypotheses

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and saying we're going to make a lot of money," and that's great,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but there's really kind of a method to this madness,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and there's not only one way to do this,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but this is the way we kind of think of it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You want to identify who your customers and markets are,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and you have, but you now want to size the market,

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
look at competitors, and figure out whether this market could grow.
