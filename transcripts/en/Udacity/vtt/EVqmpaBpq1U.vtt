There are three x intercepts. Which we can see are the points a, c, and e. Now,

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:08.064
remember that a function is said to be increasing if its slope is positive.

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:12.354
Because that means that the y values, or the values of the function, the output,

00:00:12.354 --> 00:00:16.603
are continuing to increase in value. And the graph goes from having a positive

00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:21.500
slope to having a negative slope. At the point b. That's the point of transition

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.708
from the function increasing, to the function decreasing. And the function

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:30.158
continues to decrease, until point d. At which point it switches from decreasing

00:00:30.158 --> 00:00:32.232
to increasing. Awesome job.
