00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.780
Companies can be large or small.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.330
They can be in different fields,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.900
manufacturing, agriculture,
transportation, education, finance.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.960
No two companies are the same, but

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.950
there are a couple of things that
can be said about any company.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.040
First, every company has customers
with a problem to be solved.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.140
Even animal shelters and
government agencies have customers.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.350
Maybe you work on a team that works
only with internal customers,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.220
other company teams.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.260
Second, companies solve problems by
providing some kind of product or

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.470
service.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.820
A cosmetics company makes hair products
to solve the problem of bed hair.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.199
A beverage company makes an energy
drink to combat tiredness.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.860
An education company creates online
courses to close the skills gap.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.970
A tech company creates a game engine for
mobile games to eliminate boredom.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.280
Companies identify problems,
come up with solutions,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.610
implement their ideas and
then deliver products to customers.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.960
So you can think of it as a cycle that
starts and ends with the customer.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.220
The challenge is to build a high
quality, cost effective and reliable

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.140
solution that you can put in the hands
of your customer as soon as possible.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.830
It's important to be in alignment
on your overall company goal.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.150
When development teams are rewarded for
launching new features quickly but

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.690
operations is rewarded for

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.050
keeping things stable, you have
the potential for conflict across teams.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.480
When you realize that the real goal
is to deliver good service to your

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.400
customers, teams are more likely to
work together to find a solution.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.590
To do this,
you have to understand your customers.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.850
Are you working for external or
internal customers?

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.500
If you're a part of
a large organization,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.240
who are the internal
people who use your work?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.020
What is the main problem that your
company or division is trying to solve?
