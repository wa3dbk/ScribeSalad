00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.280
Here's an outline of my answer and
again I'll build it up piece by piece.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.180
The first part is similar to what
we did for duplicating a string.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.090
We first write a blank
to the second tape.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.040
Then we copy the first part
of our input string to it.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.600
The x part.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.280
And then we rewind the second tape.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.870
We can illustrate this idea like this.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.660
We started by copying x
from Tape 1 to Tape 2.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.270
And positioned the head on
Tape 1 at the start of y,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.640
that is the text we want to search in.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.240
And then we rewound the head on Tape 2,
so that it's positioned at the beginning

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.120
of the key string, the thing we're
going to look for within the text y.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.730
At this point we move to state q3.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.490
In here we walk forward on both
tapes as long as we have a match.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.220
If we reach the blank
cell at the end of x,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.950
then we've found a matching
substring and we accept.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.755
If we reach a blank on the first tape,
then we reject,

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:04.250
since that means that x is longer than
the remaining portion of y, the search.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.150
And if we find a mismatch
between these two at any point,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.970
then we rewind one step on Tape 2,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.480
and then we rewind both tapes until
we get back to the beginning of x.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.780
And then we can repeat
this time will be checking

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.110
x against a substring of y
that's one further space down.
