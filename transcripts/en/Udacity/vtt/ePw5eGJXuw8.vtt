00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.910
So now that we've got our basic search

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.890
engine working, for the rest of the unit, we're

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.730
going to learn more about how we actually get

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.500
web pages on the internet. So far we've been

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.560
using the magic get_page function. And we provided

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.000
this function that takes as its input a URL,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.990
which is a resource locator on the web, and

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.360
it produces as output the contents of that page.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.595
I can show you the Python code that we use for

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:29.860
get_page. It won't really help very much in terms of understanding what's

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.130
going on, on the internet. But I don't want you to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.320
think there's anything hidden here. So the main thing that we're doing

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.860
in get_page is we're returning the result of calling URL open,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.090
passing in the URL. So that opens the web page that was

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.030
requested. And then reading that page. And that returns the output

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.790
of that page as a string. This is provided by the Python

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.270
library urllib, so we needed to import that library. And so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.900
that's what's going on. The rest of this is an exception

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.280
handler. So we call this a try block. That we are

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.190
going to try these things. They might not always work. And this is

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.160
where we use try. There might an error. Maybe the URL

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.820
is bad. Maybe we don't actually get a page back. Maybe the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.844
internet request times out, doesn't always work even if its in

00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:15.810
the URL. So that's why you put this inside a try block.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.860
And if something fails, execution will jump to the except

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.700
block. This is called the exception handler, and in this case

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.720
we just return an empty string. So that means if

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.070
we request a URL that can't be loaded instead of getting

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.650
an error it will just return an empty string, and

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.720
for the use in our web crawler this is a good

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.700
thing. If we didn't do this then the WebCrawler would

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.350
have to deal with a case where the page doesn't exist.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.840
In our case we just get an empty string, so there's no content on that page. So

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.980
looking at the actual code for get_page doesn't really

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.190
help us understand much about what's going on when

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.840
we request a webpage. All the actual work

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.360
is hidden in this Python library function. So in

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.120
order to understand more about what's going on, we

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.550
need to understand more about how the internet works.
