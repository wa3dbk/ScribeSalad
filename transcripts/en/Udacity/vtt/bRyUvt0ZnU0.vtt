00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.340
So let's think about how
we can compute homography.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.020
Let's start off,
my two images from my scene again.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.210
Again, this is
the Lord's Cricket Ground and

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.860
what I'm going to do is I'm going
to focus in on a specific region.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.700
Let's say this region here and
this region here.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.440
The reason I'm actually picking
these is because there's a nice

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.020
planar rectangle in that region and
we can actually use that as an example.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.120
Let's zoom these regions up.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.600
So we'll take this as one of our images
and the second one would be this one and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.430
let's look at them a little
bit more carefully.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.480
So here is my two regions,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.900
zoom and zoomed in the little
bit of the left panel.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.870
It's done to kind of find this one.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510
This is my equation.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.920
We know everything about it by now.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.250
What we're really interested in
computing is a new P-prime from

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.690
using the transformation
from the original piece.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.290
Let's find four points in this one and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.550
I did say there was a reason I found
this region because now I can actually

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.890
find four points at the corners of
this sign that was on the grass.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.180
I can find the same four points here.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.470
So, P-prime would be here.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.160
P is here, all right?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.220
So these are all xys and these would be,
of course, in my new coordinate system,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.180
x prime, y prime, using just this
equation, homogenous coordinates.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.425
So, again, all ps and all P-primes.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.830
So to compute the homography, H here,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.320
given pairs of corresponding
points in the two images,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.890
we need to set up a set of equations,
where the parameters of H are unknown.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.300
So, in essence, these are my two sets.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.800
I can most probably get the information
about where these locations are.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.720
What I actually don't know is what

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.530
H would be between those two images,
right?

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.700
So that's what we want to compute.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.200
We want to actually model
the transformation that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.890
goes from this to this because
if I know this transformation,

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.870
I can use this for a variety of things.
