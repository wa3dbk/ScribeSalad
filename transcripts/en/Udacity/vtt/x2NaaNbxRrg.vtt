00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.492
The complex conjugate of 1 plus 9 I is just 1 minus 9 I. Now let's find their

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:09.282
product. Having a bunch of 1's in here actually makes our multiplication pretty

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:13.818
easy. I like that. Now you just need to simplify this final term and combine

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:18.673
like terms. Notice already we can see these 2 terms, negative 9 I and positive 9

00:00:18.673 --> 00:00:22.964
I. Cancel one another out just like we had happen with our previous conjugate

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:27.465
pair multiplied together. I would like to pause at this step for a second where

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:31.697
we have 1 minus 81 i squared and note that this is a difference of 2 squares.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:36.125
This is actually what we would expect to get when we are multiplying things like

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.587
this together. Remember that we learned quite early on in the course that when

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:45.147
we multiply something in the form a plus b times a minus b. We get a squared

00:00:45.147 --> 00:00:50.619
minus b squared. This is exactly what's happening here. 1 is equal to 1 times 1

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.845
or a squared, and 81i squared is equal to 9i, the quantity squared. Now of

00:00:55.845 --> 00:01:01.805
course, we can simplify 81i squared because this is just a real number. Number.

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:08.434
I squared is just negative 1. And negative 81 times negative 1 is positive 81,

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.134
so our answer is 82.
