00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.210
The resulting code is much cleaner, easier to maintain, and simpler to

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.048
understand. We have our factory class that's been defined at top. The

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:10.038
spawnEntity function still takes a string that contains the typename and the

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:14.119
class definition. Which is looked up against the factory hash table that we

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.695
previously filled in with the class. This is all used together to create a new

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:22.815
instance of that entity object that's returned from spawnEntity.
