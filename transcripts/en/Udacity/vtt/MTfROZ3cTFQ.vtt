00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.310
So this is just, in picture form,
the address space 0 to 4 GB.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.017
This is the mode 3 GB we're talking
about, which is the user space,

00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:15.831
user core and data and
it can be accessed in user mode, or

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:19.347
the ring that corresponds
to user mode execution.

00:00:19.347 --> 00:00:22.646
And the high 1 GB has to be kernel mode,
and

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:26.877
that's where the kernel data,
and kernel code goes.

00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:31.775
So, this is just the split that we're
talking about here showing, drawing

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:36.915
the address space starting at 0 going
to the max, which is to the 31 minus 1.
