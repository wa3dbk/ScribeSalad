00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.150
All right. So let's put some of these rules into play

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.870
by actually doing some inference by hand. Ultimately, we're going to derive

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.520
some algorithms that can do this so you don't have to

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.330
think about it so hard. But understanding those algorithms, it's helpful to

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.430
have gone through an exercise where you actually use these ideas.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.926
So here's a setup. Let's imagine that we've got two boxes. Onee

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:21.146
has 4 balls in it and one has 5 balls in it.

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:25.290
And we're going to choose one of those boxes uniformly at random.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.370
Either the box that we choose is equal to box 1,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.190
or the box that we choose is equal to box 2.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.246
And after that, we're going to draw at random, uniformly at

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:38.224
random, from what's inside the box, one of the balls, and

00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:41.460
let's say it turns out to be green. All right. So

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.150
the draw that we make, we have a green ball. We

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.010
reach into that same box a second time, and the question

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.410
is, what's the probability that that second ball will be blue,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.950
given that the first one we drew was green? So

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.160
let's, to make, maybe to help point out how this

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.430
is connected with Bayes net inference, Charles, why don't you

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.360
help me draw the Bayes net that corresponds to this problem.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.470
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, if I think about it as

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.700
a process, which now means I'm, I'm thinking about this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.940
as things causing the other, the first thing that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.840
you did in the process is you picked the box.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.480
&gt;&gt; Good. All right. So let's say, so the first variable in

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.170
the net is going to be the box variable.,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.826
&gt;&gt; Right, and then once I had the box variable

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:22.110
over there, I can then pick, the second thing in

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.120
the process is I pick a ball. So, in this

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.119
case you're calling it 1. So I make the first pick.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.760
&gt;&gt; And is it, do we need an arrow there?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because the, you pick the box and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.110
then that let's you pick which ball that you have.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.410
So, which ball you pick, the color of the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.160
ball you pick, depends upon the box so to speak.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.510
&gt;&gt; Good. And so, the probabilities here are

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.342
going to be, it's going to look like this.

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:45.500
All right. So the second variable here is what, what

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.790
color ball you get when you do the first draw

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.130
from the box. Ad we can represent this as a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.140
conditional probability table. So for box 1, it's three quarters

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.659
green, one quarter yellow or orange, zero for blue. And

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.771
for box 2, it's two fifths, zero, and three fifths.

00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:03.330
And so that captures what happens on the first draw.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.270
&gt;&gt; So for the second draw,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.180
well, clearly, that sort of depends upon what you drew

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.008
the first time. Because you said we were drawing without

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:16.000
replacement. So it definitely depends upon what you, what you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.868
drew the first time. But also, it still depends upon

00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:22.365
the box. Okay, so now we've got tables for a

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:24.560
box, we've got tables for ball 1, and we need

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.570
to know what ball 2 is going to be. Well,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.270
the value that ball 2 takes definitely depends upon whatever

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.980
value ball 1 takes.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.765
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:37.330
&gt;&gt; But it also depends upon which box you're

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.420
in. So you need an arrow from there as well.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.140
And what would be really nice is if we

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.280
were in the storm, lightening and thunder case where, if

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.610
I knew that it was, what ball 1 was,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.670
I would know what ball 2 was, but that's not

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.010
true. Because in a case, for example, when ball

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.430
1 is green, it doesn't tell me what ball 2

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.380
is unless I also know which box I'm in. So,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.220
we have to draw the arrow from box to ball 2.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.916
&gt;&gt; Indeed. Right. And so there's a lot

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.302
of, a lot of probabilities that we have

00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:09.529
to write down. But let's, let's just write down a piece of that table. Let's say

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:14.745
that the value of ball 2 depends on which box. And it depends on what

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:19.844
ball 1 is. But let's just look at the piece of that table where ball 1 is green.

00:03:19.844 --> 00:03:20.192
&gt;&gt; hm.

00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:21.532
&gt;&gt; because that's what we're

00:03:21.532 --> 00:03:25.095
ultimately going to need here. So now ball 2, in

00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:27.535
the case where we were drawing from box 1, that

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:31.525
probably that's green. In the case were the first ball

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:35.355
had been green, it leaves just 2 out of 3, right.

00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:35.855
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:41.109
&gt;&gt; And 1 out of 3 yellow and no blue. But on the other hand, had we drawn

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.617
from box 2 first, and again, we had gotten green, now it's green one fourth,

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:49.468
zero yellow, and blue three quarters.

00:03:49.468 --> 00:03:50.110
&gt;&gt; RIght.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.930
&gt;&gt; And there's yeah, we need this same

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.780
thing where the other case, where ball 1 is

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.529
yellow and ball 1 is blue. But we are

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.234
not going to need those numbers for this problem.

00:03:59.234 --> 00:03:59.717
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:59.717 --> 00:04:01.828
&gt;&gt; All right. So now that we have written it as

00:04:01.828 --> 00:04:04.384
a Bayes net, is that, is that helpful at all? So what

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:07.740
we're, we haven't asked the question yet. So maybe it's time

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.490
to ask the question and then we could work on the answer.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.690
&gt;&gt; All right. The question

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.900
is, what's the probability that the second draw is

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.510
blue, given that the first draw had been green? Go.
