00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.080
So we've talked about uh,classification and regression and gave a

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.240
couple of examples of each. So now I want you to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.370
take a moment to make certain that you understand the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.530
difference because it's a crucial difference for supervised learning. Here's a

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.130
very short little quiz. You have three questions here and

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.440
we divided the world up into some input to some learning

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.790
algorithm, whatever that learning algorithm is. The output that we're

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.400
expecting and then a box for you to tell us whether

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.860
its classification or regression. So, the first question, the input is

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.110
credit history, whatever that means, the number of loans that you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.220
have, how much money you make, how many times you've defaulted,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.070
how many times you've been late, the sort of things that make

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.660
up credit history, and the output of the learning algorithm is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.550
rather you should lend money or not. So you're a bank,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.310
and you're trying to determine whether given a credit history, I

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.200
should lend this person money, that's question one. Is that classification, or

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.390
is that regression? Question two you take as input

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.110
a picture like the examples that we've given before.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.710
And the output of your learning system is going

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.160
to be whether this person is of high school age,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.630
college age, or grad student age. The third question is very similar.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.660
The input is again a picture. And the output is, I guess, of the actual

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.300
age of the person, 17, 24, 23 and a half, whatever.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.240
So take a moment and try to decide

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.330
whether these are classification tasks or regression tasks.
