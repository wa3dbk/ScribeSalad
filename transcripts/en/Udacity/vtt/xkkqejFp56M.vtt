Thank you for that Greg. Now you've most likely heard of another type of memory

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:08.127
loss. Which is a result of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:12.620
devastating disease. Again for both people with Alzheimer's and their loved

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.900
ones. Alzheimer's can effect people over the age of 60. It's a very rare to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.870
have an early onset Alzheimer's disease. And Alzheimer's disease results in

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.860
progressive memory loss, and eventually complete memory loss.
