00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.969
You may think it's pretty inefficient that we have to

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.760
type a URL into the browser every time we want to grab

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.450
some data from last.fm's API. There has to be a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.980
more efficient way to do this and you're right. We can

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.740
write a simple Python program that uses the JSON and

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.740
request libraries to do exactly what we did manually a few

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.160
moments ago. If we run this program right here, let's think

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.880
of what it returns. Look, the data that this Python program

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.200
returned is exactly the same based on data that

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.742
you saw in the browser a second ago. This

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:34.060
program was less than 10 lines. First we specify

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.706
a URL, then we simply say request that get,

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:42.980
that URL and call.text, in order to get the

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.330
text. We assign that value to data. We print

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.830
type of data which we saw was Unicode, and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.190
we print data itself, which was the JSON object.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.620
But if we go back and look at the JSON

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.530
object itself, we see that it's in this funky string format

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.390
that makes it very hard for us to parse out

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.180
the interesting information. We could write a Regex to parse out

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.670
what we want, but that can get pretty painful really

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.660
quickly. The JSON library will make interacting with JSON data as

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.090
easy as 1, 2, 3. Let me show you how.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.370
We've modified our script ever so slightly. After initially assigning data,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.374
we reassign it. We say data equals json.loads

00:01:20.374 --> 00:01:25.920
data. What json.loads does is it interprets a string

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.960
and assumes that it's a JSON object. By doing

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.380
so, we convert the JSON data into a Python

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.310
dictionary. We'll see that when we print type

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.760
data. Once we convert the data into a nicely

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.580
structured dictionary, we can get the interesting bits out

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.210
as if we're simply accessing a dictionary. For example,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.670
typing data artist. Let's see what this script

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.260
produces now. As we can see, what we return

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.180
here is that the type of the object is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.520
a dictionary and then we have a Python dictionary.
