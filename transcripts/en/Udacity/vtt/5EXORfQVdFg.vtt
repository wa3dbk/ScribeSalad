00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.814
All that we are, who we are, what we think and what we feel is due to our brain

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:08.176
chemistry. We're like walking chemical factories producing the chemicals that

00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:13.144
we need to function daily. However, sometimes these chemicals can change and

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:16.798
this change can affect our mood, our ability to learn and remember, and even

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:22.144
our behavior. For example, our brains produce and use dopamine which is a

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:25.952
neurotransmitter responsible for a reward behavior such as having sex or eating

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:31.406
a good meal. Now, some drugs can increase the amount of a neurotransmitter

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:35.724
that's available. For example, methamphetamines increase the amount of dopamine

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:39.499
that's available. This can result in a person feeling really great when they're

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:43.548
under the influence. The feeling of euphoria. However, there are negative

00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:48.812
effects associated with excessive dopamine levels. For example, stimuli-induced

00:00:48.812 --> 00:00:52.570
psychosis. In this part of the lesson, we're going to talk about three main

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.339
classes of drugs. Stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens. I'm going to send

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.755
you over to Susan to get started on our discussion of stimulants.
