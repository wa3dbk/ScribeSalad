00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.000
So, we decided to call the price per wiper
set w. That means that if Grant sells one

00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:13.925
set of wipers, he'll earn w dollars. If he
sells two sets, he'll earn w+w dollars,

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:20.599
which is 2w dollars. If he sells three
sets, he'll earn w+w+w, or 3w, and so on

00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:26.555
and so forth. Since you know that he is
going to sell 36 wiper sets, that means

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:32.311
he's going to make 36w dollars off of the
wipers alone. So, 36w is the correct

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:32.859
answer.
