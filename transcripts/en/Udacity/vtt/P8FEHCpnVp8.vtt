00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.370
This quiz will see if you understand execution time

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.770
well enough to make some predictions. So, here's the

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.320
code we had before that times the execution of

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.180
evaluating a Python expression that we pass in as

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.740
code. And we've defined spin loop as a while

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.390
loop that goes through a loop that just adds

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.660
one the number of times of the variable passed

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.090
in. So let's try that in the Python interpreter.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.230
We're going to time an execution where

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.560
what we're evaluating is calling spin loop, passing

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.584
in some numbers. So we'll try 1,000 first.

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:39.390
And what time execution does is return two

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.620
values. The result and the run time. We only want the second one, so we'll index

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.654
to get the second value out of the return result, and see that result. So that's

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:57.088
what we get, so it took 0.0001 seconds to do spin loop a thousand. If I increase

00:00:57.088 --> 00:01:04.369
this to 10,000, I see that it takes 0.0006. let's try 100,000,

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.894
adding one more zero and I see now it takes 0.005. I'm going to write this a

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:15.770
little differently, so we can see it more easily. So now, instead of writing

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.070
out a 100,000, I'll do ten star, star, five, which is the same value as writing

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.810
out a one followed by five zeros. And for good measure, we'll do ten star, star,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.350
six, which is a million times through the loop, and we see that, that takes 0.05

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.180
seconds. So here's the examples of timing loops.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.420
For your quiz, your goal is to estimate

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.940
the expected execution time for a value running spin loop where the input of the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.550
loop is ten star star nine, that's one

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.480
billion. And you should give your answer in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.110
the number of seconds. Of course it's not

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.980
possible to get the exact answer, but you

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.920
should be able to get a guess within about 20% of our answer to be correct.
