00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.840
So here's a t-table that applies to statistical

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.290
estimates with fewer than 30 samples. And the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.590
way to read through this on the left you see the degrees of freedom which is the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.910
number of samples minus 1. So if you have 10 samples it would be 9, if there are

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.950
15 samples it would be 14. On the top, you'll see 1 minus the confidence level.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.898
So if you want 95% confidence, you go to 0.05. If you

00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:34.722
want 98% confidence, you go to 0.02. Now there's a slight

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:39.580
distinction here. There's a 1-tail and a 2-tails. So far, we've

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.780
talked about 2-tails in which, we always cut off tails left

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.990
and right of our confidence interval. There are occasions, which we'll

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.130
talk about later, where we should just cut off one side.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.460
And those often occur in the context of testing

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.690
hypotheses. Now for the time being, please just look

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.640
at the 2-tails number over here. And ignore all

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.510
those 1-tail numbers in this table. Okay? So just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.720
to make sure you know how to read this

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.150
table. Suppose we have n=8 samples and we look

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.390
for a 90% confidence interval. What number would you

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.610
find in this table to be the magic number?
