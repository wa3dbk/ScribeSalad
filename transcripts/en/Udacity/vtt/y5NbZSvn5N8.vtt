Now, recall that the browser builds a Tree-Like Structure of the page.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.730
And when I say, tree, I don't literally mean this type of tree.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.250
I just mean a branching structure.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.820
Sideways triangles are an HTML element.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.210
Each has an opening tag and a closing tag.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.260
Now this can simply be text, like you see here.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.347
Or it can be another element, like this span or this a.

00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:39.066
So that we can get a better visual understanding,

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.278
let's draw this structure ourselves.

00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:44.549
First, we have this div element.

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:51.789
Then inside of the div, we have an h2 and a p element.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.453
Then inside of this h2, we have the span element and

00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:59.427
inside span, we have some text.

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:01.850
Now if we go back to the p element.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.570
Inside, we have text and two a elements.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.990
And then inside of each of the a elements, we have text.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.270
And now it's time for you to explore the structure of a page on your own.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.160
Please follow the link we have provided in the instructor note section below.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.430
And open Google's Developer Tools.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.880
Then create your own Tree-Like Structure to describe the page.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.370
Make sure to fill in the boxes in the same order that they appear in the tree.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.310
And if the element contains text, write the word text in the box
