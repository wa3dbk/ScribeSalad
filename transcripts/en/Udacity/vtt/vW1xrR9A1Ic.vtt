There are all sorts of different ways to view the world. Here are three, a

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.739
fish-eye lens, a perspective view and an orthographic view. These are all

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:10.978
different types of projections. A projection maps locations in the world to

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:14.637
locations on the screen. A fish-eye projection is possible to simulate in

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:17.910
computer graphics. Hey, just about anything can be simulated in computer

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.324
graphics, but it's rarely used in practice. These other two projections are

00:00:21.324 --> 00:00:24.574
more popular for a number of reasons. First they act similarly to a how a

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:28.655
camera captures a picture. So we're used to them. Straight lines stay straight

00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:32.246
unlike a fisheye lense. All in all the math is simpler. A perspective view

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:36.469
we'll usually associate with seeing the world. Distant objects get smaller. An

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.034
orthographic view is much more common in design software. In an orthographic

00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:43.512
view objects do not get smaller as they get more distant. Parallel lines in the

00:00:43.512 --> 00:00:46.328
real world stay parallel in this kind of view as opposed to perspective where

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:47.739
they do not.
