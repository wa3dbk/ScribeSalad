00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.936
This next quiz is a bit tricky. It turns out that chez_bananas is actually a

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:08.584
very yummy restaurant, I highly recommend it, especially the carrots. Now,

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:13.461
without changing restaurant, your goal is to add code to get this behavior. So,

00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.304
we're going to create a new at restaurant object, we're going to have some code

00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:21.208
and then we're going to get the result of evaluating chez<u>bananas.is</u>yummy

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:26.048
produces True. This is a little tricky, but if you get it, you'll understand a

00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:28.663
lot about what's going on with methods.
