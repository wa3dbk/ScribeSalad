00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.460
We've looked at creating modules and
controllers, and

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.630
applying them to templates using Angular
specific attributes, called directives.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.460
But how does Angular actually make
the connection between the data

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.970
and the template?

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.780
When data changes in the website.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.750
How does it update in the controller?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.140
It all depends on Angular scope.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.650
Angular scope is an object that
refers to an applications data.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.470
It's the bridge between the template and
the controller.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.450
And is the vehicle for
Angular's two-way data binding.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.610
Data gets set initially
in the controller,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.710
then when the engine controller
directive is added to the template.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.560
The template now has a context for
its expressions.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.190
When the expressions change in
the template, the controller is updated.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.560
Let's see all this in action.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.455
See how Angular added
an ng-scope class to this div?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.880
When Angular compiled this template,
it solved this directive.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.710
And created a scope object that's
associated with this element.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.840
So when it came to
the expressions in the template,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.180
it could resolve them from the scope.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.060
Checking the scope for
the divs shows us a lot of information.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.230
The scope has an ID.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.480
It also has a parent scope.

00:01:03.308 --> 00:01:06.350
Inside our parent scope is our
menu property with the data from

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.238
the controller.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.680
In the list of properties on
the scope object is $$watchers.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.580
Watchers.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.330
This is a list of things that angular
is watching for, for changes.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.008
There is one watcher for
each expression.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.260
Here's the one to watch the menu
image property for changes.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.330
If Angular sees a change
in one of the watchers,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.089
then it will update the property in
either the controller or the template.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.330
At first, it's hard to understand
how two-way data binding works

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.840
between templates and
controllers in Angular.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.140
Scope is the key that
binds them together and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.110
performs updates when
either side changes.
