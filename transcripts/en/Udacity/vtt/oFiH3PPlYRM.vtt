00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I'd like to do now is look into this issue in a little bit more detail.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If we think about a piece of software as a mathematical object--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and of course that's very natural for something like a square root function,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but we can do this for any piece of software--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
if we think of a piece of software as a mathematical object,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
what we'll find is the software has a domain of values.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The domain of values is just a set of possible values 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that constitutes the set of inputs that the software is designed to handle.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Correspondingly, every piece of software also has a range.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is the set of possible outputs for the software.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And so let's look at what the domain and range are for the square root function.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Earlier we said that we probably would like to return the positive answer for a square root,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and we also said that we were probably not going to be able to compute 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the square root of a negative number.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We can account for both of those facts in the square root's domain and range

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
by making it a function from non-negative real-valued numbers

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to non-negative real-valued numbers.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Alternatively, if we're implementing some sort of mathematical software,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we might want to define square root for all real-valued numbers,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in which case the domain is the full set of real numbers,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then the range is the set of complex numbers.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Actual computer code is not going to be able to deal with a full set of real numbers.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Most real-valued numbers are not representable on a computer at all.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So instead of dealing with the reals, we're going to worry about floating-point numbers.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So for example, we might want to make square root 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
a function from non-negative floating-point numbers 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to the set of non-negative floating-point numbers.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But this isn't really very convenient.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What should we do if somebody calls square root with a negative number?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What languages like Python often do is declare square root 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
over the full range of floating-point numbers

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and give outputs that are the positive ranged floating-point numbers

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
unioned with a different behavior, which is to throw an exception.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And so this bottom domain and range for floating point

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is the situation we actually get in many real programming languages.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So now given the specification, let's get back to software testing and ask the question,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
should we test this square root function with negative inputs?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now let's bring the discussion back to testing and take a little quiz.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The question is, given this specification here 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
where square root maps the full set of floating-point numbers

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
onto either a floating-point number or a math exception,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
should we test this code with negative inputs?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And the answers are either yes, we should test it with negative inputs,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
or no, we should not. So take a minute now to mark down your answer.
