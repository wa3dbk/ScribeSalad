00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.370
The cache first, then network strategy
is ideal for our weather app.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.290
It gets the weather forecast on
screen as quickly as possible.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.430
Then, it updates the forecast
once the network

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.880
has returned with the latest data.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.620
Using this strategy, we expect
the network response to be the source of

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.380
truth, always providing us
with the most up-to-date data.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.210
To implement this strategy,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.090
we need to kick off two
parallel asynchronous requests.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.800
One to the cache, so we can get some
data on screen as quickly as possible,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.610
even though it might be stale.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.431
The second request is made over
the network to get the latest data.

00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:46.289
Under normal circumstances,
the cache data will be returned almost

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.290
immediately, providing the app with
some recent data that it can use.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.140
Then, when the network request returns,
the app should store the response in

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.810
the cache and update the screen with
the latest data it just received.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.960
This also means that even on Wi-Fi
networks or when there's no network

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.160
connection at all,
the user still sees data from the cache.
