Hi, welcome back to the show. Let's take a look at the solution here. So, our

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.430
loadAsset function should first check the gCachedAssets dictionary for the file

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.566
name that was provided if the file is not present in the cache, then the result

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:15.250
of this access will return no. If this happens we know that the image has been

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.096
loaded, and we need to actually issue a load call. From here we can actually

00:00:19.096 --> 00:00:22.599
create our image do our on load, and set our source. Once is all done we

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.133
actually set the image object as the value to the key of asset name inside of

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.580
the cache. This allows us later, once again, to go through, query for a name

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.765
and get an object, which you can see down here. If the object has already been

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:37.517
loaded, then when we query for it, we'll get a something back, which allows us

00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:41.613
to pass that image object to the callback function that was given to us.
