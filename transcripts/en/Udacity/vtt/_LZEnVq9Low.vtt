00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.523
At first the experiment was uneventful, the teacher delivered the smaller

00:00:04.523 --> 00:00:09.846
shocks in the shock generator whenever the learner made an error. However, as

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:13.323
the shocks increased in intensity, many of the teachers became very

00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:18.329
uncomfortable and unsure about continuing. When the teachers expressed to

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.359
Milgram that they didn't want to continue, Milgram would tell the teacher that

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.800
the experiment must continue. You must continue with the experiment. So, every

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.100
time the teacher tried to ask Milgram to stop, he told them that they were

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.102
unable to do so and they needed to continue delivering the shocks. While the

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:41.996
teacher was administering the shocks, he heard some preprogrammed responses

00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:47.898
from the learner. For example, at 90 volts, the learner would yell ugh. And its

00:00:47.898 --> 00:00:52.716
at these times when the teacher became uncomfortable and would tell Milgram, I

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:57.845
want to stop. And recall, Milgram would say, you must continue, the experiment

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:03.121
must go on. At 150 volts, The teacher would hear the learner yell "get me out

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:09.014
of here! My heart's starting to bother me. I refused to go on. Let me out!".

00:01:09.014 --> 00:01:13.046
Here again, the teacher will become uncomfortable and tell Milgram that he

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:17.390
wanted to stop. In each instance, Milgram reminded the person that he had to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.100
continue with the experiment and that he could not leave. Finally, when the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.626
volts went past 330, the teacher would hear no response from the learner at

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:32.710
all. And this implied that the leaner was either unconcious, or worse. Remember

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.820
when Milgram asked those experts how many people would go up to 450 volts?

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.440
Well, they were very wrong. In fact, in his results he found that 65% of the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.235
participants went all the way to 450 volts. Also, there were no differences in

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.590
the sexes, meaning men and women were equally likely to go all the way up to

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.783
450 volts. Interestingly, adding the yelling of the learner at 150 volts, where

00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:05.946
he yelled, 'Let me out of here. I don't want to continue,' did decrease

00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:11.510
obedience from 100% to down to 83%. It's important to point out that the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.982
participants were debriefed, and told after the study, what the study was

00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:19.595
actually about. And they were reunited, the teacher and the learner and the

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:23.853
teacher could see that the learner was actually never harmed. Milgram conducted

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:28.736
a series of studies in this area and changed some of the variables. For

00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:32.598
example, he changed the attire of the researcher. It turns out that people were

00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:35.978
more likely to obey when the researcher was wearing a white lab coat, than when

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:40.736
the researcher was more casually dressed, like here. In one experiment, he

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:44.116
changed the proximity of the teacher and the learner, and removed the barrier

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:49.727
so they could see each other. In these situations, the teacher was much less

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:54.866
likely to go all the way to 450 volts. These are called systematic replications

00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:59.432
of the original research study. So, it turns out that there are many variables

00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:03.980
that influenced obedience to authority. Now, let's go to Greg to talk a little

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.545
bit more in-depth about the ethics of this Milgram experiment.
