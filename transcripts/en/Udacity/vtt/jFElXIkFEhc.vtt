00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.860
So now let's go back to the things that we need

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.300
to operate a network. So we need a way to encode

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.460
and interpret messages. So we saw that we can encode any

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.600
message that we want in bits. And then we can encode the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.270
bits on the wire. How that encoding actually works is pretty

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.490
complicated, it's not something that we're going to talk about in this class,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.520
but there are lots of different ways to do it. But

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.640
we're figuring out ways for each zero and one to encode that

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.610
as something that we send along a wire, or it could be

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.760
wireless. What we haven't talked about, which we're, we are going to talk

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.760
about soon, is what these high level messages are. Right? We need

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.190
ways to send messages that can be interpreted and understood at the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.710
other side. And so, what we'll talk about next is how that

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.760
works on the internet. As far as the way to route messages.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.500
For the internet, all of the routers along that path. Well, a

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.790
message comes in. It has a desination. The routers have to figure

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.730
out the next destination to go to. And that's also quite a

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.250
challenging problem. It's something we're not

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.670
going to get into more detail in this

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.990
class. But you can imagine different ways you might do this. A router

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.239
might have a table that says, well, if you're in California and you

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.720
want to send a message to Boston, you should first send it to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.060
Nevada, because that's going in the right direction. That's not quite the way

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.310
things work, because we saw that there was actually just one message. That

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.860
really, what you want to do is send it to San Jose, we've got

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.920
a big strong pipe that goes all the way to Boston.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.620
Finally you need ways to decide who gets resources. And on

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.710
our Greek network we assume that the general could decide. The

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100
internet is much more of a wild west in that in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.030
the internet there aren't any real rules for who gets resources.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.680
Everywhere along the network gets to decide on it's own how

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.600
to do that. And what we really get on the Internet

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.190
is just what we call best effort service. If your message

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.800
needs to go over the same link as some other message, the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.560
router can only send one message at a time. It's up to the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.805
router to decide what to do. There are different policies that different routers

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:53.730
follow. There's no general rule that is enforced on the whole internet. And

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.580
this means that sometimes your packet might just get dropped. There's no

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.280
guarantee, when you send a message on the internet, that it actually gets

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.200
to where you want it to. So we're not going to talk more about

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.280
these two in this class. I'll encourage you to take a future networking

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.949
class that will get into those details. We are going to talk

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.750
a little bit about how the messages work for the web.
