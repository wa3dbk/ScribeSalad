00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.578
Here are the correct answers. Great work if you got those correct. For the

00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:08.290
first one we simply multiply the radicants together to get the square root of

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.957
25. We know the square root of 25 equals 5. For the second one we really have 5

00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:19.475
times 5, since the square root of 25 equals 5. We know 5 times 5 equals 25, our

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:24.544
final answer. Another way to do this problem would be to multiply these two

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:30.450
radicants together to get 625. So really we're taking the square root of 625 or

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.676
25 squared. Notice that whenever you multiply a radical by itself, you just get

00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:41.227
whatever was underneath it in the first place, just 25. Now this is only true

00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:46.432
for square roots, it won't be true for high order roots. To start multiplying

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:50.440
the third one, we want to multiply the numbers on the outside together first.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.284
So we'll have 5 times 5 on the outside and then the square root of 25 here. We

00:00:55.284 --> 00:01:01.146
know 5 times 5 equals 25 and we know the square root of 25 equals 5. We

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:05.865
multiply one last time to get 125. This is the simplification for the fourth

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.836
one, and we really just want to break down the 50 into a perfect square. We

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:14.386
take the square root of 25, which equals 5, and then multiply these two numbers

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:21.300
together to get 25 root 2. And finally for our last one, 2 times 12 equals 24.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.574
And then we multiply the cube roots together to get the cube root of 24, that's

00:01:25.574 --> 00:01:30.780
this 12 times 2. We split up 24 into 8 times 3 so that we can take the cube

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.260
root of 8, which equals 2. We multiply one last time to get 48 times the cube

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.884
root of 3. Nice effort on these problems.
