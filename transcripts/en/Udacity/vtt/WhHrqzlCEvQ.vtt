00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
The question, of course, is if this table here actually suggests that

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.560
randomized algorithms for 3-SAT will always be faster than deterministic algorithms.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.150
And I would argue no here, simply for the reason that such a statement

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.060
would in some way have to be proven or at least argued for

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.020
with more than just empirical data, but I believe we can also think of some other reasons

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.180
why randomized algorithms currently have better upper bounds than deterministic ones.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.650
So my question for you to think about is, what could be the reasons

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.190
that the randomized 3-SAT algorithms that we've just seen in the table

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.470
have generally better bounds than the deterministic ones?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.890
Could it be because randomization is more powerful somehow than determinism?

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.690
Could the reason be that no one has yet had the right idea

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.260
simply how to design a better deterministic algorithm?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.920
Or could it be that analyzing deterministic algorithms is in a way

00:00:51.920 --> 99:59:59.000
more complex than analyzing randomized algorithms?
