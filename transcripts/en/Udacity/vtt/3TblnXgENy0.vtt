00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.750
So here was our problem. Data.largest returns a measurable. That's all it can

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.538
return, because the data class knows nothing about countries. We need a

00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:13.680
country, and the answer is simply to cast. The cast is legitimate, the largest

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.340
country had to be one of the countries that was put in, and its proof safe to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.937
convert back from a measurable to the country. let's think once more what

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:27.556
advantage we get from the measurable interface. When you look at the BlueJ,

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:31.582
display of classes and the interfaces, you can clearly see that country and car

00:00:31.582 --> 00:00:37.153
both implement the measurable interface. You can see that the data class uses

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:42.282
the measurable interface, that's the dotted line here. And what's important is

00:00:42.282 --> 00:00:46.440
that the data class knows absolutely nothing about country's cars or any other

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.214
classes. It's decoupled from those classes, and that's what makes it, so

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:56.246
generic. Now, Sarah will introduce you to an interface that's much more

00:00:56.246 --> 00:00:58.620
commonly used, a comparable interface.
