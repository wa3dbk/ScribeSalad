00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.240
Android Wear devices are paired
up with a companion phone but

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.590
are not allowed to connect
to the Internet directly.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.848
This is done for many reasons.

00:00:06.848 --> 00:00:08.150
Including the following.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.660
Saving battery power.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.210
The phone is responsible for
dealing with internet and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.980
sending only the important
information to the wearable.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.490
Dealing with sporadic connections.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.870
The wearable may not always
be in range of the phone.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.330
And dealing with
different network types,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.270
the wearable may connect with
many different ways to the phone.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.780
So we definitely need
an abstraction layer here and

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.060
the Android Wear
framework provides this.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.070
There are two main mechanisms used
to communicate between a phone and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.580
an Android Wear device,
data items and messages.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.980
Let's talk firstly about data items.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.081
These provide storage
of key value pairs,

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.600
as well as automatic
synchronization of the data.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.480
So you can create a data item on one
device, fill in the key value pairs, and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.965
then give it to the data API.

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:50.284
Once you've done this, it synchronized
through whatever means possible to all

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:51.830
the other devices paired up.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.080
The other devices can then register
a listener that'll have a method code

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.590
when a change arrives in the data item.
