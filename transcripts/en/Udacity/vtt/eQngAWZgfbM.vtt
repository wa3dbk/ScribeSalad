00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.610
Earlier we talked about the potential
applications of analytics

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.808
to the determination
of optimal treatment.

00:00:06.808 --> 00:00:11.700
That often now means the best
results at the lowest costs.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.530
These are of course not precisely
defined terms and there is serious

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.860
debate about issues such as the value of
spending substantial sums on treatments

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.050
that only prolong the life of terminal
patients by small increments in time.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.040
The research shown here
illustrates the potential to help

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.530
with less controversial
clinical contexts.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.830
A partially observable Markov decision
process, a variation that introduces

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.295
memory, was developed and compared
to the actual treatment of nearly

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:49.480
6,000 depressed patients, abstracted
from their electronic records.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.030
I leave it to you to read this section
in the text for the details, but

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.860
as shown here, under certain assumptions
the model delivered improvements

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.910
that were better than or
almost as good as real physicians, but

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.140
at a better cost per
unit of improvement.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.215
As we seek to re-engineer the health
care system, technologies like this may

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:14.015
become a routine part of
clinical decision support.

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:17.045
Some would even speculate that,

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:21.915
at least in certain circumstances,
they may replace physicians.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.375
But I leave it to you to consider that.
