00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.317
Here's what I did. I checked how many passengers I already have, now I want to

00:00:04.317 --> 00:00:09.606
add a new person. And of course, there's the driver. So if passengers size plus

00:00:09.606 --> 00:00:13.913
2, one for the new person, one for the driver, is less equal the number of

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:19.288
seats, then I'm good. I also have to check the destination. So, and if the

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:22.884
destination is below the destination of this car, in that case I can add the

00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:27.880
passenger and return true. Otherwise I won't add and return false.
