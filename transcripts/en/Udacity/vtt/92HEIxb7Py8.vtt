00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.820
The answer is, it's the system class. You've been using system.out a lot in

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.282
this course, probably much more often than Math.PI. But anyway, it is a

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:13.914
variable that doesn't belong to any object of this system class. It just

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:18.546
belongs to the system class itself. Now, Sarah is going to show you another

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.452
static variable that she would add to the person class, that gives another

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:26.761
example where static variables can be useful.
