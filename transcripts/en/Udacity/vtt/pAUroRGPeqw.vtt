00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.757
The heart of a shader is the actual shader program it runs. This program is

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:07.812
passed to the GPU as a string of characters. I'll repeat that, since it's a bit

00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:11.204
unusual. Instead of sending compiled code or binary data, or some other

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:14.220
processed information to the driver, you actually send it a string of

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.072
characters. WebGL shaders are written in GLSLES, the OpenGL Shading Language

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:26.790
for Embedded Systems. No one calls it GLSLES. Everyone simply says GLSL. If you

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.102
use DirectX, you'd use HLSL -- thy are High Level Shading Language. In either

00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:34.738
case, the character string is what gets sent to the graphics driver. The

00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:37.820
graphics driver compiles these into assembly instructions that are sent to the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.454
GPU. Here's how to create a shader string in Javascript. The first line is how

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:45.550
Javascript says it's going to define an array. What we're doing here is

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.361
defining a string for each line of our program. That's one way to get shader

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:53.185
programs into 3GS, but it's usually not the most convenient. There are all

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.020
these quote marks and commas, which are visually confusing and a pain to add

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.827
and maintain. That said, one advantage of this approach is that you can glue

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:04.075
together strings on the fly to make shaders. This is in fact exactly what 3GS

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:07.613
does. When you ask for three lights on a shiny material, it creates a custom

00:01:07.613 --> 00:01:12.144
shader for exactly those elements. If you have a specific fixed shader in mind,

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:16.060
an easier way is to make your program a separate text resource. I won't work

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.312
through the mechanics here. This isn't really a web programming class. But see

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:23.472
the code in this course's get hub repository for how we do it. Basically, you

00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:26.288
create a separate text file or script element that has your program's text in

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:27.219
it.
