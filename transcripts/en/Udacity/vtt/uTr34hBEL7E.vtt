00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.631
It's time to launch the rest of your
cluster from the Ambari node image.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.570
Launch six instances,
these should also m3.large instances and

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.300
given 30 gigabytes of storage each.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.030
Call it something like Ambari node, and

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.490
otherwise, set all
the options like before.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.350
Once the instances are launched, you'll
want to configure the security rules.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.540
You'll need the internal host names,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.190
the private DNS of each of your
instances, so copy these into a file.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.150
Mine looks like this.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.644
Those names also show the IP addresses
of each instance, these numbers here.

00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:42.722
This one is 172.31.15.28.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:46.818
You need allow for communication between
the nodes by opening all the ports on

00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:48.907
the subnet containing the instances.

00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:50.270
Look at the IP addresses.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.080
Note the network number, the first
set of numbers in the IP address.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.760
Here it's 172, but for
you it might be different.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.280
Check out the security group for
the nodes, then edit the inbound rules.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.970
Create a new custom TCP rule.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.420
Set the Port to a range from 0 to 65535.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.744
And the Source to x.0.0.0/8,
where x is your network number.

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:17.290
In my case it's 172, but again,
for you it's probably different.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.450
This allows the nodes to connect to
other hosts on the subnet with IP

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.730
addresses starting with x.172.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.620
Be sure this rule is added to
the Ambari server as well.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.036
If you don't know about subnets and
want to learn more,

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:30.565
check out our networking course.

00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:31.360
I'll give you the link.
