00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.510
1 decision that has to be made early on in the interpretation of a server

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.760
is whether or not to use parallel computing.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.540
There are a range of ways for doing so

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.190
and all of these can be combined with each other.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.310
We have vector units on the CPU,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.350
which are units that can operate on vectors;

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.620
apply the same operation to say, 4 different values, at the same time.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.860
Multicore CPUs allow us to do several very complex things at the same time.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.479
The same is true for multiprocessor systems.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:38.270
GPUs, graphics chips, are optimized for working with huge arrays of pixels,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.270
but they can work with everything else as well.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.990
Which means, of course, they are also good at working with matrices.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.680
It's rather difficult to speed up servers for ordinary differential equations.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.140
The server does 1 step at a time,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.270
and every following step depends on the step before.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.770
How could you do some of these in parallel?

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.770
That does not seem to work well.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.700
Speeding up a differential equation server for ordinary differential equations

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.599
with the help of parallel computing may work,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.840
for instance in a situation where you have lots of isolated entities

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.260
which rarely influence each other, such as the planets orbiting the sun.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.900
As you have seen in unit 6, it's of vital importance

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.960
to speed up servers for partial differential equations.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.930
And in this case, parallel computing really comes to help.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.890
1 option for this is to use spatial subdivision.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.200
Each processor of a multicore system can handle its own spatial domain.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.730
Treating the borders between the different domains right requires communication.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.340
This can become an expensive overhead.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.380
We'll look into that in the next quiz.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.710
When we apply finite elements or work with implicit servers

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.980
for partial differential equations, we often find huge matrices.

00:01:49.980 --> 09:59:59.000
They are an ideal workload for GPUs.
