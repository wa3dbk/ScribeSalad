00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, this is very easy to check.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can just run it in the IDE and see what comes out.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The answer is 8, but why is the answer 8?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's take a look at what 17 looks like in binary, in base 2.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It has the 1 position set--1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a bit pattern that looks like this--10001.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What this operator does is it shifts the whole bit pattern

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
one position to the right, dropping the lower order bit.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This shift 1 to the right becomes that, which is 8.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Roughly, what this operator does is it halves a number.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But if it's odd first it subtracts 1 and then halves the number.

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's why we get 8 and not say 8.5.
