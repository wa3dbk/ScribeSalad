00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A topic highly related to the finite element method is computational fluid dynamics--CFD--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the study of gases and liquids with the help of the computer.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
For instance, to find the optimum shape of an airfoil or the optimum shape of a car body

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or to design hydraulic machinery.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I've titled this section "Why CFD is hard,"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so now let's look into that.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If we were looking at a single particle of mass m that is subject to a force F

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then the rate of change of the velocity would be proportional to that force.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That's one of Newton's laws--force equals mass times acceleration,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which is the rate of change of velocity,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the derivative of velocity with respect to time.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
For the fluid, something similar has to happen,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but now we're not dealing with a single particle.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We're dealing with a virtually infinite amount of particles.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What we are working with is not the velocity of the particle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's the velocity field.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
For every position in space, we specify the velocity,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so the velocity that we specify is the velocity of that particle

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
at that instant of time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Before and after, most probably, this location is going to be occupied

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
by other particles at other times.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
When we write down Newton's equation for this particle--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
force equals mass times the derivative of velocity with respect to time--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We have to be a little careful.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's look at what happens after a very short time step.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's mass times 1 over the time step,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and now we have to form the difference of the velocity after that time step

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
minus the velocity before that time step.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The before part is easy.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's simply our velocity field at the current time and the current location.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The tricky thing is the after part.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's the velocity field at the later time--t plus time step.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now we have to take care of the fact that our particle has moved a little.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We don't need the velocity field at that later time.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
At position x it has to be a slightly different position,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
namely, how far did we advance?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We advanced by time step times velocity.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, this is going to make things ugly.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The velocity field of something that includes the velocity field.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
A function applied to itself.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is what makes things ugly and eventually leads to computational fluid dynamics

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and eventually leads to computational fluid dynamics being hard.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
If we do the math right, this becomes the following.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
First we have to look into the change of the velocity field with time,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
so we get its partial derivative with respect to time.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But then we also have to look into its change with position,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
which is the partial derivative with respect to x, for instance.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The larger the velocity is, the more effect the spatial derivative has.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
What we get in the end is the x component of the velocity times the partial derivative

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
of the velocity with respect to x.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Of course, the same happens with y and z.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
This is going to be the acceleration,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and this is inherently nonlinear.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We have a product of a function that we're looking for--the velocity field--with itself.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is going to make solving the differential equation that results from this really hard.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Finally, however, even though the resulting equation--

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the so-called Navier Stokes equation--is going to look pretty complex,

00:03:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
it's nothing else but Newton's law applied to the velocity field.
