00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.336
We decide that if the probability of obtaining a particular sample mean is less

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:08.951
than the alpha level. Then it will fall in this tail which is called the

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:13.492
critical region. This z score value, which cuts off the critical region from

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:18.962
the rest of the distribution, is called the z critical value. If the z score of

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:24.840
a sample mean is greater than the z critical value. We have evidence that these

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.310
sample statistics are different from the regular or untreated population. In

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.490
our example, this was the population that had not watched the musical lesson.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:42.332
Let's say that the probabililty of this red critical region, is 0.05, or 5%. In

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:48.253
other words, the alpha level is .05. Then what is this c critical value here?
