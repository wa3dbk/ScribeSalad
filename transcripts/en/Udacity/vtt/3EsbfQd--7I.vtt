00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.880
Service workers implies some subtle
changes and application architecture.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.290
Rather than squashing all of your
application into an HTML string,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.210
we need to do things AJAX style.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.740
Request the data asynchronously
from the server and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.960
then update the local DOM to match.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.790
This is where you have a shell
that's always cast and

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.780
can always boot up without the network.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.740
And the content that is refreshed
regularly and managed separately.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.950
So, what goes into
the application shell?

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.700
The first step is to break the design
down into it's core components.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.365
Ask yourself,
what needs to be on screen immediately?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.910
What other UI components
are key to our app?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.210
What supporting resources are needed for
the app shell?

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.680
For example, JavaScript, Styles, etc.
