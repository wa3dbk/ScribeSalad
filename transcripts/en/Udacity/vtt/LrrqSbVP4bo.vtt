00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.900
When you did your programming with Sarah, it's quite possible that some things

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.635
went wrong and you got some nasty error messages. When you learn a new

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:11.440
langauge, be it a human language or a programming language, errors are a fact

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.320
of life. Let me show you some common errors so that you can recognize and fix

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.250
them. Here's a typical error. Have a quick look and see if you can tell which

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.167
part is wrong. That can't be right, the terminal window object was system.out

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:32.580
not system.ouch. Let's see what happens if one makes such an error. You may

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.080
want to work along with me here in Blue Jay. Open the errors project and open

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.920
error 1. Here is the error. Let's compile and the compiler, the program that

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.520
translate Java into lower-level code complains and says it has no idea what the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.320
variable ouch is. The compiler knows system.out, it doesn't know system.ouch.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.940
Such an error is called a compile time error because it's found when you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.260
compile. Some people call it a syntax error because there's something wrong

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.660
with the syntax of this statement here. As you can imagine there are lots of

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.610
syntax errors you could make. You might forget the semicolon. You might forget

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.370
one of these quotation marks or both. You might forget one of these dots. Any

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.830
time you do that the compiler will complain and you just fix that particular

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.520
error and recompile. It happens to the best of us. Now here we have a different

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.810
kind of error, again have a look and see if you can guess. The programmer

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.940
misspelled world, let's see what happens in this case. When you compile,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.640
there's no error, the compiler doesn't know English. And it has no idea that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.540
this part has been misspelled. We can run the program and it runs. It just does

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.040
the wrong thing. When a program compiles and runs but it produces the wrong

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.750
output, then that's called a run time error. Some people call it a logic error

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.270
because there's something wrong with the logic of the program not just it's

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.640
syntax. Now have a look at this statement, it also has an error. What do you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.780
think will happen when you try to compile and run a program containing this

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.750
statement? Do you think it doesn't even compile? Do you think that it compiles

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.070
and runs but then it prints the wrong value? Like in this case. Or will it

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.130
compile and run and then print an error message? Or will your keyboard melt

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.665
into a puddle of plastic? If you have BlueJ open right now, just give it a

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:30.110
quick try.
