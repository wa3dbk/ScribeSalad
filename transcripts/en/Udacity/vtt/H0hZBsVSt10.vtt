00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.969
Let's talk a little bit ,about how to implement consistent

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.920
hashing. One option is for every node to know the

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.620
location of every other node. In this case, lookups are

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.810
fast. In fact, they are order one, but the routing

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.730
tables are large. In particular, because every node needs to

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.300
know the location of every other node in the network.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.230
The routing table, must be order N, where n is

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.890
the number of nodes in the network. So ,for example,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.660
if node 32 wanted to look up the location

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.800
of Annie Hall, that value might hash to 60,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340
and if every node maintains a routing table entry

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.730
for every other node, 32 would know that the key

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.260
corresponding to ID 60 was located at node one.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.330
So the look up, would be order one, but the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.960
table ,would be order N. Another option, is that

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.520
each node, only knows the location of its immediate successor

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.910
in the ring. So for example ,node 32, would

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.280
know the location of node 43, but of no

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.990
other node. This results in a small table, of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.470
size order one. But locating the content, as before,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.090
would require order N lookups. So in summary, if

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.610
every node knows the location of every other node,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.100
then lookups have good performance at the expense of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.800
larger tables. If every node only knows its successor ,then

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.870
routing tables can be small, but every lookup operation is order N.
