00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In turns out that there is one stable equilibrium and one unstable equilibrium

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and now, we will discuss the details.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's take this equation and put it in this form so it's easier to see what has to be balanced.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The force divided by the mass has to balance the deceleration by the brake.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The force can be expressed with the help of the friction coefficient, the mass of 1/4 of the car,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the gravitational acceleration.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So this equation boils down to the following--that the coefficient of friction has to equal

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the deceleration of the wheel over the gravitational acceleration times the ratio of the masses

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and now we can check with our diagram what this means.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If we brake with an intensity slightly below the optimum, the coefficient of friction

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
has to be on such a line slightly below its maximum value.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This has to be the value of our coefficient of friction and hence, of the right hand side.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We have two options to satisfy this equality and hence, two possible equilibria.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This value of s and this value of s. The lower one is stable. The upper one is unstable.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I just illustrate one part of the argument for that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Imagine s was a little lower than the value of the equilibrium, then we would have less friction

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
because the coefficient of friction decreases, but if we have less friction,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the brake acts stronger on the wheel, which means it's going to increase wheel slip

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and moving in that locking direction, which means upward.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
From the left side, this equilibrium is stable.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
When we are slightly below, this equilibrium point if you're moving up and you can argue

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in a similar fashion that we are slightly below that point if we are moving down.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
For this point, it's the other way around.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If we are slightly below, we keep on moving down. If we're slightly above, we keep on moving up.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Once we are past that point, we inevitably run into locking a wheel slip of one

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and strictly speaking, there is a 3rd equilibrium which is stable again.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When the wheel slip is one, that means when the wheel is locked the deceleration by the brake

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
always supersedes the force applied through friction.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We are going to stay in that locked state.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
There is a practical consequence of this--if you push the break too hard,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
you're inevitably going to lock the wheels, which is far less than optimal.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
If we really stump on the breaks, there is no equilibrium below s=1 at all.

00:02:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
No matter what, we're going to end up with locked wheels.
