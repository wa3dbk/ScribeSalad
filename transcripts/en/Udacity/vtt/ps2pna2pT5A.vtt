00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.558
Well to isolate y, we'll start by subtracting 3 from both sides. This will give

00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:11.111
us 2 y on the right side, and x minus 3 on the left side. Now we just divide

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:16.421
both sides of our equation by 2 to get 1 y equal to x minus 3, all divided by

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:21.600
2. Great thinking if you found this expression.
