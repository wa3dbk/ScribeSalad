00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.440
Beyond these programs there's a need
to change incentives in at least

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.980
three ways.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.630
The first is reimbursement for

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.390
the expense of the electronic
health record system.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.640
The second is some ongoing financial
incentive to use the system properly.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.659
The Medicare and Medicaid incentive
programs were designed to do the first.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.570
The Medicare payment program may do
the second through penalties for

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.980
providers in hospitals who
don't achieve meaningful use.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.930
It's increasingly possible that private
health insurance companies may start

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.260
funneling patients to providers who
have achieved meaningful use and

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.459
the prospect of that
is another incentive.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.090
The third needed incentive is changing
reimbursement to some form of pay for

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.160
performance to further
reward providers for

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.800
improving care efficiency and quality.
