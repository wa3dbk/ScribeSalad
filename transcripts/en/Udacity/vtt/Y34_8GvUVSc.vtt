00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.620
In Material Design,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.730
there are two primary forms of visual
feedback in response to touch.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.000
The first is a subtle ripple effect
that radiates outward from your finger,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.070
extending to the bounds of
the surface that it's drawn on.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.990
For borderless elements,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.370
the ripple extends out just enough to
give you a sense of the element's size.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.990
We sometimes call this an ink ripple.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.080
Because we liken to a wave of
digital ink spreading on a surface.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.860
Almost like a droplet of ink falling and
spreading on a piece of paper.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.080
This idea of radial motion emanating
from your fingertip is a key

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.820
theme in material design that we'll
touch on more in lesson three.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.330
User initiated radial response not only
puts the user in control of the UI, but

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.350
it will make the UI really
satisfying to use as well.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.270
Now, let's look at the second
form of visual feedback.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.730
For smaller interactive
surfaces like buttons,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.380
the surface itself can
lift to meet your finger.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.940
Almost like your finger is
magnetically attracting that surface.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.250
So you see here that the fab rises to
meet my finger as I'm pressing it.
