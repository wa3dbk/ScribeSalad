00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.675
Now our suburban scene was quaint, but it was rather static. Let's add a second

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:09.500
interface to add some motion. The moveable interface has a method move, and we

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.800
give the number of seconds for the simulated motion. Now, cars are moveable,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.410
our car class implements two interfaces, drawable, and movable. let's see how

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.573
that start. The car class now needs to implement the methods of both the

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:30.921
drawable and the movable interface. Here is the draw method that we've always

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:35.145
had, here is the move method we'll arbitrarily say that these cars moves at 10

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:40.625
pixel per second. And each of the components of the car is moved by that

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:46.617
amount. What's it look like? When you run the program, you can see this car

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:52.415
here moving. Later, we'll move the other cars as well, but for now please go

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:56.053
ahead and move Fido as well.
