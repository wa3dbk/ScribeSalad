Good to see you back for unit 4!

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.541
I'm sure you asked yourself after the last unit

00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:06.674
just what do we do with this scan primitive?

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:08.243
Well, today we're going to find out.

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:10.011
We're going to look at applications of scan,

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:11.923
and then we're going to learn how to sort on the GPU.

00:00:11.923 --> 00:00:14.468
So let's get started.
