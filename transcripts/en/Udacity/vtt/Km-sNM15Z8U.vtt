00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.300
Let's take a closer look if we have solved

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.950
the problem. First of all, virtual machines are nowadays

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.100
a standard offering by any cloud service provider. You

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.780
rent any number of virtual machines. And you pay by

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.650
the hour, or minute or so. This is called

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.500
IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service. This is, because a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.630
computer and therefore also a virtual machine, can be

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.940
considered infrastructure today. So getting back to our original picture.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.200
Problem solved, right? We could use standard virtual

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.990
machines from any cloud service provider. And achieve unlimited

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.110
scalability by distributing the execution of our application, across

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.820
these virtual machines. On a high level, it may

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.920
appear so. But let's look at what you

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.040
need to do to actually realize this architecture. And

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.600
as it turns out, creating this architecture for your

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.030
application is a very complicated and resource intensive problem.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.030
Let's look at some of the things you need to think about and take care of.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.070
VM Management. Starting and stopping the virtual machine.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.510
Operating system images. Software

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.250
management. Installing, patching and upgrading.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.350
A powerful web server. Installing it and configuring

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.350
it for the correct settings. A distributed database

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.180
where you can read and write data, from

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.980
all of your virtual machines. A distributed file system,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.380
where you can read and write data which is accessible from all your virtual

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.340
machines. Application monitoring, with a consolidated view

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.250
of any problems occurring in your distributed execution

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.900
environment. Availability including data replication, hardware software

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.030
resilience, geographic disaster recovery strategies. Back ups, recovery,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.350
automatic fail overs, et cetera. Security set

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.900
up and management in your distributed execution environment.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.790
And load balancing. How to spread the load across the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.430
VMs, including application level session management. And all of the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.400
other things that we did not have space to list

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.250
here. As you can see, this is an extremely complex problem

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.000
to solve in a scalable way. So even though our

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.510
solution looked good on a high level. We have now

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.450
created an architecture that requires a monumental engineering effort to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.620
realize. At the same time, as you have limited amount of

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.470
time and resources. Remember that we started the service

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.100
side history, by looking at the server sitting under the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.800
office desk. And sadly enough, for many projects we

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.590
have reached a present day. These are the challenges many

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.070
projects are facing today, when trying to build scalable

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.610
systems. Now, let's do a reality check with a question

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.140
for you. Since you have limited time and resources, select

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.300
three of these problems you would prioritize over the others.
