00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's quickly summarize how a language interpreter works.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For regular expressions we have patterns like a or b plus, which define languages.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A language is a set of strings like {a, b, ab, ba, ...} and so on, defined by that pattern.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then we have interpreters like matchset, which in this case takes a pattern and a text

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and returns a list of strings or a set of strings.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So we saw that matchset is an interpreter because it takes a description of the language,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
namely a pattern as a data structure, and operates over that pattern.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here's the definition of matchset.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You see it looks at the pattern, breaks out its components,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and then the first thing it does is this big case statement to figure out

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
what type of operator we have and to do the appropriate thing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There's an inherent inefficiency here in that the pattern is defined once,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and it's always the same pattern over a long string of text and maybe over many possible texts.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We want to apply the same pattern to many texts.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yet every time we get to that pattern, we're doing this same process

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
of trying to figure out what operator we have

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
when, in fact, we should already know that, because the pattern static, is constant.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So this is kind of repeated work. We're doing this over and over again for no good reason.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There's another kind of interpreter called a "compiler"

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which does that work all at once.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The very first time when the pattern is defined we do the work of figuring out

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which parts of the pattern are which so we don't have to repeat that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
every time we apply the pattern to a text.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Where an interpreter takes a pattern and a text and operates on those,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
a compiler has two steps.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In the first step, there is a compilation function, which takes just the pattern

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and returns a compiled object, which we'll call C.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then there's the execution of that compiled object

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
where we take C and we apply that to the text to get the result.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Here work can be done repeatedly every time we have a text.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Here the work is split up. Some of it is done in the compilation stage to get this compiled object.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Then the rest of it is done every time we get a new text. Let's see how that works.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Here is the definition of the interpreter.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Let's focus just on this line here.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This say if the op is a literal, then we return this result.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The way I'm going to change this interpreter into a compiler is I'm going to take

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the individual statements like this that were in the interpreter,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and I'm going to throw them into various parts of a compiler,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and each of those parts is going to live in the constructor for the individual type of pattern.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We have a constructor--literal takes a string as input and let's return a tuple

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that just represents what we have, and then the interpreter deals with that.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now, we're going to have literal act as a compiler.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
What it's going to do is return a function that's going to do the work.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
What is this saying?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We have the exact same expression here as we had before,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but what we're saying is that as soon as we construct a literal rather than

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
having that return a tuple, what it's returning is a function,

00:03:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which is a function from the text to the result that matchset would have given us.
