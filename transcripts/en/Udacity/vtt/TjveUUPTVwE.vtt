We know that A equals P times e to the rt. We're looking for A, and here's what

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:17.122
we know. P equals 20,000, r equals 0.04, and t equals 5. Let's plug these

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:23.580
numbers in. That gives us 20,000 times e to the 0.2. Now, it's time to use our

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.176
calculator. I'll type in 20,000, multiply that by e and take e to the power of

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:35.040
0.2. Look at that, we managed to use all of the calculator skills we learned in

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.390
this lesson in one go. Now I will just press Enter and we'll see what happens.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.042
We get $24,428 and if we round, 6 cents. Grant definitely makes some more money

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.902
with continuously compounding interest than he did with the other options we

00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:52.290
checked out.
