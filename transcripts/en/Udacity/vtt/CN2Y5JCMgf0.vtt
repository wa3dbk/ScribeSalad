00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.100
Remember, the only criteria for

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.110
whether something would be a fast-forward merge is if the branch you

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.250
are merging into is an ancestor of the branch that you're merging from.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.540
This is an example of that.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.140
It's pretty clear.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.820
If you trace back from b you get to a.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.310
So this one would definitely be a fast-forward merge.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.890
In this case you can also get from b to a.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.560
There would be another way to go.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.660
But since this is in the history at all, we do check this one.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.850
Here there's no way to get to a from b.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.670
Nowhere in the line from b to the first commit do we find a.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.310
So here, no, we can't do a fast forward merge.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.600
We would have to create a new merge commit.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.550
Similarly, in this case, a is not in the path from b to the initial commit.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.810
So we can't do it here either.
