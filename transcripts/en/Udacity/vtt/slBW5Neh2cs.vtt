00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.593
Now, we have our general form of the confidence interval. So, for some y

00:00:03.593 --> 00:00:09.532
percent confidence interval, this could be 95%, 99%, anything really. Usually,

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:14.653
it's somewhere in the 90s. Then, the lower bound of the confidence interval is

00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:20.824
the sample mean minus the number of standard deviations away from the mean.

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:25.423
Where this z value is the number of standard deviations and sigma divided by

00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:32.130
the square root of n is the standard deviation of the sampling distributions.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.230
And then, on the upper bound, we just add the number of standard deviations

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.842
away that we want. If we have a 95% confidence interval, we'll have less

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:47.208
standard deviations away than we will for a 98% confidence interval. Remember

00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:52.330
that we get this z-value from the z-table. So, if this is a 98% confidence

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.180
interval let's say, then we'll have 1% in the tails. And then, we'd look for

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.538
the z-score for which 1% is less in a standard normal distribution. The

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:10.211
distance that we go away from x-bar, on either side, is the margin of error.

00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:16.510
And as you can see, that's equal to z times sigma divided by root end. And

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.530
that's half the width of the confidence interval.
