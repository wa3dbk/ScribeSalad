00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.420
So, I want to know, what do you understand by

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.350
a distributed system and I am going to give you three

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.220
choices, nice perfectly fine if you don't get it right

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.980
but I just wanted to get you thinking in terms of

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.770
what a distributed system is and what your understanding is.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.620
The first choice says that a distributed system is a collection

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.310
of Nodes connected by a Local Area Network or a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.320
Wide Area Network. Second choice says that, a distributed system is

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.370
one in which communication happens only via messages. And

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.729
the third choice is that, a distributed system is

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.230
one in which events that are happening on the

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.740
same node, here like A and B. The time

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.160
between that is called the event time. And the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.490
event that is happening across nodes, which is a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.970
communication event, Node N1 sends a message to node

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.880
N2, it's a communciation event from A to C. So,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.630
the third choice is saying that communication time

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.410
TM, is much more Significantly more than the event

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.050
execution time. That is the third choice so

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.630
you have three choices and I want you to

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.940
think about what's your definition, what's your mental

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.980
model of distributed system is and how any of

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.280
these choices fit or do not fit your mental

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.420
model of what you think a distributed system is.
