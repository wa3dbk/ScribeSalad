00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.900
We're going to put everything, but
the data into the weather app's shell.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.100
The HTML contains a header,
an empty forecast card,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.040
a dialogue for adding new cities,
and the loading indicator.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.340
Notice that the forecast card and
the dialogue

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.570
are hidden by default and
the loading indicator is visible.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.790
We also need to include the styles and
any images our app needs to run.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.590
When designing a more complex app,
content that isn't needed for

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.740
the initial load can be requested
later and inCached for future use.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.100
For example, we could defer
the loading of the new city dialogue

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.390
until after the first run experienced
and we have some idle cycles available.
