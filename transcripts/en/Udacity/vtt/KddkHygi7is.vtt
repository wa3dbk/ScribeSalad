00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.149
Great, so
what's the efficiency of this algorithm?

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.760
Well, we had to go through pretty
much the whole array a lot of times.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.640
Here's roughly what we did.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.823
Overall we had to do four or
n -1 iterations, and

00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:18.690
at each step we did n- 1 comparisons.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.630
So n- 1 comparisons for and n- 1
iterations gives us something like this.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.730
We can use a little algebra to
figure out what this simplifies to.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.640
And we get something
that looks like this.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.840
Again, don't worry too much
if you can't do the algebra.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.420
The minus one isn't changing much for
us so

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.380
you could always just do n
times n equals n squared.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.440
Thus, we really don't need
this minus -2n+1 bit.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.800
We can get rid of it and

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.980
that leaves us with this is
efficiency big o of n squared.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.920
Actually there's a way we could have
saved ourselves some time with this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.940
algorithm.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.800
If you noticed each time we went
through the array we compared the last

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.960
few values even though we really
didn't need to after a while.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.390
It made sense to compare 7 and
8 when we were bubbling up 7.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.380
But when we were bubbling up
some of the lower numbers

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.560
this comparison didn't
really change anything.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.220
The most common version of Bubble Sort
actually leaves out this step

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.400
every time of comparing the last few
when you really don't need to do that.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.330
It assumes that after the first
iteration you know that eight

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.410
is in the right place.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.600
So you don't need to check it
against anything else later.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.399
Again this will save us some time but

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.320
it's not going to change our overall
run time of big O of n squared.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.250
I have a couple quick notes for
you okay.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.250
So we understand by the worst case and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.610
the average case are going
to be big O of n squared.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.590
However, the best case is
actually going to be big O of n.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.700
The best case would either be that the
array was already sorted in which we can

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.310
just go through it once see that sorted
and not have to do anything else or if

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.600
there's only one number that needs to be
bubbled up to a new place in the array.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.370
And one last thing, we didn't have to
use anything extra to do our sort.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.410
We had no extra arrays, no extra
data structures, nothing like that.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.400
Bubble Sort is a great example of
an in-place sorting algorithm,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.300
so the space complexity is constant.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.100
Meaning we didn't need any extra arrays
or data structures in the whole process.
