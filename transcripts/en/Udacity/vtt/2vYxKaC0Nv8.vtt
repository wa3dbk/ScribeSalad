00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.274
All of these Exception types we've seen are part of an Exception Hierarchy. They

00:00:04.274 --> 00:00:08.542
inherit from the Exception class. The Standard Error type is a sub-class of

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:12.476
Exception. And they're many different sub-classes of Standard Error, including

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:16.181
the Assertion Error. This is the one that gets raised when an Assertion fails.

00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:20.762
The Environment Error, and this gets raised when something in the execution

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:24.894
environment is not as we expect. An example of an Environment Error, is the IO

00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:28.721
Error that we saw when we couldn't read a file. An IO Error is a subtype of

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:32.942
Environment Error which is a subtype of Standard Error which is a subtype of

00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:37.885
Exception. This is why when we have Exception It handles an IO Error, as well as

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:41.986
an Assertion Error. Another type of Error would be a Lookup Error. This happens

00:00:41.986 --> 00:00:45.193
when something we're looking for doesn't exist. And there are two kinds of

00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:49.639
Lookup Errors. An Index Error that happens when we access outside the bounds of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:53.888
a list, for example. And a Key Error that happens when we look for a key that

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.793
doesn't exist in the dictionary.
