00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Why do startups fail? Well, the answer is really all of the above.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Co-founders do fight.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Somewhere between a quarter and third of startups

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
never even get to the beginning of the company because the founders just couldn't agree.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Two is that sometimes your vision is just too far in advance to actually be built.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The three is it's such an interesting vision or such a bad vision,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but it can't attract sufficient capital to get started

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and it's maybe too expensive to fund on your own through your own resources.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the one we'll be actually talking about in some detail during the series of lectures

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is that you never actually found product market fit and there's too few people

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
who will buy or will use the product.
