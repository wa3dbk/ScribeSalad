00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.550
We now understand that cancer
is a far more complex family of

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.580
diseases than previously thought.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.610
And that the results of treatment
in any individual patient

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.490
depends on their particular genomic,
proteomic, and metabolic pathways,

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.310
other personal factors, and
on similar factors in the cancer.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.220
Given the high mutation rate in cancers,
there's usually

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
one more than one cell type, essentially
more than one cancer in each patient.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.910
Traditional chemotherapy
is a metabolic poison.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.200
It selectively targets
rapidly growing cells and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.270
works because cancer cells divide
more rapidly than normal cells.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.810
However, our bone marrow,
hair cells, and

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.490
the lining of the GI tract
also grow rapidly and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.340
are attacked by the treatments, leading
to side effects that can be awful.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.470
More recently, we've developed
mechanistic treatments that have far

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.560
fewer side effects because they
selectively attack metabolic pathways

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.300
in the cancer if it has the specific
pathway that the treatment targets.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.460
These are very expensive treatments, and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.640
precious time is lost
if they don't work.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.350
Without an analytic tool,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.400
it's hard to know which patients
will benefit from a therapy.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.140
This research was aimed at
developing a predictive model

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.310
to assist physicians in selecting the
right mechanistic drug for each patient.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.570
It's based on a comprehensive model
of known cancer biochemical pathways,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.590
a small part of which is shown here.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.670
The blue boxes are the components.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.520
And the red circles are their
reactions with each other.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.580
The researchers report then when
genomic data from the patient and

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.750
from the primary cell types in their
cancer, including cancer stem cells,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.770
if possible, are fed,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.880
the model has successfully predicted
the efficacy of treatment.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.230
It's now being
commercialized by Alacris,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.250
a startup company in Germany
where the research was done.
