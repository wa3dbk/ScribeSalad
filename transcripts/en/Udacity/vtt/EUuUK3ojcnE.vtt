00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.740
So a few times in my career I've ended
up in situations where we've had to

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.570
pivot and it's mostly based on the
assumptions that we had or the theory

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.540
that we were trying to test just
didn't work out for whatever reason.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.360
Or a partner had a different opinion.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.130
So, in one of my tech startups we did
a technical demo that failed and so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.650
we pivoted into a new
technical direction.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.370
Based on the technology we had

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.530
which also didn't work out
the way we had anticipated.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.060
So we pivoted again and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.220
ended up acquiring a small company in
business and trying to work that into

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.990
our core business which turned
out not to be lucrative so

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.270
that changed the conditions upon
which we were operating our business.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.481
So we pivoted again into
a completely different category of

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:51.114
technology business while still
trying to leverage that initial

00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:53.400
seed of technology that we had.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.772
The perception for
me was we were running amok,

00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:59.300
we were just like wildly thrashing
around and it wasn't acceptable.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.709
So, at that point I stepped back
personally and just sort of took stock

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.535
of what we had and what I believed in at
that point, went back to my core values.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:13.855
And went back to our first idea and
decided on a reimplementation of that.

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:16.935
And that actually gave the company
the engineering direction

00:01:16.935 --> 00:01:19.235
it needed to launch a product.

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:21.405
It only took six years.
