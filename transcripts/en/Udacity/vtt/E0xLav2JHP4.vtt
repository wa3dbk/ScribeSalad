00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.740
Welcome back, and as before, you have
a rich playground for future reference.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.810
Check it out, we will go through
all the code right here.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.150
So far, it looks like a closure, and is
a function with a few extra features and

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.240
a slightly different syntax.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.630
Not so, little grasshopper.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.210
Functions and
closures are exactly the same thing.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.280
They just have a different syntax.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.470
Therefore, all the extras that closures
pack are also available to functions.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.490
Closures and functions are just like
our alter egos for the same thing.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.870
Like Peter Parker and Spiderman.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.280
So the function enclosure that
I'm going to show you right now

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.620
are exactly equivalent.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.380
They don't just do the same thing.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.270
Check them out.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.440
They are the same thing.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.287
So we have first a function
that takes an integer and

00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:54.428
returns an integer and it adds 42 to it.

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:57.670
And then we have a closure that
does exactly the same thing.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.960
They look equivalent, but actually
they are more than just equivalent.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.300
They are exactly the same thing.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.720
Actually when the compiler finds
a function declaration such as foo

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.460
over here,
it will take the following steps.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.670
First of all, create a closure
that takes an integer and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.845
returns 42 + that integer.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:22.270
And then assign that closure
to a constant called foo.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.180
Sounds familiar, yeah.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.960
That's exactly what you've done here for
bar.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.850
So the bottom line is since functions
and closures are the same thing,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.450
you should use whatever syntax
makes more sense at a given time.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.880
It's up to you to choose which one
you prefer at any given point.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.520
So if closures and functions are exactly
the same thing we should be able to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.270
add functions to a collection,
such as an array,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.710
as we did with the closures in
the previous playground certainly.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.740
So let's give it a try.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.350
I'm going to show you a few functions
and then we'll add them to an array and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.410
iterate through the array, and call
the functions, just as we did before.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.260
So, here we have three functions that
take an integer, and return an integer.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.380
Just like those that we've seen before.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.080
And we're going to add them to an array,
and see if it works.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.600
And it certainly does work.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.720
Here we have the three
functions with in the array.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.270
So could we add the bar closure
over here to this array?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.550
Think about it.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.170
Yes.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.880
They have the same type and
it doesn't matter

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.120
if they were defined using the closure
syntax or the functioned one.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.790
Let's add it.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.795
And now we can just call
all those functions and

00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.118
closures that are inside stooges.

00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:46.100
So for, and
again it works exactly as expected.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.790
And we can display it
also as a line graph.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.610
So now I have a question for you.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.550
Could we add the function baz
that is here, to this array?

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.770
Think about it, or try it if you must,
but you shouldn't need it by now.
