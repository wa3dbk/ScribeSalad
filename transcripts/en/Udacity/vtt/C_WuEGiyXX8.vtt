[Norvig] The answer is shuffle2 is still order N squared,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and you can see that because it's similar to shuffle1 in the way it goes through

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and checks off the elements that are swapped.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But it is in fact correct.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It does give a balanced result that any outcome is equally likely,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and you can see that by running the shuffler test on it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Shuffle3, on the other hand, has a nice order N runtime,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but unfortunately, it's not correct. It's biased in the results that it produces.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So in conclusion, we should stick to the original shuffle--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that is, not the teacher's function, not any attempts to fix it up,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but the one I was able to come up with in class

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and the one that's in the literature of Knuth and others.
