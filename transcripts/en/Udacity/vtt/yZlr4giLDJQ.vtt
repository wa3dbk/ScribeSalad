00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.250
Now the work in span laws
tell you something about

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.590
the minimum possible time.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.160
But I want you to ask yourself
a more interesting question.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.840
Is there an upper bound on
the time to execute the DAG?

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.330
The answer is, yes,
according to a theorem by Richard Brent.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.759
Now, I love Brent's result.

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.610
I think it's really cool and
really elegant.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.680
Personally, I think you can get a lot
of insight into parallel algorithms

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.620
by re-deriving it.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.200
And you can do so without a lot of work.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.088
Now having said that, there are a bunch
of steps involved so I'm going to break

00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:36.020
this derivation into two parts, and
we'll have a small quiz in-between.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.570
So we have a DAG with a certain
amount of work and a particular span.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.490
Just as a reminder,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.960
our goal is to estimate an upper
bound on its execution time.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.250
Now suppose I give you
a PRAM with P processors and

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.450
let's say you run the DAG.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.700
Now let's imagine we're doing some
forensic analysis and we go back and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.670
we look at the execution
of the DAG on the PRAM.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.470
Let's break up that
execution into phases,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.440
where each phase satisfies
three conditions.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.880
The first condition is that each phase
has exactly one critical path vertex.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.500
Note that this condition
immediately implies that there have

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.759
to be D(n) phases.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.770
So let's say I've numbered the critical
path vertices from 1 to D(n).

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.210
Then this condition implies
that there will be D(n) phases.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.310
So here's a cartoon of what
the phases might look like.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.390
Now since the critical path
vertices are numbered, and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.560
there's one critical
path vertex per phase,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.150
then I can number the phases by
the critical path for text number.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.060
So for
example here's critical path vertex 2 so

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.165
I'll call this phase, phase 2.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.277
Okay, that's the first condition,
what about the second?

00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:52.835
The second condition is that all non
critical path vertices within a phase

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:54.860
are independent.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.620
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.920
Let's take any phase with its single
critical path vertex, like this one.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.550
Now consider any non critical path
vertices that have been assigned to

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.200
this phase.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.820
These vertices can only have edges that
enter the phase or exit the phase, but

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.590
they can never depend on one another.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.560
So for example, this is okay, but

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.720
a dependence like this
would not be allowed.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.550
Now this condition is always
possible to satisfy, and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.100
a good exercise is to see
if you can figure out why.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.930
As a hint, just think about paths,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.980
and the fact that the critical path
vertex lies on the longest path.

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:38.960
Now, there's a third condition which
is that every vertex has to be in

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.940
some phase, and further more it
should only be in one phase.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.680
So suppose this is our DAG, and
let's say we've divided it into phases.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.910
Now every phase K will have some
number of vertices associate with it.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.020
Let's say that number is WK.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.490
And this value WK will include
the critical path vertex.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.610
So by this third condition,
which says that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.670
every vertex has to appear in exactly
one phase, what does that imply?

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.770
It basically tells us if I add up
the WKs across all the phases,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.090
then I should get the total
number of vertices.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.330
That is, the sum of WK for
K goes from 1 to D should be W.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.600
Okay, here's a question for you.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.300
How long will it take
to execute phase K?

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.710
Let's call that time tK.

00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:37.200
Now if I have WK units
of independent work,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.185
which I get from condition two,
then that tells me that the total

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:46.827
time to execute phase K should
be ceiling of WK divided by P.

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:51.633
And that in turn implies that
if I sum over all phases then

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:55.555
the total time is just
the sum of these tK's.

00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:58.615
So plugging in tK we get this summation.

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:02.195
Okay, I know what you're thinking,
this seems really unhelpful.

00:04:02.195 --> 00:04:04.265
Are we any closer to achieving our goal?

00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:09.405
Mathematically these ceilings are really
ugly, and can we make them go away?
