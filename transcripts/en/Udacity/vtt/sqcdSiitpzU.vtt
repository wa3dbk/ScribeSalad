00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.160
So you have a good understanding
of focus styles and

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.750
leveraging Aria in your CSS.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.600
We've also talked about the double
when you get from using fluid and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.270
responsive styles in your app, to both
improve the multi device experience and

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.555
accessibility.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:16.065
The last series I want to touch
on are the roles that color and

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.785
contrast should play
in your application.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.975
If you have good vision, it's really
easy to fall into the trap of thinking

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:23.905
that everyone perceives colors or

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:28.675
text legibility the same way that you
do, but evidence proves otherwise.

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:31.695
So let's wrap things up by looking at
how we can effectively use color and

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:34.955
contrast to create pleasant designs
that are accessible to everyone.
