00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.788
&gt;&gt; Fantastic. Now the preDrawCache function has some tricky math that we'll go

00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:07.559
ahead and walk through here. The first thing we'll need to do is determine the

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.284
number of canvases that we're going to use along the x and y-axis. To do this,

00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:15.119
we actually divide the entire pixel size by the canvas tile size and then floor

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.774
the value. Note that we add the 1 here to round up, ensuring that any pixels

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:22.668
that fall outside of this division operation are actually covered and added to

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:28.151
our canvas. From there, we do a simple 2-dimensional for loop that walks through

00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:32.925
and creates a new canvas tile and set the x and y values equal to the position

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:37.627
of x offset times tile size. Once that's done, we simply concatenate this new

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:42.354
canvas tile to the already created array. And then, we set fully loaded equal to

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:42.725
true.
