The domain is only going to contain values of x for which the function is

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.734
defined. Let's start off with the domain. The domain is just the set of inputs

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:14.380
over here, for which the function is defined. So, the only ones that actually

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.658
map two values over in the f of x oval are 1, 2, and 4. So, those values

00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:24.046
together are the set that is our domain. Since 3 and 5 aren't actually paired

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:28.302
with anything, over here in f of x. In other words, if you plug these inputs

00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:32.806
into the function, you won't get a output, they are not part of our domain. Now,

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:38.180
our range it's a set of values that the domain values map to. So that's going to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.730
be 20 from the 1, the 2 maps to 80, and then 4 maps to 80 as well. But since 80

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.970
is already in the set, we don't repeat it. Now remember, this does still count

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.392
as a function even though there's a shared value in the range between two values

00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:54.300
in the domain.
