00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.530
F times g of 2 equals 24. Great thinking if you found this number. When we find

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.818
f times g of 2, we're really finding the product of these functions' outputs,

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:18.050
when their input is x equals 2. We know f of 2 equals 8. And g of 2 equals 3.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.212
So we really just need to multiply these two outputs together. And what do you

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:27.483
know, 8 times 3 equals 24, our answer.
