00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Next, let's take a look at a ring network.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, a chain network you can think of as being the relationship between a set of individuals

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with a direct chain--basically, for example, the relationship between me

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and my chain of ancestors.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This might be my son, who is connected to me, and I'm connected to my dad.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My dad is connected to my grandfather, and so on.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I actually don't know who my great-grandfather was. That's a chain network.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In a ring network, we actually now complete the loop,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which isn't a good representation of my family, I'm glad to say,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but lots of other things do have this sort of relationship.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As we can see in this particular example, we have a ring of 5 nodes and there are 5 edges--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
One thing that might be useful to do at this point is to look at what a ring network

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
like this might look like as a piece of code.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
For the purposes of this course, I'm going to represent graphs as dictionaries of dictionaries.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The way that that works is--let's take a look here.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What we're going to do is make a graph. We're going to call it a_ring.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We set it equal to 5 and we initialize the ring to be an empty dictionary--just { }.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then what we're going to do is to this empty graph we're going to start adding in edges.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The particular edges we're going to add in we're going to loop for each number from 0 to n - 1.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We're going to make a link in the ring from node i to node i+1 mod n.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's going to get us the wrap around at the very end.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What make_link does--and I'm going to use the same definition throughout--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is it takes a dictionary or graph and two nodes if we want to connect together,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
checks whether the first node is already in the graph.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If it is not, then it creates an empty dictionary for that node. Same thing for node 2.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Then it goes to the dictionary for node 1 in the graph and says that there is a connection

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
to node 2, so this basically just establishes the connection between node 1 and node 2

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so that later we can go and test for it if we want to.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Once we've created that dictionary, we can ask questions like, well, how many nodes

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
are in the graph and how many edges are in the graph?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I actually ran this already.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You can see that the number of nodes is indeed 5, which is good,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
because that's what we wanted it to be.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The number of edges--the way that we're calculating that is

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
by taking a look at all the nodes in the graph--in this case, the a_ring.keys()

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is giving us back a list of all of the names of the nodes in the graph.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We're going to assign the variable node to be each one of those in turn.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What we're going to do with that node is look up the dictionary for that node--

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in other words, look up all the connections that that node has in the graph,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and look up the length of that, put it together in a big list.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This list has one entry for each node in the graph,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and that entry is exactly how many edges that node has,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
which you may recall from last time is called the degree of the node.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This expression--actually, from this bracket here to this bracket here

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
gives us a list of the degrees of all the nodes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We sum all those up and now we've counted each edge twice,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
so we divide by 2 to get the total number of edges in the graph.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In this case, I then printed out the actual graph itself just so you can see what it looks like.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Five is the number of nodes. Five also happens to be the number of edges.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Because this is a ring, there is one edge coming out of each node

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and then wrapping back around to the front.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What it actually looks like internally is the list of the nodes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This could be any name at all as long as each node has a unique name.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I used numbers here, because it was really easy to do.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
There's node 0, node 1, node 2, node 3, and node 4.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
What node 0 is is a dictionary of all the nodes that it is connected to directly.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Node 0 in a five-node ring is connected to node 1, the node to its right,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and node 4, the node that would be one behind it with the wraparound.

00:03:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Similarly, 1 is connected to 0 and 2, 2 is connected to 1 and 3, and so on.
