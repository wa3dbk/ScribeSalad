Here is a tricky quiz question.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Say we alpha, our data weight to zero, and better, our smoothing weight, to 0.1,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we run this to completion. What do we get?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Your original path? The straight line connecting the initial the final location?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Or will everything collapse to a single point?

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You can try this out in the RDE before answering this quiz.
