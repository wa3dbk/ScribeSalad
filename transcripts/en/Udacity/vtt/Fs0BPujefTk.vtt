00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we want to understand the relationship between Identifier or variable names

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
(this means the same thing) and storage places,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
particular values as we're running our program; the state of the world.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If I write something like this in Javascript, it's going to return 2.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Conceptually, somewhere there's a box where we've made enough room

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to store the value 2, and we've labeled that with x.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Since this is a place for storing a value, we might call it a storage location or storage place.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If I write x=3, we need to go back to this box and update it with the new value,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because x can only have 1 value at a time in the same context.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So, if I declare another variable, it's going to make another box, another storage location.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We'll need to use more memory in the computer to store this value.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's see a more complete example.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here in this program we start off by initializing y to 2,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we declare a myfun function of x, it prints out x and then it prints out y,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and then we call a myfun of y plus 5.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
A little reasoning suggests that this is going to print out first the value of x,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
x is y plus 5, y is 2, so first we're going to print out 7,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and then we're going to print out y which was 2, 7 and 2.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, initially maybe our world looks a bit like this.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Y has the value of 2. But then when we call this function,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we're moving into a slightly new context

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that has to have room for x, it's actual argument.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The particular value we put in there is y plus 5, or 7, but we want to remember our roots.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I defined this function here right next to the place where y was equal to 2,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so when I'm in this context, printing out x and y,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I can get the value of x right here, and I may have to look a little farther to get the value of y,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but I can just trace the arrows and do it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Whenever we make a function call, it's going to get us a new box, new storage locations,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and I'm going to firm up this intuition in just a bit.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I realize it's very hand-wavy now.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Here's the quiz. I've written a Python program that has 3 print statements.

00:02:02.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I'd like you to tell me what each one prints out. Fill in the blanks.
