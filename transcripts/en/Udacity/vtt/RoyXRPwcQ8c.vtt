00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Our next guest is Vukosi Marivate, who is currently a graduate student in computer science.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He studies machine learning, but he's also a keen observer of the impact

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of technology on world cultures.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He's been in several technology companies,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and he's going to share some of his experiences with us.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We have with us Vukosi Marivate.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Vukosi lives in South Africa, and he's currently going to graduate school

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in the United States to get his PhD in computer science.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He has interned at a number of different companies,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and this summer he interned with a company called Meebo

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that does some social networking.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Can you tell me a little bit about Meebo?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What is it that they have been doing and where are they now?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
[Vukosi Marivate, Graduate Student, Rutgers University]

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Meebo was a company that did a couple of things.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
One was that they had a chat app.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Another is that they also did advertising through something called Meebo bar.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
They also then had a new product that was being developed

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to give you news, so you would actually log into the service,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
put up what your interests are, and you would either be friends with other people on the network,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and from there would actually mine the data that's created by all these people

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to actually now give you news and information that's relevant to you.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Do you have a sense of what sort of algorithmic work they had to do

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to support their company?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In most cases when you're looking at networks,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the things that are very interesting to do first

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
are dead simple ways to actually recommend who people should be friends with.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This goes across the spectrum whether you're on Facebook,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
on Linked In, on Twitter, or Meebo, and Google+.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The other things that become more interesting is finding out who's important in a graph.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This is actually not as simple as just looking at who has the most connections.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Either has the most followers or the most friends and things like that,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but actually be who is the person where information flows through.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
There are algorithms that try to actually do this,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and people are developing them using different metrics

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to try to figure out who's important given a topic, let's say.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Finding out who is very important given ice cream in California.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Those kinds of problems normally require you to do

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
some mathematical modeling of the networks that you have.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Do you have a sense of what a really simple example of an algorithm might be

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that would determine importance? Maybe not what people are really doing.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But something related to it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
One could be looking at giving keywords that people use.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Given who uses those keywords, and then looking at if a person uses that keyword,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
who then after that shares that keyword more and more.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Just looking at something that's called a "cascade"--

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
how information moves through a network,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but if you can look at the origin of where that keyword started

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and see how fast it grows, maybe, or how many people it gets to,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
you can then go back to figuring out who then is important.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So, if you can figure out, let's say, who is important in burgers, right,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
then you could then target advertising towards that person.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
You're advertising your product, and if they spread it, then you can then get to more people.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So, it's different to advertising a burger to me.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I probably don't have a lot of people who follow me because of my knowledge of burgers.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
But there could be other people out there who people follow because of their information,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
so if you can figure out who those people are, then you can advertise to them,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and they can spread information.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I did a project at Rutgers where it tried to figure out

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
who was important given an edu-tainment TV show.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In this case, I was trying to found out who was important in trying to spread information about HIV.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
In this case, it was not advertising but it's actually very important

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
in educating people.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
If you can figure out who spreads that information well,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
you get to more people and you can have more impact.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That seems really important--yeah.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I mean, not just--all over the world, right?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
There's these issues that are taking place.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
What's your sense of what social networks are like in other countries outside the United States?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Is it similar to the way it is here or are there variations?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Because of differing bandwidth constraints,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you have some social networks more used in some countries than others.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
You have countries that use Twitter, because it's very easy.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
To get on it's very low bandwidth, and also it spreads information very quickly.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
More quickly than Facebook, and it's open.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Obviously, everybody knows about the Arab Spring now,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and Twitter was very pivotal in that.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
In some countries there are other social networks that are very big there.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
They might not be big in the United States.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
In South Africa and some of most of Africa use something called "Mxit"--M-X-I-T,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
which is based in South Africa. It was created there.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It has a huge user base in South Africa.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I think Orchid is still very big in South America,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
which isn't quite as big as Google, but it's still spreading.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Just locally it's very big there.
