00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.795
Katrina travels at 10 miles per hour. Great work if you found this number. We

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:11.524
can start solving this equation by multiplying through by the LCD. The lowest

00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:15.904
common denominator in this case is x minus 5 times x plus 5, the product of

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:22.430
these two denominators. When we multiply we'll get 15 times x plus 5 here plus

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.079
15 times x minus 5 here. Equal to 4 times x minus 5 times x plus 5. I

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.670
multiplied these two binomials together since we have a minus b times a plus b.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.198
That's a squared minus b squared, our difference of squares pattern. Next we

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:43.794
distribute the 15 here and here and we distribute the positive 4 to get this

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:49.940
new equation. Combining like terms on the left side of the equation, we'll have

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.610
15x plus 15x which equals 30 x. The positive 75 and the negative 75 sum to 0.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.820
Next we want to try and factor this quadratic equation. So we'll need to move

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.890
this 30x over to the right hand side in order to set the quadratic equal to 0.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.245
I'll list the 4x square term first then the negative 30x term and then negative

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:17.430
100. All of these terms are even, so we can divide our entire equation by two.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.490
Here we'll want to use factoring by grouping in order to factor this quadratic.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.325
We find factors of 2 times negative 50, which is negative 100 that sum to

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:32.102
negative 15. Negative 20 and positive 5 multiply to give us negative 100 and

00:01:32.102 --> 00:01:38.515
they sum to negative 15. So we'll use these two numbers to rewrite negative 15x

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:44.370
as negative 20x plus 5x. Then we just use factoring by grouping to get two

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.441
factors of 2x plus 5 and x minus 10. We set each of these factors equal to 0 so

00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:56.695
x can equal 10, or x could equal negative 5 halves. We know x really represents

00:01:56.695 --> 00:02:02.340
Katrina's speed. So, we can't use the negative value. It's invalid. This is how

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.260
we know Katrina travels at 10 miles per hour.
