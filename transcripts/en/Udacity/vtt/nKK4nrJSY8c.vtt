00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.147
The answer is the second and the third I think are good reasons. The first one

00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:07.689
is not a good reason. Normally, shorter code is better than longer code. The

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.890
exception is if you get paid by the line, in which case you might prefer longer

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.919
code. This is why it's a bad policy to pay programmers by the line of code. The

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.450
second reason, errors are actually a good thing. We much prefer to get an error

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.620
than to get unexpected behavior. In this case, well, if we use the wrong name,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.794
we probably would have got the behavior we wanted. But, in general we want to

00:00:24.794 --> 00:00:28.820
program defensively, under the belief that usually it's better to get an error

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.430
than get an incorrect result. Of course, this depends a lot on what we're doing,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.630
and often it may be better to write code in such a way that the program survives

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.016
and keeps going instead of stopping with an error. So this is only usually true,

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:42.164
but it's always a good idea to program defensively. The third answer's

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:45.476
definitely true. One of our main goals as a programmer should be to make our

00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:48.724
code readable and maintainable. This means it's easy for someone else to

00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:51.844
understand what we're doing, and to make changes in the code without breaking

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:56.126
things. This is sometimes in conflict with making code concise. We do would want

00:00:56.126 --> 00:00:59.350
our code to be short, and generally the shorter the code the better, except

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.314
where making the code short makes it harder and harder for someone to

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:06.000
understand. As a general guideline If you're writing code that you think, if you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.355
came back to it a week later, you wouldn't understand what it does, that's

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:12.848
probably a bad idea. Much better to write the code in the simpler slightly

00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:15.939
longer way, than to do something really clever to make it short.
