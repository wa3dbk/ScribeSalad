00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.583
We divide each term by negative 7x squared. 21 divided by negative 7 equals

00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:09.327
negative 3, and x squared divided by x squared is equal to 1. So this first term

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:14.117
is simply negative 3. For the second one, I have 14 divided by negative 7, which

00:00:14.117 --> 00:00:18.758
equals negative 2. For the xes, I'll have one more x in the denominator than I

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:23.292
will in the numerator. So I have minus a negative 2 divided by x. We're

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:27.754
subtracting a negative number here. So really, this is just addition. And

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:32.369
finally, 42 divided by negative 7 equals negative 6, and then we're left with x

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.932
squared and the denominator. This one was pretty tricky, so great work if you

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:37.380
got it.
