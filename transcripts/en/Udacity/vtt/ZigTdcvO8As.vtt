00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.090
In addition to this
notion of domination,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.510
another thing that's
going to be helpful is,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.060
if I tell you a tale of two
operators for two policies.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.202
So imagine we've got policy Pi(1) and
policy Pi(2).

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:16.490
We're going to define the one step
Bellman operator on those two policies.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.620
So the first operator B1,
when we apply it to a value function V

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.020
is just going to return for each state
the immediate reward from that state.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.720
If we follow policy Pi1 plus
the discounted expected value for

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.980
following policy Pi1 with
one step look up on V.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.570
So we're converting V, we're basically
putting V through a one step value

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.700
iteration with a fixed policy Pi1,
and B2 is the same idea,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.056
same operator,
except with respect to policy two.

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:46.588
Pi2.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.120
Pi2.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.000
So, what we're going to be able to
show is various kinds of interesting

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.820
domination relationships between

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.290
the value functions that we get
out with each of these operators.
