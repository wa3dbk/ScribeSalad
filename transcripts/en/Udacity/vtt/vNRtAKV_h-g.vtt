&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, I'm Miriam. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And, I'm Julie and we're your instructors for College

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:08.077
Algebra, Animals, Architecture and Innovation. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You'll be seeing a lot of our

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.687
hands throughout the course, but we thought we would show you our faces too, so

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.469
you could get to know us better. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; For you people out there, who don't think

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.907
you are math people, we're out here to prove you wrong. Recent research has

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.097
shown that students who have difficulties learning mathematics, have

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.656
difficulties not because they're not smart, but because often they've had bad

00:00:25.668 --> 00:00:29.723
experiences learning mathematics. What's even better is that you can help your

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.543
brain grow through doing math. This course is designed to help you play around

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:37.201
with college algebra. Try to step out, make mistakes, try again, just get

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:41.077
involved with it. Research also shows that making mistakes helps with learning.

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:44.900
You're hear to learn about college algebra. We don't expect you to know

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.011
everything.

00:00:46.026 --> 00:00:49.013
And you're not alone either, we have thousands of students all over the world

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:52.135
taking this course. Talking about math can actually help you learn it better and

00:00:52.147 --> 00:00:55.455
the forum is a great place to do this. You can ask questions about things you

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:58.350
don't understand or even just about cool algebra related things. So that's

00:00:58.728 --> 00:01:02.029
probably pretty different from other math classes you've taken before. It's

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.541
theme based and it focuses on inquiry learning which means that we help you

00:01:05.553 --> 00:01:09.155
discover the mathematics on your own and show how it's relevant for your life.

00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:11.470
We hope you enjoy the course. Let's get started.
