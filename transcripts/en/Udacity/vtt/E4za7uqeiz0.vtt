00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.765
If you remember how to count the digits of a number you'll remember that you'll

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:08.799
need a temp so that we can count down the digits without messing up number. Now

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.398
we're going to repeatedly divide temp by ten to count the, now we're going to

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:17.997
repeatedly divide temp by ten to iterate through the digits from the last to

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:25.070
the first. So the way that we'll iterate through each digit in the number is to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.910
first use mod to get the last digit and then divide by 10 so that we discard

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.492
the last digit. Then when we use mod 10 again, we'll get the next last digit.

00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:43.560
So the first digit will be temp mod 10 and then we divide temp by 10 to discard

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.402
the last digit. Now in here we want to be counting all of the digits that match

00:00:51.402 --> 00:01:03.520
digit to match. So we'll need a counter. That starts out at 0. And then every

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.400
time we find a digit that matches digit to match the increment, the counter, I

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.810
think I might have some type errors in here, because I'm mixing int and long.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.903
But let's see. Alright. I know that when I mod something by 10, the biggest

00:01:14.903 --> 00:01:20.546
number I'll get is nine. So I know that's it's safe to actually cast this after

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:27.278
I take the mod and I will actually need to return the count. I wrote tester

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:30.956
here to make sure my program works right. In this number I expect there to be

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:35.882
four 9's, one 3's, and no fives. Since I fix all my syntax errors, I'll run my

00:01:35.882 --> 00:01:38.559
number tester, it looks good.
