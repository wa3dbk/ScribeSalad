00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.741
I want to make a point here that--it's a bit of a ninja topic,

00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:10.013
but it turns out that exploding every last bit of parallelism isn't always the very best performing code.

00:00:10.013 --> 00:00:12.780
Sometimes it helps to do more work per thread,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.190
and this leads to an advanced optimization technique called granularity coarsening that we'll talk about later.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.972
With that said, the first problem is almost always to find enough parallelism.

00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:25.513
So keeping that in mind, are we done?

00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:30.367
Is this 0.7 milliseconds the fastest that we can transpose this matrix on this GPU?

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:32.136
Let's reason that out.

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.751
So 2 things can limit your performance on any code:

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:38.089
Time spent fetching and storing data from and to memory,

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.592
or time spent performing compute operations on that data.

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:47.753
Now the transpose code has almost no computation at all; it's entirely about moving data around.

00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:52.222
So let's ignore compute for the moment and focus on memory.

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:57.814
My question is, are we moving that data around efficiently? How can we tell?

00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:02.410
There's a handy utility called Device Query that's included in the CUDA SDK.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.339
Let's run it.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.600
Device Query spits out an enormous amount of information,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.839
and most of which you really don't need to know right now,

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.276
but buried in here are a few things that I want to point out.

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:16.369
The GPU clock rate is how fast the actual processors in the GPU are going.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.457
The memory clock rate shows you how fast the memory in the GPU is operating.

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:24.088
And the memory bus width describes how many bits of memory

00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:27.603
are actually being transferred for each of these clock cycles.

00:01:27.603 --> 00:01:31.402
So from this we can actually figure out the maximum speed of the memory,

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:36.466
the maximum bandwidth, the maximum amount of data that we can transfer in a second.
