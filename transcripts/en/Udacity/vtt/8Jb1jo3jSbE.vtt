00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.890
Continuing the same talk,

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.830
let's not talk about the whole concept of how images are focused.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.370
Here as I have said, image is being formed at the focal plane of this lens.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.550
All light is hitting there.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.110
It's converging to a point.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.430
And I should get a nice crisp image here.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.670
What happens if I was to now try to move the image further backwards?

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.330
If I move it backwards, what should happen is multiple kind of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.250
copies should be available because none of the rays of light that

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.560
are coming through the lens would converge at that point.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.510
They mostly converge, in fact they always converge at the focal point, so

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.390
you should see a little bit of a blurry image,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.135
of course, I'm just simulating that here.

00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:41.700
Similarly, if I move the image plane in front of the focal plane,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.120
I should also get a blurry image.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.516
So focusing most of the time in a camera is done by moving the sensor, or

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:52.340
sometimes of course the lens, forward and backwards to make,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.257
basically make sure that the image is formed at the focal point.

00:00:56.257 --> 00:01:01.162
And the distance between the image and the sensor plane where the image is

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:06.230
formed is set to the focal length of the lens that's been given.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.380
So the focusing concept basically is where we move the lens in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.530
relationship with the imaging plane, which should be on the focus plane.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.660
By just moving those two things together, you can now make sure that

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.770
the image is formed exactly at the image plane, which is now at the focal plane.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.380
So image plane has to be at the focal plane to be able to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.590
generate a smooth crisp image.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.270
If it's after or before the focal plane you will see blurriness.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.990
So focusing is done by moving the sensor or the lens in

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.610
relationship to each other to be able to create a relationship where

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.360
the distance between the lens and the image plane

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.400
is exactly aligned to where the focus plane for that lens would be.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.500
In doing so, we guarantee that the image is going to be crisp and

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.770
focused on the image plane.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.590
If it's in front, that is the sensor or the image plane is in front of

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.570
the focal plane, or after it, it's behind it, you'll get a blurry image.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.980
Let's look at another example of this.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.530
Here I'm just showing you three images.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.520
Again, for this image here, if all the light is going through my lens, and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.340
of course it's forming on the image plane or the sensor here.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.933
Of course, by changing this relationship, if I get this closer,

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:31.118
if the object is farther away from it, you will get to see the smaller object.

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:35.662
But in essence, what I was talking about with focusing is here, this is

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:41.040
the best focus point here and basically how the lens moves with respect to this,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.841
is essential to be able to get a crisp image or

00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:46.229
a blurry images as are noticed here.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.440
We looked at this whole concept a little bit for pinhole cameras.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.790
Again, in that size of course, the size of the pinhole was the reason for

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.090
creating blurry images or not.
