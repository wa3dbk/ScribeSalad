00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.230
Let's code this in Java. I can see here

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.530
that I have the number of students and the

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.800
number of topics and the two-dimensional array of grades.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.530
I can ignore the student names and the topics for

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.390
now. What I'm really interested in is implementing the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.690
total for student method. To do this, the important thing

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.790
to recognize is that I want to access all of

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.330
the grades in one row. The grades in one row

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.030
all share their first index, but their second index

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.380
varies because that tells which column. So I'll loop

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.410
over all of the columns starting at the first

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.200
one and since there's a column for each topic, I'll

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.180
keep going as long as my column is less

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.700
than the number of topics. I'll need a variable to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.480
hold the sum. And for each item, I'll add

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.030
the grade in the studentIndex row in the column column.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.450
And when I'm done, I'll return the sum. Just

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.650
to be safe, if somebody gives me a bad studentIndex.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.850
I want to return minus one. So if studentIndex is less

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.290
than zero or greater than or equal to the number

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.750
of students, I return minus one. This is always a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.340
good idea when somebody else is calling your method. You

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.430
want to think about the things that they could do wrong,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.220
and agree on a good way to handle those cases.
