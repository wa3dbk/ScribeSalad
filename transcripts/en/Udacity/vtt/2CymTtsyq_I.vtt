Here are a bunch of lines that I've drawn on one coordinate plane. You'll notice

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.725
that I've labeled each of these lines with a name. We have v, w, x, y, and z.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.039
And I'd like you to pick which of these categories each of these lines falls

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.523
into. For some of these lines, there may be more than one category.
