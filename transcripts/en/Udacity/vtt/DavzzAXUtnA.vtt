00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.973
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here's one that I'd like you to do on your own. We have the equation 3x

00:00:03.973 --> 00:00:08.404
squared plus 7x minus 10 equals 2x squared plus 5x plus 5. And I'd like you to

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:13.015
solve for x. Now I know this probably looks really complicated right now because

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:17.308
there are a lot of terms on both sides of the equation. But for your first few

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:21.395
steps just start out by trying to get it in the general form for a quadratic

00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:25.419
equation. So with all the terms on one side and with like terms combined, and

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.820
then just 0 on the other side of the equation.
