00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.855
This equation represents a hyperbola that opens to the left and to the right. I

00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:09.425
hope you've got the hang of this. We'll start by moving 2 y squared to the left

00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:13.940
hand side. So we need to subtract 2 y squared here and subtract 2 y squared

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.128
here. This leaves us with this equation. We have subtraction between our x

00:00:19.128 --> 00:00:22.656
squared term an our y squared term, so we definitely know that the conic, is a

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:27.705
hyperbola. Now to determine which direction it opens, we look at which term is

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:33.270
positive. Well the x squared term is positive. So that's why we know our

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.470
hyperbola opens left, an it opens to the right.
