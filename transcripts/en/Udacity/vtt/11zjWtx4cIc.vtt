00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.240
So, we just looked at two examples of Web sites who

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.180
use their own internal APIs to resolve new data for their users.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.230
This is really cool, but unless you're already working for

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.200
a giant web app, you probably don't have a massive internal database of

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.250
cool information you can query asynchronously.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.996
But luckily, there are tons of APIs available on the Web that readily serve up

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:23.758
interesting information.

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:25.275
And they're usually free to use so

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.310
long as you aren't making thousands of requests per hour.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.770
For instance, Google offers a ton of APIs,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.120
including Google Analytics, Google Maps, Google Fonts.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.180
Looking around the Web, it isn't hard to find examples of Web sites that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.990
use external APIs to create interesting interactions for users.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.720
Reddit and the Reddit Enhancement Suite Chrome plugin interact with

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.150
a few different APIs to make Reddit feel more dynamic.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.880
When a user clicks on a link that resolves to a YouTube video,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.540
Reddit opens up an embedded YouTube player which interacts with the YouTube API.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.840
Or when a user opens up a link to a Twitter feed,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.230
the Reddit Enhancement Suite Chrome plugin fires off an AJAX request for Twitter

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.640
data, and uses the Twitter API to open up the tweet right here inside the page.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.400
Check out the link in the instructor notes if you want to find some more APIs

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.230
that are available.
