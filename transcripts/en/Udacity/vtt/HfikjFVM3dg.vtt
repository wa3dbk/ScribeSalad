00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.200
I think in part because clustering tends not to have one

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.780
consistent definition it's very algorithm

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.370
driven. So there's different algorithms for

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.000
doing clustering and we can analyze each of those algorithms somewhat

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.950
independently. There isn't really one problem and then there's a bunch

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.480
of different algorithms for attacking that one problem. Each algorithm kind

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.010
of has its own problem. So, I think the, the easiest

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.570
way to go through and talk about unsupervised learning and clustering

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.540
is to start going through some algorithms. So I'm going to start with

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.390
single linkage clustering, because I think it's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.990
in many ways the simplest and most natural.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.370
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.110
&gt;&gt; And it has some very nice properties. So it's,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.740
it's, it's not a terrible idea, it's been very useful in

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.120
statistics in a very long time. So, so here's how

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.610
single linkage clustering goes, let's imagine we've got these objects. That

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.350
we'll call them these little, these little red dots. We're

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.060
imagine that they're objects and just because it would be hard

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.530
to write down all the D values between them. Let's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.240
just literally use the 2 dimensional space, the distance on the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.190
slide here as the distances. Okay.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.750
&gt;&gt; So, you can, so if you were, if you were asked to cluster this

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.970
how would you do it? Like, what do you think the, the groupings ought to be?

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.319
&gt;&gt; Well, just staring at them they're either two or they're four.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.180
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.110
&gt;&gt; Or maybe, there's five. So, I would

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.910
probably put the three on the left that

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.510
there together, together. And I would put the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.510
four on the right that are together, together.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.380
Or I might notice that the two at the top of the ones on the right

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.870
are more together than the other two and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.000
sub divide them some more. But, if I were

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.160
just far enough away, I would definitely say

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.780
so that seems like a reasonable clustering, but

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.100
also the one that took all four of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.830
those and put them together is a reasonable clustering.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.610
&gt;&gt; Right. Yeah, yeah. That means that sort

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.450
of agrees with what my eyes are thinking as

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.430
well. Alright, so so it'd be good if we

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.630
can recover that kind of structure algorithmically, so let's let's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.970
talk through this, this algorithm. It's

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.460
called single linkage clustering, sometimes SLC.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.130
&gt;&gt; Or "slick". nice. It's a, it's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.700
a hierarchical agglomorative cluster of algorithm, or HAC.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.430
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like that acronym even better.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.590
&gt;&gt; That's an Andrew Moore joke, for what it's worth.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.090
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's a slick HAC.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.120
&gt;&gt; Nice. All right. So here's what we're going to

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.850
do. We're going to consider each object a cluster to start.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.530
We're going to do this interatively. So we start off

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.710
with N objects, like we have here. One, two,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010
three, four, five, six, seven. And we're going to define

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.670
the inter cluster distance as the distance between the closest

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.090
two points in the two clusters. So in the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.140
beginning, all the points are in their own clusters.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.890
All the objects are in their own clusters. So

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.940
the inter. Cluster distance is exactly the interobject distance. Okay?

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.140
&gt;&gt; But, little by little, we're going to actually

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.250
be aggregating things into larger clusters and we have to define what

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.020
it means for how, how close is one cluster to another. And

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.380
we'll say the close, the closest between two clusters is the closest

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.310
of the closest two points between those two clusters. All right. So, so

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.900
now what we're going to do is we're going to iterate. We're

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.360
going to say merge the two closest clusters, because, you know, they belong

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.630
together. And then we're just going to repeat that n minus k

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.270
times To leave us with K clusters. So K is now an input

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.980
to this algorithm.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.630
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.880
&gt;&gt; All right. So help me out. Let's step through

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.040
this. What what would we merge first according to this algorithm?

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.480
&gt;&gt; Well, they're either on cluster I, according to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.300
my eyesight, which is, of course, perfect. I would take

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.570
the two left most ones, upper left most ones.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.830
Probably and merge them together. They look closest to me.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.940
&gt;&gt; Alright let me label them just to make your life a little bit easier.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.710
&gt;&gt; Oh that'd be nice.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.500
&gt;&gt; Alright. SO what do you think?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.460
&gt;&gt; I would bring

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.190
A and B togheter.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.380
&gt;&gt; ALright. They're now a cluster. So we had seven clusters now we

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.470
have six. Oh by the way we're trying to get down to two.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.050
&gt;&gt; Okay and then I would put C and D together.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.580
&gt;&gt; Then I would probably want to put c,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.420
d, and e together, because they're in alphabetical order.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.190
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]. All right, well, just to be concrete about this, why, what is

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.250
the next step that we're supposed to do? What we're supposed to do is

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.750
say which pair of clusters is closest. And again,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.390
the, the, distance between, say, I don't know, the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.890
a b cluster and the c d cluster is not the average over all the points or the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.070
furthest points but the closest ones. So, like I

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.440
think c and d, the,the distance between the a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.070
b cluster and the c d cluster is exactly

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.780
the distance between b and d in this case.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.895
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:11.895 --> 00:04:12.520
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.980
&gt;&gt; Alright. So we know what's the currently closest pair of clusters.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.260
&gt;&gt; from, from where I am looking, it's either e to the c and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
d or g to a and b and they look very similar to me.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.830
&gt;&gt; E to C and D or G to B and A, that's what you said?

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Probably G to B and A, staring at.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.250
&gt;&gt; I tried really hard to make it so that they're be

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.640
an easy answer, but you're right, I, they're really close. So let's,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.800
let's I think it doesn't matter too much. we'll, we'll say that

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.450
that one's neck. So now we'll say, now we'll do a quick quiz.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.200
&gt;&gt; Okay. So what merge

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.640
does, single link clustering do next? Just give

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.250
the pair of points I would be connecting.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.200
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.310
&gt;&gt; Say, separated by a comma.
