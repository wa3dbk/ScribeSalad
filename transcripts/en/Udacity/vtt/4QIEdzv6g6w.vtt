00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.509
So let's start again by looking at where ten and 16 fall in the distribution.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.019
Ten is three points less than the mean, and 16 is three points greater than the

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.295
mean. So, if this is the mean, 13, this is ten, and here is 16. We're looking

00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:21.959
for the area in between those two. How might we figure this out? Well, what

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:28.199
we'll do is, we'll find the area under 16, and then we'll subtract the area less

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.815
than ten. So what's the area less than 16? First, let's convert 16 to a z-score,

00:00:34.815 --> 00:00:41.137
16 minus 13 divided by 4.8. So this is 0.625. Since ten is equidistant from 13

00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:46.710
as 16 is, then the z-score for 10 is going to be negative 0.625. You can go

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.580
ahead and calculate that if you want. Sometimes that helps things make more

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.367
sense. So let's find the area less than a z-score of 0.625. We'll find 0.6 in

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:03.823
the vertical column and we'll have to round to the hundredths place, since

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:09.415
that's as detailed as the z-table gets. So we'll round to 0.63, so that's this

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:15.920
column and we should get 0.7357. And then, we'll subtract the area less than

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.274
ten, which has a z-score of negative 0.625. So here is negative 0.6 and here is

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:30.782
the column for 0.03, so the area less than negative 0.63 is 0.2643. Notice that

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:37.737
since these are the same values, just one is positive and one is negative, then

00:01:37.737 --> 00:01:44.796
the area less than 0.625 plus the are less than 0.625 adds to one. So basically,

00:01:44.796 --> 00:01:52.211
this area here, plus this area here equals one. That's because the area here is

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:59.121
equal to the area here. So, if you add 0.7357 and 0.2643, you should get one. So

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:06.344
that's just a property of the symmetry of the normal distribution. So if we

00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:13.354
subtract them, we get 0.4714, and that's the area here in between 10 and 16.
