00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.900
R is the leading programming language for statistics and data analysis.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.120
One of the main advantages of using R is that we

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.550
can build up an analysis line by line in code. We

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.560
can save all of our work in a file and go

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.740
back to see what we investigated at a later date. Having

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.830
R scripts allows you to easily share your work with others.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.950
And you can see what others are doing with data. R

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.220
also has over 2,000 user contributed packages that increase its functionality.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.070
One example of this is the text analysis package, TextCat, that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.830
you just saw. Now, one of the main packages we'll use

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.880
throughout this course is ggplot2. Ggplot2 is a graphics package that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.550
let's us create plots And graphs with just a few commands.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.770
We'll learn more about ggplot in the next lesson but just

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.000
to give you a taste of it, here's an example of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110
a plot you can create. Now, don't worry about memorizing or

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.350
understanding all of this code. You'll have plenty of practice with

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.780
this later in the course. I just want to show you

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.110
how a few lines of code, can create amazing graphics.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.280
I'm going to load up the ggplot library and a color

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.360
library. Then I'm going to load the diamonds data set, and with

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.310
this function I'll create a scatter plot. Let's check out

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.540
this plot in detail. This part shows the relationship between price

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.430
and carat of almost 54,000 round cut diamonds. I'd say

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.550
R is doing very well for such few lines of code.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.180
The last thing I want to mention is that you

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
can use R anywhere. It's free open source software that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.240
works on any operating system. And as a result of

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.620
this, R has a large active and growing community of users.
