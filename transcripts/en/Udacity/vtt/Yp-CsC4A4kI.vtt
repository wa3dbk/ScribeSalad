Hey Andrea.
We created illustrations of those acorns

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.550
and family photos that you provided us,
and

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.150
we added them as images into the app.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.689
Here, take a look.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.060
&gt;&gt; This is so cool.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.280
Look at these family member icons.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.580
This one looks just like my grandmother.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.160
And the colors, and the acorns.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.170
This is starting to really feel great.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything's coming
together really well.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.640
&gt;&gt; But I think there's one
more feature we can add.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.490
&gt;&gt; What's that?

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.400
Well, the ability to hear the correct
pronunciation of each word.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.260
&gt;&gt; Pronunciation is really
important in learning a language.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.650
It's been the hardest thing for me.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.200
&gt;&gt; That's true, and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.760
in order to do that we need an audio
file of each word being spoken.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.420
Andrea, could you records
some audio files for us?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.370
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.040
I'll have to brush up
on my pronunciation.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.870
&gt;&gt; Don't worry.
You're going to do great.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.070
Let's go into the recording studio
to make those sound clips, then.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.830
&gt;&gt; So while they're doing that,
let's get back to the course map.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.380
All right, so right now we're at lesson
four out of our four lesson course.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.110
We're in the homestretch now.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.180
Now in this lesson, we're going to first
allow the user to play an audio file to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.425
hear the pronunciation of
each word when they touch it.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:02.365
Next we're going to learn about
Android's activity lifecycle and

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.655
also learn how to properly clean up
resources in the right callbacks.

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:08.915
Now, here's a diagram of the activity
life cycle that we'll be discussing more

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:09.935
in detail later.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:10.455
Now, onward.
