00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.680
After you unzip the downloaded file, you can open it up and

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.630
see the file structure within it.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.373
Notice how there are two versions of everything with the same name.

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:11.416
We have bootstrap-theme.css and

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:16.450
bootstrap-theme.min.css and the same goes for JavaScript.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.710
When a user opens your Web page or rather, when their browsers open the Web

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.630
page, they'll have to download all of the style and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.070
JavaScript files that you've included in it.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.370
Sometimes these files can be quite large.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.369
So to help avoid that problem, we use minified files.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.580
Minified CSS and

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.660
JavaScript files take up less space and can be downloaded faster.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.710
On the left side,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.310
I've got the unminified, the normal version of bootstrap.css file open.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.100
Notice how it looks pretty normal, but on the right,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.400
I've got the minified version of the same file.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.010
These two files are the same, but all of the white space has been taken out of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.030
the minified version, while on the unminified version, it is still readable.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.450
You should always include the minified version of your files on your site so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.070
they can be downloaded faster.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.677
But when you're editing, you should definitely use the unminified version.

00:01:04.677 --> 00:01:07.580
Otherwise, you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what's going on.
