So as I said moods are longer lasting affective experiences and usually are not

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:09.431
in response to very specific situations. Moods can last minutes or hours and

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:13.457
occasionally even longer and as for the cause of moods, as compared to emotion,

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:18.591
the cause is vague and not clear. We often just find ourselves in a good mood

00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:21.330
or in a bad mood and we don't really know why.
