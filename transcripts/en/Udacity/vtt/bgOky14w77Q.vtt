00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.270
OK, so we just looked at a way of

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.660
modifying a document using the save method. Now let's

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.040
look at an alternative way of updating documents. What

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.870
I want to introduce you to here, are two things.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.520
One, the update command or method in pymongo it's

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.020
a method on collection objects. And the set operator. Let's

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.170
talk about update first. Update expects a query document

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.480
as its first parameter, and then as its second parameter,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.760
it expects an update document. And that

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.590
update document specifies what operations MongoDB should perform

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.560
on the document matching this query. Now,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.270
by default, update operates on just one document.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.430
The first one it finds matching the query document. The semantics of set are, if

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270
this document does not already contain the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.260
fields specified here, then what should happen is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.430
that field should be added with this value.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.530
If the document already contains this field, then that

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.440
field will be updated to the value supplied.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.120
Okay, now before I run this code, what I'd

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.239
like to do is introduce you to the

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.250
inverse operator for set, which is unset. Okay, so

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.620
these two pieces of code are almost exactly

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.630
the same. The only differences are here and here.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.500
The semantics of unset are, for whatever document matches

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580
this query, if it has the field specified here,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.160
remove it. This value is ignored. Now, if this

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.480
document does not already have this field, then this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.834
call has no effect. Okay, so now we've looked

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.154
at the set operator and the unset operator, and

00:01:35.154 --> 00:01:38.850
their use with the update command. Now, let's go

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.740
and run these two programs. And see what their

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.390
effect is. But first, I want to query for this

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.140
document in the Mongo shell to look at its current state,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.660
and then we can see how running those two programs changes

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.270
its current state. So I'm going to run a find one command

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.260
here. Now, this is exactly the same command as we

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.960
saw in the Python programs we were looking at. The only

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.120
difference is in the name. And the names are different merely

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.630
to match the conventions of the two different programming languages represented.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.300
In this case, JavaScript because the language of the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.110
Mongo Shell is JavaScript. And, in the other case,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.580
Python, because we're using the Pymongo driver. Okay? So,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.390
going to issue this query. And, I want to point out

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.820
that the Iso Code is in fact present. Now

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.830
let's run the unset example and then go back

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.210
to the Mongo shell and issue our query again.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.020
Okay? And note that the iso country code has

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.710
disappeared because we just ran this command. Okay,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.270
now let's run our set example. And again remember

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.910
this simply uses the set operator. Let's do

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.140
our query again in the Mongo shell and note

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.890
that the iso country code is now in

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.220
our document again. Okay, so now we've looked at

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.570
two different commands that allow us to modify documents.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.370
The save command, and the update command. And we've

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.020
looked at two different operators being used in conjunction

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.049
with the update command. Okay, now I feel like it's

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.010
necessary before we move on to just give you a

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.830
heads up. It's really easy to forget to put an

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.140
operator here. Okay? If you issue your command this

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.900
way, what's going to happen is this entire document, the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.100
document matching this query, will be replaced so that it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.310
contains the underscore ID field and this field only. So,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.290
essentially, the document will be composed entirely of a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.570
single field. So, always take care to use update correctly.
