00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.830
Let's try that same example
function now in Python code.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.180
So up here we have our normal imports,
here is where we define the function

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.910
and again we're simply
using X-1.5 squared +0.5.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.720
Now within this function
we're going to go ahead and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.910
print what the value
is when we get called.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.500
It just is a little bit handier so that
we can see what exactly is going on.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.070
But you don't have to
have that of course.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.120
And then we return y.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.420
Now this is going to be the function
that we're going to Ask SciPy,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.740
or in particular the optimizer,
to minimize for us.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.960
And by the way, we've included
this optimize package as spo.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.510
So scipy.optimize as spo.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.040
This is our call now to the optimizer or
the minimizer.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.515
Before we call it we first set
our guess value to be 2.0.

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:12.542
And we're using the function minimize so
we call spo.minimize.

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:16.455
F, that's our function here,
so we're saying minimizer,

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:19.850
please minimize find the minimum for
this function.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.670
X guess is our guess.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.570
Method is, we're directing minimize to
use a particular minimizing algorithm.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.310
We'll talk a little bit about
that a little bit later.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.200
But this is one of those particular
algorithms that happens to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.010
work pretty nicely.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.020
We send it one more option here,
disp, which is True.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.850
Which means we just want it to be
verbose about things that it discovers.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.250
Anyways, that's it.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.150
That calls the minimizer.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.820
The minimizer repeatedly
calls our function and

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.430
finds the minimum value,
then it prints out those results.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.440
Let's try a test run and
see what happens.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.900
Remember, in our function
that we wanted to minimize,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.950
we explicitly printed X and Y.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.580
So here you can see each time it gets
called it prints these values out.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.160
And so the minimizer is repeatedly
calling that function f and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.150
it's printing these things out.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.460
So it gets called initially
with an X of 2 and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.515
it discovers that the value is 0.75.

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:35.610
Then a value slightly greater than 2,
a value slightly less than 2.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.820
And the minimizer very quickly converges
on 1.5 as the answer, and here

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.110
it prints out those values and finds the
minima at 1.5 with a value of 0.5 there.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.830
So pretty efficient and
effective discovery of the minimization.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.259
I added a few more lines of
code here which I'll highlight,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.000
merely to plot the answer, so
all the rest of the code is the same.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.310
But let's take a look now
if we plot it as well.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.200
So, same result as before but nice plot
with our minima identified right here.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.840
So, that is how to code up a minimizer,
it's really very easy and very powerful.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.310
Let's look at it a little bit further.
