00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.461
To find the x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of this rational function, we

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:08.029
need to set the numerator equal to 0. Since if that equals 0, then the whole

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.990
fraction equals 0, which means that f of x equals 0. And that's exactly what's

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.614
happening at an x-intercept. When we solve for x, we get x equals plus or minus

00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:23.696
1 over the square root of 8, or 1 over 2 root 2. This is approximately equal to

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:28.934
plus or minus 0.354 point. Now for our y-intercepts, all we need to do is plug

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:36.479
in zero for x. This gives us a y value of 1 9th. So, there we go. We have two

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.003
x-intercepts and one y-intercept.
