00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.170
In this first part of the git demo, we will

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.080
call it the basics of git. So for example, how to

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.280
introduce yourself to git, how to create a repository, how to

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.450
commit changes and get changes from the repository, and so on.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.140
So after you installed git you should have the git tool

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.150
available on the command line, so you can run the command

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.110
git and, if you just execute git you will get the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.930
usage information for git, with the most commonly used git commands.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.940
And to find information on any command, you can simply

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.310
type git help and the name of the command. For

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.240
example, let's try to write git help init. And that

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.960
brings up the git manual page for git init, which describes

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.590
the command, the synopsis, and so on. Now, let's get

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.970
started with using git by introducing ourselves to git, which is

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.830
the first thing we need to do. To do that

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.310
we use the git config command, in particular we are going to

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.170
write to the git config minus, minus global

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.440
user dot name. Which means we are telling it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.900
our user name. We'll specify our user name which

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.970
in this case is George P. Burdell. You could

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.970
also provide your email address in the same

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.370
way. So you still use the git config --global

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.750
command. But in this case you will write user.email

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.580
as the property. And then you'll specify a suitable

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.670
email address. In this case, the email address of George P.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.780
Burdell. We will now look at some commonly used commands that to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.210
create and maintain a local repository. Let's first create a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.510
new project and call it my project. So, to do that we

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.790
are simply going to create a directory and then we're going

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.520
to move into that directory. Now, if we try to call the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.000
git status command at this point to see what's the state of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.990
my project, of course git doesn't know anything about this project, right?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.360
So, you will get an error. It will tell you that, basically,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.080
we're not in a git repository. So how do we create a git

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.090
repository? How do we make this? A Git repository, but we do it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.560
by calling git init and the output will tell you that the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.580
repository was initialized. If we check the status again, you will see

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.790
that now Git recognizes the repository and will tell you that there is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.160
nothing to commit because, of course,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.190
the repository is completely empty. So let's

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.380
just create a new, empty file. Which we're going to call REAME. So

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.008
now if you run git status, as you can see, git will

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.250
tell you there is a file that's called README, but it's untracked.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.600
Now what that means is that the file not staged, if you

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.710
remember our lesson. So what we need to do, we first need

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.040
to tell git that, you know, this needs to be considered. And

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.690
the way we do that, is by calling the git at command

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.880
and then we specify README as the argument for the command. If

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.090
we call again, Git status. Now, as you can see, Git knows

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.780
that there is a new file called README, because the file

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.390
is staged. So Git is aware of the fact that this

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.490
file has to be committed. So, to commit a file,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.410
we simply execute git commit, which will open a text editor, which

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.500
can be different, depending on what is your environment, and here

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.980
we need to add a comment to be added to the commit.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.760
So here we simply write in Added README file, then we

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.170
can close and save And this will add the file to the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.310
Git repository. The local Git repository of course. At this

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.220
point, if we ran Git status again to see where we are.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.400
You can see that Git tells you that there is nothing

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.660
to commit. Because of course the only file that we have, is

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.070
committed to the repository. Now, let's make some changes to our

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.270
README file. I'm just going to add some text here. Once more, we

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.050
can run git status, and at this point, git knows about

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.430
this file. So, it will know that README file has been modified.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.280
Remember that before, it was telling you that it was a new

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.310
file, now it knows that there was a different version in the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.430
repository. So something we can do, at this point, for example, is

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.820
to check the differences. Between this file and the committed one by

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.040
executing get diff readme and if you look at the output of

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.320
the get diff command here, you can see that this line, readme

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.170
file content was added and you'll see that it was added because

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.610
there's a plus sign before that line. In case of deletion of lines,

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.460
you'll see a minusm sign there. So at this point, if we

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.950
want to commit our file, remember that we'll always have to tell git

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.070
that we want to stage the file before committing it. Otherwise, it

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.420
will be ignored by the commit operation. So to tell git, that the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.140
file has to be staged, we will, can use the usual git

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.140
add command. But if you remember the lesson, we can also use a

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.150
shortcut. So you, we don't really have to do this in two steps.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.730
We can simply say, git commit -a, and this will tell git to

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.120
commit all of the files that git knows about, which in this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.959
case is only the written file of course. Something else that we can

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.950
do, is that we can also provide the right away message for

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.140
the commit, without having to open an editor. So, to do that we

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.760
can specify the -n option. And at this point a we can

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.050
just put a in double quotes our content we press enter and as

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.690
you can see it will notify us that one file was changed

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.850
and in particular it will also tell you that there was an a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.470
insertion again if we run git status you will see that

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.800
there is nothing else to commit. So now let's imagine that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.390
you want to see the version history for your repository. You

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.760
can do that by running the git log command. So if

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.560
you run that, it will show you all the different commits

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.990
For your repository. And each commit has got a commit ID, as

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.010
you can see here and the one down here is

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.740
the first commit, where as the one above is the second commit.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.670
And as you can see, we'll also show you the comments associated

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.070
with each commit. And in case you wanted to see the changes introduced

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.500
by a commit. You can use that git show command, and you

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.220
can provide the commit ID for the commit that you're interested in.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.600
And you don't really need to provide the whole ID, you can

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.600
provide the first four or more characters. So that's what we're going to

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.540
do here. So we're going to specify the second commit, and when we

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.120
execute the command it will show use the changes introduced by that commit.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.550
To fetch a repository from a remote server, you can

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.350
use the git clone command. So you will write git clone

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.140
and then specify the URL. For the remote repository. Here

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.260
we are using the SSH protocal and there are different protocals

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.680
that can be used, so the remote repository can be

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.800
made available in different ways. As you can see, when you

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.050
clone the project, the project is cloned into the local directory.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.180
If you wanted to import the project under a different name.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.790
You could just specify the name that you want for the

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.110
Local Directory. For example, in this case, myproject2. And,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.630
so here you'll get the project in my local work space

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.530
with the name that I specified. So, let's go inside one

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.020
of these two projects that have the same content because they're

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.930
coming from the repository. If you want to see the details

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.550
of the server you can use the remote command and specify

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.230
the flag -v. And here we'll show you what is the remote

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.560
repository now let's go ahead to make some changes to the project

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.820
for example let's add a file. So I'm just going to create this

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.230
empty file which I am going to call new file I'm going to

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.890
add it to my index so that it gets committed. Later on and

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.650
then I'm going to run git commit to actually commit it to the

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.570
local repository. And I'm going to specify the comment for the commit right

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.120
away here from the command line. So when we do that the

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.680
file gets added to my local repository. And if we want to double

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.690
check that, we can run git log. And if you look at

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.360
the last commit at the top, you can see that it's telling

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.980
me that the new file was added to the repository, showing the

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.940
comment that I added. But this is just for the local repository,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.100
so I need to use the git push command to push it

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.250
to the remote repository. And at this point, when I run that,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.890
my local changes will be committed. To the remote repository. So now

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.110
let's go to the other copy of the project that we created.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.660
The one under directory myproject2. If you remember this project was

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.610
linked up to the same remote project. But of course, if we run

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.720
get log here, we don't see this latest change that we made, because

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.970
we didn't synchronize this local copy with the remote copy. And so we

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.530
just have these files, the README and ,Five that worked there before.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.720
So what we need to do is that we need to pull the

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.180
changes from the remote repository using git pull, and when we do that,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.130
that will actually pull these changes and therefore, create the new files that

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.340
we created in the other directory. And if we run git log now,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.790
you can see that now we have the new entry. The comment at

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.920
the top, that says this new file was added and of course, this

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.880
is just an example, so we had two copies of the project on the

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.990
same machine and for the same user, so the normal users scenario for

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.230
this, it will be that, each user will have their local copy, but this

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.220
should have given you the idea of how, git allows you to work

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.210
on some local file. Commit them and push them to a remote repository and

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.680
other users to get your changes, do further changes push

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.860
them as well and then, you know, they will allow you

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.890
to get their changes, and so on and so forth. So

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.540
really allows this collaboration between different users and keeping track

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.730
of all the changes made by the different users. So now

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.860
let's look at some more advanced concept, which are the concept

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.600
of branching, and merging. So what branching means is basically is

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.540
to make a copy, to create a branch of the current

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.070
project so that we can work on that copy indpendently from the

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.740
other copy, from the other branch. And then we can decide whether

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.190
we want to keep, both branches, or we want to merge them at

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.510
some point. And you can of course have multiple branches, not just two.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.558
And the reason why this is particularly useful is because in many

00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:46.790
cases if you think, about the way we develop software in general,

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.030
we work with artifacts. We might have the need to create kind

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.910
of a separate copy of your work space. To do some experiments for example.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:54.940
So you want to change something in

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.250
the code, you're not really sure it's going to

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.650
work and you don't want to touch

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.500
your main copy. So that's the perfect application

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.830
for branching. If you want to do

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.710
something like that...you want to experiment or do

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.800
some modifications that you're not sure about,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.820
you will branch your code, you will do

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.230
the changes...and then if you're happy with

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.890
the changes, you will merge that branch

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.250
with the original one, or worse if you're not happy with the changes you will

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.680
just throw away that branch. So this is just one possible use of branch but

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.950
it's one of the main uses of that. So in all let's see how that

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.070
can be done with git. So first of all if you

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.740
want to see which branches are currently present in your project, you can

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.260
simply execute git branch, and in this case, you can see

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.090
that there's only one branch, which is called master, and the star

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.940
there indicates that this is our current branch. So how do

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.210
we create a new branch? So we simply run the command

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.010
git branch and specify a name for the new branch, for example we'll

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.110
call it newBranch, to make it very explicit. At this point,

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.940
if we run git branch of course, we will have

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.410
a new branch plus master will still be our current branch. So

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.780
if you want to switch to the new branch, we will use

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.510
the git checkout command and specify the name of the branch that

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.220
we want to become our current branch. So when we run that,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.780
git will tell us that we switched to the new branch. And

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.920
if we run git branch you will see that now the star

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.130
is next to newBranch because that's our current branch. There is a

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.834
shortcut for these two commands. If you run the command git

00:10:12.834 --> 00:10:17.240
checkout specify the -b flag and then the name of

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.790
the new branch it will do both things at the same

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.910
time. It will create the new branch called testing in this

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.760
case, and then it will switch to new branch and then

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.860
it will tell you after executing the command. So now if

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.290
we look at the git branch output, you can see that

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.090
there is three branches and we are currently on the testing branch.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.300
So now let's create a new file and just call it test

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.180
file, put some content in there, save it, we edit and commit it.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.280
And as you can see, now in this current branch, we have our

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.430
testFile. So now let's switch to a different branch. So let's go back

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.550
to the master branch using the usual git checkout command. So now if

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.310
we do an ls, if we check the content of the current directory,

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.140
we can see that the testFile is not there, because of course, it's

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.070
not in this branch. so now let's assume that we are happy with

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.260
the testFile that we created, with the modification that we made on the

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.080
branch. And so we want to merge that branch with our master branch.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.180
To do that we can call the git merge command and

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.260
we'll specify the branch that we want to merge with the current

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.030
one. So we will specify testing in this case. That will merge

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.260
the testing branch with the current branch, which is the master. Which

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.200
means that now the testfile is in my current working directory,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.180
is in my current, Current branch. And if I run the branch,

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.590
you'll see that the testing branch is obviously still there, so let's

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.370
assume that we want to delete the testing branch at this point

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.220
because we don't need it anymore. We could simply execute

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.940
the branch -d which stands for -delete, specify

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.670
the name of the branch and this will eliminate that

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.670
branch as confirmed by running the command git branch or the

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.030
testing branch no longer shows up. So, something that might

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.200
happen when you merge a branch is, is that you

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.000
might have conflicts For example, in case you change the,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.600
the same file into different branches. So, let's see an example

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.730
of that. So, we're going to check which branches we have,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.260
so we have two branches, in this case, master and newBranch

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.040
Our current branch is master. Let's open this file called new

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.310
file and, add some content there. So now let's commit

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.890
this changes to the get to the local repository. Now

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.600
let's switch to the other branch and if you remember we

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.900
do this by running git checkout and the name of the

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.150
branch. And at this point we do the same operation here.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.090
So we take this file and we change it here to. In this

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.740
case we have content that reflects the fact that we are. In the

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.790
new branch just for convenience. At this point, we also can move the

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.870
file here. The comment here is, of course, that this is the new

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.800
file in the new branch. So, at this point, what we have here

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.980
is that we have this file called newfile that has been modified

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.320
independently both in the master branch and in the new branch. So we

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.090
have a conflict. Right? So, now, let's switch back to the master branch.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.720
So now, let's say we want to merge the two branches. So

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.490
since we are in master, we want to say that when I

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.970
merge the new branch into the current one. And when we run

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.540
that, we get an auto merging conflict. So at this point what

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.390
we can do, is that we can manually fix the conflict by

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.910
opening the new file. So the file that was showing the conflict.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.860
So here you can see the kind of of information that you get

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.340
in the conflicted file. So it's telling you basically that there is

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.760
in the head which is the, the master this conflict. Which is new

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.830
file in master. Which is the content that we added of course. And

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.190
then you know, under, you know, the separator you can see the content

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.650
that was added in the new branch. Which is the contents in new

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.990
file, in new branch. So basically, what this is showing you is the

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.150
parts of the file that are conflicting. In this case, we only have

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.990
one line, is basically the whole file into two versions and you can

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.460
decide which version you want to keep or how you want to merge in

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.260
general, the two pieces. So here, let's assume that we

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.140
want to keep the content from the master. So what we're

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.510
going to do is we're going to elimate the annotations

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.500
and we're going to eliminate the additional content. We save this

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.680
file. So at this point what we need to do

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.040
is simply to commit the modified file (the merge file) and we

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.440
do that in the normal way. We call git add, specifying

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.180
the file, so git add newfile. Then we run git commit

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.630
newfile, and we specify in the comment for clarity that this is the merged file,

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.530
so that we performed a merge. And at this point we are done with our merge.
