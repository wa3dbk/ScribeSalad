00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.650
Let's look at the solution for
our Direct-Mapped Cache map access Quiz.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.110
We have these four axises in this cache.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.650
The cache block is 32 bytes.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.831
And there are eight blocks in the cache.

00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:18.356
So the address break down will
be the offset bits will be 5.

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:21.406
Because we need five bits to
tell us which of the 32 bytes we

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:22.980
are talking about.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.870
The index bits will be three,
because we need

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.340
three bits to tell us which of
the eight slots in the cache to use.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.440
And the remaining bits
are going to be the tag.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.170
Now let's consider which of
these map where in the cache.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.150
As you can see, the least significant
eight bits are going to determine

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.100
where in the cache something goes.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.560
So we can conveniently look at just
the least significant two hex digits.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.350
1F 0001 1111.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.760
Five bits are the offset,
and 000 is the index.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.510
So this goes here.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.974
3F2F has 0010 here and

00:01:07.974 --> 00:01:12.890
then 11111 but it goes to index 1.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.960
3F2E has two and then E,
it also maps here.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.210
Because it is actually
the same block as this one.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.050
They will both be in this slot here
because really the entire block

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.084
3F2 something is there.

00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:36.327
And finally 3E1F is
going to map to 001 F,

00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:41.166
so the index is zero,
and it's a different

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:45.480
block from the one we had previously.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.960
So this one will be replaced by this.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.169
The final content of the cache
really is that the block

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:59.390
3E1 something is here and
3F2 something is here.
