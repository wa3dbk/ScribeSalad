00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.630
So let me start this video by saying that

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.350
in case this code did not work for you,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.730
ask us questions on the discussion forum. We are

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.740
here to help. Now, you may be curious about

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.040
this file called fresh_tomatoes, so let's talk about it

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.740
next. Now, I want you to recall that this

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.360
file, fresh_tomatoes.py, had a function inside it called, open_movies_page.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.560
Now this function, receives a list of movies, and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.630
then, creates and opens an HTML file or a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.470
webpage that showcases those movies. By the way, it stores

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.580
this HTML file, in the exact same folder, as

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.250
all of your other movie program files. So let me

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.570
go to that folder now. And here is my

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.950
movies folder, with all of my Python movie files right

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.790
here. Notice that this is the HTML file that we

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.730
just created by running our program. This is the file

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.970
that actually showed us all of our movies and

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.370
played the trailer. And here is the fresh_tomatoes Python

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.270
file that you downloaded from our website. Let me

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.250
open it. Alright. Here is the code for our

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.880
Python file, fresh_tomatoes.py. Now, while I won't go through

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.560
this entire code in detail, I encourage you to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.360
read through this program. I want you to understand

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.490
how it takes in a list of movies and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.230
creates a website to show those movies. Now, we've added

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.100
comments to this file that will make this code readable. Alright

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.160
the next thing we want to do is we want you to

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.901
share the movie website that you've created thus far. So here's

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.523
your task, we want you to create your very own

00:01:33.523 --> 00:01:37.332
movie website with your favorite movies. Once you've done that we

00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:40.041
want you to share any one of the following two things

00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.880
with us on the forum. You can take a screenshot or

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.384
an image of your movie website and share that with us on the

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:50.326
forum, or if you have access to a smartphone we want you to record

00:01:50.326 --> 00:01:55.460
and share a YouTube video of you showing your movie website to a friend.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.920
Once you've submitted your responses on the forum, make sure to check this box.
