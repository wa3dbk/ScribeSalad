00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Splitting up words by spaces is such a common task in computer science

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that Python has a built-in function, string.split(), that does just that.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For example, suppose we take one of Charlotte Bronte's books as a string

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we call split on it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll get out a list where each element of the list corresponds

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to one of the words in this string separated by spaces.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This space here leads us directly to this comma, separating these list elements.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's take a moment now to get a little more practice with this new approach

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to splitting by whitespace.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Whitespace is just a more formal name for some series of spaces or tabs.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Here I've written three Python expressions, each one of which is a constant string.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We're calling split on it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'd like you to fill in each box with the number of elements in the list returned

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
by the split expression.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.872
You can use the interpreter if you like, but try to reason it out no your own.
