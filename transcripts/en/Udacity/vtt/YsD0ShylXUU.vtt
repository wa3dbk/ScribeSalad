00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.815
The fast Fourier transform is
an instance of the discrete Fourier

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:08.508
transform, which as we've said has its
own significance in various branches of

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:13.220
mathematics, physics and engineering,
signal processing most especially.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.756
In the study of algorithms,

00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:18.725
however, the fast Fourier transform
is most interesting for its role and

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:23.620
a very practical and very fast way of
convolving two sequences of numbers.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.303
We'll illustrate
convolution by an example.

00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:30.888
We're given two sequences of numbers
shown here, we'll call them a and b.

00:00:30.888 --> 00:00:36.609
And we want to obtain a new sequence
defined by this formula here,

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:42.434
where the kth element in the sequence
is the sum from 0 to k over i and

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:45.270
ai times b sub k minus i.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.587
We can visualize convolution by
reversing the order of b and lining it

00:00:50.587 --> 00:00:56.101
up with a, so that the the 0th element
of b is under the kth element of a.

00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.697
This is the alignment for k equals 0,

00:00:58.697 --> 00:01:03.496
then we multiply all elements that
overlap and add up these products.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:08.894
For k equals zero,
this is 2 times 1, which is 2.

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:12.562
So we'll write down
that C0 is equal to 2.

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:17.771
For k equals 1, we shift the sequence
over, multiply the corresponding

00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:22.825
elements and add those up, that is
a total of zero and that becomes C1.

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:26.521
For K equals 2 we shift
the B sequence over again,

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:31.802
multiply the corresponding elements and
add them up for a total of 5 and

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:36.906
we continue sliding b along doing
these products and then summing all

00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:43.350
things together and we keep doing this
until there is no more overlap left.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.724
Convolution has many applications, but
the one that will be most convenient for

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:50.246
us to talk about is
multiplying polynomials.

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:54.666
Given two coefficients of polynomials,
we can find the coefficients of

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:58.802
the product just by convolving
the two sequences of coefficients.

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:02.114
In fact, we can easily repeat
the example we just did, but

00:02:02.114 --> 00:02:04.827
in the context of
polynomial multiplication.

00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:08.814
First, I lined things up, so
that we get the constant terms and

00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:10.180
that product is two.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.997
Then we line them up, so
that we get the linear terms, 0 times x.

00:02:14.997 --> 00:02:18.110
Then we line them up, so
we get the quadratic terms.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.420
5 time x squared and so forth and so on.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.020
How long does this process take?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.930
Well, for each element in the longer
sequence, we had to do as many

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.320
multiplications and additions as there
are elements in the shorter sequence.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.187
Sometimes it will be a little
shorter around the edges,

00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:40.177
because the shorter one ran off
the edge of the longer one.

00:02:40.177 --> 00:02:42.681
But on average,
it was at least about half.

00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:47.413
Therefore, we can say that convolving
two sequences via the naive

00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:52.317
strategy outlined here, takes theta
n times m operations where n and

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:55.650
m are the lengths the sequences.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.670
The Fourier Transform will give
us a way to improve on this.
