That's right. With a touch input type in particular

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.670
we can easily get multiple touch move events, inside a

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.080
single rendering frame refresh. It's pretty silly to try

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.800
to paint the screen multiple times during a single video

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.790
frame. We're just wasting work like we learned about

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.530
in the last lesson in performance. So, it's even more

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.540
important when writing touch event handler code. To not

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.810
actually draw things, inside that touch event handler. But actually,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.810
buffer them up and paint them inside a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.750
request animation frame handler. Now, you may have

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.900
noticed, that inside my synthesizer, I'm actually setting

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.050
classes, which cause CSS refreshers in response to touch

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.620
messages. This could be a problem, except that

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.450
setting that class happens relatively infrequently. It only happens

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.760
when you transition from one key to another.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.870
So ,it's not causing multiple refreshes per paint cycle.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.790
Which is what we're, really trying to avoid.
