00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.416
This pattern is called the difference of squares. Because here, we have two

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:08.911
squares, and we have the difference of them. A subtraction sign or a minus sign

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.581
means difference. Using our pattern, what's the product of 8 minus 3y times 8

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:15.408
plus 3y? Put your answer here.
