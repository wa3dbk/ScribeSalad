&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So just about any shape can be made with 3D printing then? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, and in

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:08.434
fact, the coolest part about 3D printing and the things that I think is the most

00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:12.836
untapped source of 3D printing is that you can really make anything with 3D

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:19.217
prints. So we can get way beyond what we used to do, or take as manufacturing, I

00:00:19.217 --> 00:00:24.351
guess you'd call them design constraints. Where, those, one of those design

00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:28.566
constraints is now leaving. So we can really get into what does good design

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:28.929
mean.
