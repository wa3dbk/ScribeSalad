00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.551
So let's go back to our dig a hole example.

00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:05.120
If we're going to dig a hole, we're really interested in 2 things.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.723
One is how long it's going to take to dig that hole,

00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:11.524
and 2, how much work, how many total hours it will take to dig.

00:00:11.524 --> 00:00:15.918
If you're the only one digging this hole, these 2 things are the same.

00:00:15.918 --> 00:00:20.924
So we have 1 worker, and perhaps it's going to take you 8 hours to finish,

00:00:20.924 --> 00:00:24.620
and so that means overall you're going to do 8 hours of work.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.265
But if you bring all your friends over to dig the hole with you,

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:31.247
the amount of time to finish and the total amount of work might be different.

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:32.913
So now we're going to have 4 workers,

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:38.784
and perhaps they'll work together for 8 hours total and thus be able to finish in 2 hours.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:41.886
Thus they've finished digging this hole 4 times as fast.

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:46.171
We'd actually call this ideal scaling since adding 4 times as many workers

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.640
allowed us to finish 4 times as fast.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.800
Alternatively, we might have 4 diggers, each of which gets in each other's way,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.869
so we're not going to be quite as efficient.

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:58.969
So, for instance, we might have 4 workers, and together it's going to take them 4 hours to finish,

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.542
thus meaning that together they've done 16 hours of work.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.653
Now you might reasonably ask yourself

00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:08.578
why your instructor spends so much time talking about digging holes, and that's a fair point.

00:01:08.578 --> 00:01:12.178
But there's a couple of important points of terminology that I want to make here.

00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:14.691
The first is the concept of a step.

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:21.493
It's how long it takes to complete a particular computation--Operation Hole Digging.

00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:25.563
The second is the total amount of work that it took to perform that computation

00:01:25.563 --> 00:01:28.269
over all the active workers.

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:31.708
And so we're going to go into a little more depth in terms of the way that we define these.
