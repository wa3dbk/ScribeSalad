00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.952
In the last quiz we determined an interval estimate that you're likely to make

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:10.063
with either major. So, in the case of nursing majors, between 50,000 and 60,000

00:00:10.063 --> 00:00:15.229
and in the case of geography majors, between 40,000 and 55,000. But ideally, we

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:20.413
want one number that describes the entire data set, this allows us to quickly

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:25.141
summarize all of our data. Here's an analogy. Let's say you're describing

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:29.740
someone to a friend, there are a few words that you could use to describe that

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.339
someone like, tall, dark and handsome. Sometimes, 3 words will be accurate

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:38.803
descriptions, but let's say you can only choose one, cus you want to quickly

00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:43.343
describe this person. Which word would you choose? The same with data, and just

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:47.501
like there are multiple words that could describe a single person, there may be

00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.454
multiple numbers used to describe the whole data set.
