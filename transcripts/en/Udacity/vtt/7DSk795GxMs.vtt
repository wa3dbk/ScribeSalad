00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We know from computer science theory from people like Alan Turing

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that languages like Python and JavaScript are equally powerful.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You've seen half of that here when we wrote an interpreter for JavaScript in Python.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We might wonder are natural languages equal?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Mandarin, Hindi--are these languages all equal in every way?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This idea is actually not universally accepted.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Does every French utterance have an equivalent Japanese utterance?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The Sapir Whorf hypothesis--or linguistic relativity hypothesis--in linguistics

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
holds that the structure of a language influences the ways in which speakers reason

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
about the way world.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is still hotly debated. Language is generally held to influence thought.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
For a chilling fictionalization, I encourage you back again to George Orwell's 1984.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
However, in computing in unnatural languages like Python and JavaScript,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we can have definitive answers based on mathematical proofs.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There is a very strong sense in which Python, JavaScript, C, C++, C-Sharp, and Java

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
can all do exactly the same range of computations--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
those that can be done on what's known as a "Turing machine,"

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a mathematical model of computation.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
However we won't talk about Turing machines in detail in this class.

00:01:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
