00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.593
So, we just showed that the domain and the range function are both all the real

00:00:05.593 --> 00:00:11.190
numbers. But still, from looking at this graph, points B and D seem to stand

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.976
out. As we saw before, B and D both represent changes in the direction of, of

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:18.496
the slope of the graph. They also kind of look like a peak and a valley. Now,

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:22.863
let's compare this to another kind of peak or valley that we've seen before.

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:26.912
Now, let's say that in addition to this curve, we have a second one on the set

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:30.342
of axes. It's another function, and this time, it's just a parabola, a shape

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:34.454
that we've seen many times before. Now, I'm going to label the vertex on this

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:39.104
parabola, which we know is a special point for it, and I'm going to call that

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:43.226
point G. I've given you four choices to choose from to figure out what is

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:47.450
special about points B, D, and G. Is one of them a global minimum, or a global

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.891
maximum, or a relative minimum, or a relative maximum? Please pick the proper

00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:53.280
letter to go in each box.
