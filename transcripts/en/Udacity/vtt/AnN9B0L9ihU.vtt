00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.510
Statecharts are a precise way of modeling the behavior of

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.870
complex reactive systems. Such systems are ubiquitous and

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.790
errors can lead to safety, security, and usability problems. In this lesson,

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.940
we will go through an exercise in modeling the behavior of a common clock radio.
