00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.120
We talked about calculating totals for a student, but there was another

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.574
important use for this 2D array. We wanted to be able to tell if there was a

00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:10.505
particular topic that my friend needed to spend more time on. Let's write a

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:15.332
method that calculates the sum for each column. So it would return an array

00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:20.660
whose size matches the number of topics. And those values should be the some of

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.770
all of the students scores for that topic. So in this case, the array would

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.078
look like this. If you're ready to go this method, skip ahead. If not, I'll do

00:00:30.078 --> 00:00:33.996
a short example first. Let's say I want to calculate the total for multiplying

00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:38.860
fractions. I would want to add this this spot, and this spot, and this spot.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.698
This one is the zeroth student, and the second topic. This one is the first

00:00:42.698 --> 00:00:47.756
student, and the second topic. This one, is the second student, and the second

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:48.980
topic.
