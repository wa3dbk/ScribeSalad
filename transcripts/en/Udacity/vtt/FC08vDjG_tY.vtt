00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's the strategy that I would suggest. There's probably a couple of different ways to do this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We could take the original graph that we know there is some length l path, simple path from U to V

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and what we can do is for each edge in the graph say, well, what if we delete that edge?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Is there still a path? And if the answer is yes, then we just leave it deleted.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But if the answer is no, that we've now actually broken a path from the last path from U to V

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of length at least l in G, then we need to leave it in there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We keep repeating this until all the edges have been considered

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and all that's left at the end will be the simple path.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Why, because if there's any edges in there that's not on the simple path then

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we can delete it and there still is a simple path

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and certainly we can't delete any of the ones on that simple path and still have it work.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What's left is exactly what we need.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Here's my attempted datas Python code, so again,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we check first to make sure that there really is such a path and if there isn't,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
then we just quit before we try to find it, but if there is, so somewhere in there, the path exists,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
what we're going to do is run through all the edges, so node1 in G, look at all the neighbors.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Look at node2 which is the neighbor of node1. So now node1, node2 is an edge in the graph

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and we're going to break the link. I probably should've mentioned that earlier

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but there is actually a break-the-link piece of code int he skeleton that I gave you.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In graph G, get rid of the edge from node1 to node2.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You can do that in constant time and then we ask,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
is it the case that there is still a long and simple path, we ask for the decision.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Is there a long and simple path in G from U to V of length l?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And if the answer is no, if there's not such a path then we need to put that edge

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
back in the graph; otherwise, we just leave it out.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We'll repeat this for all the nodes, all the edges, and then we're basically done.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
All that's left in G is exactly the simple path and now we have to read it out.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It's a little bit messier than I thought it would be, but it's definitely doable.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You could run that graph search on this graph and that would work

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Because all that's left is the path that you want but another way to do it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that's more specific to this case is we start off building our path from U,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
we're going to have a variable node which is a particular point in the chain.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
In the variable next which is the next point in the chain

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and we start that off with whatever is the neighbor of U.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Notice there can only be one neighbor of U because all that's left is the simple path from U to V.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Okay, all right, so now, we say as long as that next node that we're looking for isn't V,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
we append next to the path so far so we have the first two steps and now we're at a new node,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
this node next is going to have two neighbors, one is going to be the node we just came from, node.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And the other one is going to be a new node that we haven't considered yet.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
To figure out which one it is, what I did is I just pulled the two of them off.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I said let the nextnext0 be one of those neighbors and nextnext1 be the other.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
If nextnext0 is the node we just came from, then we're going to move one step along the chain.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Node gets next and next gets nextnext1, the one that we haven't visited and; otherwise,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
next gets nextnext0, the one we haven't visited.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
When that loop is all through, then next is V, the very last step on the path

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and which add that into our path and return it.
