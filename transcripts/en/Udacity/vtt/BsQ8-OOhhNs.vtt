00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.766
Now try to do this in a more general fashion. I'm looking for a function, y of x, the derivative of which is

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:16.132
minus three times its value for every x, and its initial value for x equals zero should be five.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:25.799
What's that function? Enter your solution here. A number, possibly negative, times E to a number,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.000
possibly negative, times X.
