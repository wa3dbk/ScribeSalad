You may remember from the consciousness lesson, when we discussed the potential

00:00:04.558 --> 00:00:08.706
effectiveness of MDMA in treating post-traumatic stress disorder, so now let's

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:14.322
recap PTSD. PTSD often develops after someone is exposed to a terrifying event

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:20.156
that involves physical harm or the threat of physical harm. And someone with

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:24.540
PTSD often feels frightened or stressed. Even when they're no longer in harms

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.935
way. Exposure to natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunami's, or

00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:35.062
even earthquakes can cause PTSD. Exposure to war whether or not you're a

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:41.507
soldier, prisoner of war, or even a bystander of war, can result in PTSD. And

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:45.854
physical or sexual assault or even losing a loved one suddenly can result in

00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:47.251
PTSD.
