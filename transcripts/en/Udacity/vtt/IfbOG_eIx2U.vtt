In lesson two,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.880
we looked at different ways that IOS
apps present multiple pages of content.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.740
We said that we'd return for
a deep dive into how side to

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.400
side navigation presentation works,
and here we are.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.966
Using navigation controllers is
an absolutely fundamental skill.

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:19.350
We're also going to take one more step
with the iTable views and make and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.110
app that responds when
a user taps a table row.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.530
An essential interaction when
navigating a multi page app.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.850
Let's look at a few examples
of side to side navigation.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.750
Here in the settings app,
you can see that taping on a cell drills

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.260
down into the next layer of
the navigation hierarchy.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.490
The settings app has multiple layers.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.210
Let's say,
I want to change my Siri settings.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.780
I tap General and then Siri, Language,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.570
and then I can give Siri
an Australian accent.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.870
I can always return to the previous
view with this Back button,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.160
ultimately bringing me back
to the root view controller.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630
Notice how intuitive this flow is.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.990
Users have come to expect this type of
movement through a layered structure.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.400
If you take advantage of iOS UI
conventions in your app design.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.060
Your users won't need to be told how
to find what they're looking for.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.110
But let's check out the IOS music app.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.330
If I go into the more tab it
brings up a table of options.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.660
Then if I drill down into genres and
country, eventually.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.130
I can bring up the songs from
my favorite show Nashville.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.490
You can see how you table
views are in IOS apps.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.390
This action button on the right takes me
to the song that's currently playing.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.573
Once in the player, this action
button brings up a with album info.

00:01:31.573 --> 00:01:33.590
Have a close look the nav bar.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.710
The back button and
the title are standard.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.050
They're always there.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.260
The action button on
the right is optional, but

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.880
something you'll see frequently.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.200
How does the app know where to go,
when the back button is pressed?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.760
When we drill past a page of content,
where does it go?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.710
In other words,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.900
what kind of state is being managed
by this navigation controller?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.940
We have to figure all of this out.
