Related to interactive rendering, what the biggest surprise to you over the

00:00:02.854 --> 00:00:06.686
past ten years? Is there any new capability, platform or social phenomenon that

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:08.520
has stood out in your mind?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.820
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that the way the games industry is really driving the graphics hardware

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.329
vendors is very interesting to me. I've gone through several cycles in my

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.255
career where the hardware goes from, let's have a separate card for graphics,

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:23.770
to let's put it back on the CPU to, let's go back out to, to the graphics card.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.841
And it sort of has this, this cycle. And, now we're seeing the point where,

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.495
graphics cards have more power than the CPU, in many cases with, with all the

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:37.034
cores in them, and the program-ability. And the way that the vendors are

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:39.894
working together with the games developers and with the other developers, we

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:44.629
try to figure out what is going to keep programmable. And, as you know, if you

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.689
can turn a given algorithm into a fixed function and just, hard code into

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.106
transistors, you get much better performance like texturing.It's one of those

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:56.250
things where. Originally was programmable, but then they put it into a fixed

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.096
function to get the performance out of it. So working together with the

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:04.066
industry I really like the way that's going. I didn't see that as much 20 years

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:08.575
ago. with the card vendors. They were sort of on their own, but now they have

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:10.370
that collaboration going on.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.234
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I mean, I think, what we see with, you know, mobile and handheld devices is

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:20.022
really a big disruption and, you know, it has been amazing what's happening

00:01:20.022 --> 00:01:25.038
here like how much the amount of rendering power you have like in your pocket

00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:32.630
every day. And often I think like one way of, you know, just seeing how amazing

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.052
it is like if you sit down like in an airplane, where they have another of

00:01:36.052 --> 00:01:39.590
those like touch screen devices, but it's often like five or ten years old

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.128
because you know the upgrade cycles for airlines is so long, it looks like

00:01:43.128 --> 00:01:50.707
stone age technology compared to what you have in your pocket. So you know,

00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:54.535
that, that's obviously something that is happening now, and it's, it's pretty

00:01:54.535 --> 00:01:55.880
amazing.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.060
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; With internet, I mean when I started doing rendering it was very much on a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.402
desktop, you hit the Render button, and you came back the next day. And that

00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:07.962
was like a big thing for me and a big problem. so now to see live interactive

00:02:07.962 --> 00:02:12.829
web rendering is kind of blowing my mind. And I'm just, I know that soon we'll

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.246
be able to model and completely render lighted objects without having to you

00:02:16.246 --> 00:02:20.622
know, hit the Render button and, and dread the results, yeah.
