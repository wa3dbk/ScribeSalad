00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.870
Because Quicksilver is a distributed operating system,

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.160
IPC both within, and on the local data

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.050
network is a crucial component of Quicksilver. And

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.770
this picture shows the semantics of the IPC

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.750
call. In the kernel, there is a

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.166
data structure called service queue. Which is created

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.247
by the server that wants the service, request

00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:26.054
from clients. And clients make a request, and

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:28.230
the kernel does an upcall to the server to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.264
indicate that this is a client's request. The server

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:35.467
executes the upcall associated with this particular request. When

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:38.517
it completes the request, the completion, goes back into

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:42.170
the service queue. And that is an indication for

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.860
the kernel, to give a response back to the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.530
client. So then the synchronous client call where the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.080
client is waiting, til the request is actually serviced,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.230
and the completion response comes back to

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.250
the client. And the service queue, is a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.930
global service queue, just like UNIX socket.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.320
So any process, anywhere in the network, which

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.080
has knowledge about the service queue, can

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.854
connect to it and make requests on the

00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:12.230
service queue. And so nearly any server process

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.340
in the entire distributed system can service requests

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
that are coming into the service queue. And

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.170
there are some fundamental guarantees provided by Quicksilver

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.710
for interprocess communication which includes no loss, or

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.970
duplication of requests. So the request comes in,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.540
it will get done exactly once. And it

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.952
also ensures that there's no duplication. It also

00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:37.895
ensures that there is no loss of the

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:41.668
request. And Quicksilver also takes care of the liability

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:46.365
of the data transfer that is inherent when the client and the server, are

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:49.987
on remote machines. And because the service

00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:54.565
queue data structure is globally unique for every

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:58.228
such service. There is location transparency, for

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:01.240
client server interactions. Or in other words

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.784
a client does not needs to know, where in the network its particular request is

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:11.793
being serviced. For that is yet another feature of the IPC

00:02:11.793 --> 00:02:17.380
guarantee. Or the IPC call can also be asynchronous. What that means is,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.560
the client can make a request asynchronously. And continue with its

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.730
own execution, whatever it wants to do, it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.830
doesn't have a block on this. The kernel is

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.120
going to take the same action, and that is, if

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.940
there is a server that is available, then the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.280
kernel is going to pass it to that server to execute

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.410
that request. And, when the completion comes back in, it is

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.070
buffered in the service queue by the kernel, waiting for

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.230
the client to come back, and ask for the response. So

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.840
the client, at some point, has to do a wait

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.340
on the service queue to indicate that I'm ready to receive

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.640
the response that may have come, back for the request

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.980
that I made earlier. And when the client does the wait,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.620
if the original request has already been serviced by

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.860
the server, and the response is sitting in the service

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.100
queue, then the kernel, will deliver the response to

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.950
the client. If not, the client will wait until the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.970
response comes back. So this is the asynchronous client

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.460
call, but in either case, as I mentioned earlier. The

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.810
IPC guarantees hold that there is no loss of

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.145
the request, and there is no duplication of the request.

00:03:22.145 --> 00:03:23.780
As you can see from the semantics

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.930
that I described just now, that Quicksilver IPC

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.460
is very similar to remote procedure call.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.630
In fact, the remote procedure call paradigm was

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.600
invented around the same time as the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.190
Quicksilver Operating System. And since all services are

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.790
contained in several processes, IPC is fundamental

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.463
to Quicksilver. The IPC semantic supported by Quicksilver

00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:51.912
allows, multiple servers to wait on a service queue.

00:03:51.912 --> 00:03:54.024
And the way they will do that is by making

00:03:54.024 --> 00:03:57.416
a call called offer which is essentially saying, I'm willing

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:00.727
to offer my services for this particular service queue. Any

00:04:00.727 --> 00:04:03.311
number of servers can make this offer and that

00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:06.643
essentially means that if a request comes in, thatany one

00:04:06.643 --> 00:04:09.703
of these servers can be called by the kernel depending

00:04:09.703 --> 00:04:12.831
on the busyness of the servers with respect to handling

00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:15.551
requests that have come in for the service queue

00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:19.800
in the past. The client server relationship is interchangeable. For

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.140
example, a client can make a call on a

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.330
file system server and the file system server in turn

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.350
makes a call. To a directory server and a

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.070
call to a data server. So, in this case, the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.740
file system becomes the client to the directory server

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.130
and the data server. So in that sense, the client

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.580
server relationship is interchangeable. Now the only

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.280
reason for me to spend some time

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.300
describing the IPC semantics of Quicksilver. Is

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.750
because the recovery mechanism is tied intimately with

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.430
the IPC. And in fact, that's how you can have the cake and eat it too in

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.862
Quicksilver. In other words, the client server interactions have to use IPC. So

00:05:03.862 --> 00:05:08.738
the recovery mechanism, using transactions, rides

00:05:08.738 --> 00:05:12.342
on top of the IPC, essentially bundling

00:05:12.342 --> 00:05:15.416
the recovery mechanism with ICP to

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:18.370
get it cheaply. Another interesting footnote I

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.668
wanted to mention. The Quicksilver system was first conceived in the early 80s,

00:05:23.668 --> 00:05:29.057
but the first paper that described it appeared in 1988. And this is certainly

00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:32.876
the difference between academic research and industrial research

00:05:32.876 --> 00:05:36.580
at least in the olden days. Academic research,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.020
we tend to shout often. I'm an academic myself, so I take part of the blame.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.300
At least in the olden days, industrial research

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.180
used to take the approach of publishing, a

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.700
paper, especially in systems designed, when it is

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.749
fully cooked. Like I said, Quicksilver was designed and

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.849
implemented in the early 80s, 1984 to 88, but the

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.455
first paper came out in 1988. But nowadays I have to

00:06:02.455 --> 00:06:06.485
mention that everyone is shouting often, which explains the proliferation

00:06:06.485 --> 00:06:09.820
of conferences that you see around the country and the world.
