00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.590
So in the build your portfolio,
the first thing that you're looking for

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.769
is the design of the page itself and so
we want the DOM tree to correctly present

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.720
the page content elements there.
We want to see use of symmetric tags

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.760
wherever appropriate and
that there is a grid and

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.390
basic layout used in your markup.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.600
So I guess I would start with
the first part of this which says

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.860
the DOM tree correctly presented and
provided. Ops! 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.840
Sorry. Provided...

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.900
the DOM tree correctly present the page content.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.300
So what is DOM tree, Poornima?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.670
&gt;&gt; So it's essentially,
a document object model is nothing but

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.760
an in-memory representation of
your HTML page provided to you.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.340
So what it is.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.120
It's like a tree structure and

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.480
it arranges all these HTML
elements hierarchically.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.735
So that's what it's doing and.

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:14.485
I could actually show you guys
how you can represent a dom tree.

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:15.765
So if you see.

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:18.315
I have a very basic HTML document.

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:20.985
A HTML document that has a head.

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:24.435
And the head has a title
followed by the body.

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:25.835
Which has nothing essentially.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:26.575
For now.

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:29.265
And then I close the HTML tag.

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:34.560
So how do I represent this
code in the form of a tree?

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.610
So what you do is you have the root
followed by the parents, and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.490
the siblings, and its child.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.750
So the HTML is the root element in
the DOM tree followed by two siblings.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.620
So two children sorry,
which is the head and the body.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.230
So these are essentially siblings,
the head and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.050
the body are siblings they
are the child off the HTML element.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.435
And then followed by the head has
another child which is the title and

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:12.305
then the title has a string that is the lead
&gt;&gt; The title of the page.

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:12.995
&gt;&gt; Yeah the title of the page.

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:16.955
And then the body just has 
a string called tag

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:19.195
which is the body.

00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:22.565
So as you can see this is
how the DOM tree is formed.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:23.065
So.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.180
However if you represent your page.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.890
If you code in your HTML document and
then draw,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.770
Make a DOM tree out of it.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.990
It should, both of them
should make sense so.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.520
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; You should be able to map

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.680
the DOM tree to a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.445
&gt;&gt; HTML document.

00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:39.580
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
And then map

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.120
the html document to the DOM tree.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.420
So we need that to be appropriate
that's what we mean by the first part.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.683
Moving onto the next part

00:02:50.683 --> 00:02:56.100
It says base element used use
semantic tags where appropriate and

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.870
this also gets covered little bit
in your... In the associated class.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.760
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.970
&gt;&gt; But.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.160
&gt;&gt; Definitely look up semantic tags.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.410
What are semantic tags?

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.910
What are non-semantic tags?

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.398
And have a equal, healthy mix of both.

00:03:15.398 --> 00:03:18.420
Definitely they're wherever
required if you feel like you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.960
need to make use of semantic tags.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.988
Go ahead and do it.

00:03:21.988 --> 00:03:26.050
Non-semantic tags are just-
&gt;&gt; It's fast.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So somethings, so your div is just

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.380
creating an invisible box around
the content that you put inside your div.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.330
So that goes as a non-semantic element.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.460
Whereas your header
footer your articles.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.580
All of them are similar caption.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.650
&gt;&gt; Because they exactly
represent what element you

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.870
are going to be putting into your file.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.528
&gt;&gt; So those are semantic tags.

00:03:54.528 --> 00:03:55.375
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] So.

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.340
P tag may just tell
you it's a paragraph.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.160
But say you're adding
a caption to your figure.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.220
You would want to have a
figcaption tag which is semantic.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.275
It's adding meaning.

00:04:07.275 --> 00:04:09.236
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] yeah.
&gt;&gt; To what you are

00:04:09.236 --> 00:04:10.580
&gt;&gt; To what you are written and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.260
It's easier for human to read.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.940
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.110
&gt;&gt; And it's only for where appropriate
It's not where we ask you to completely

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:24.830
code your page with semantic tags we
do need an equal that makes very like,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.910
It's something that something that
is appropriate for your HTML page.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.410
So yeah.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.510
And the design uses a grid
based lay out principles and

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.390
this again can be a grid
that you build on.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.700
You don't necessarily
have to use Bootstrap.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.480
Although using Bootstrap is going
to make your life so much easier.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.320
&gt;&gt; Very convenient.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.030
And you'll learn more about
framework as you go through the but

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.398
very just most of the times
just the early phase here.

00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:53.060
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.690
But if you do want to get practice
it just loading up your own,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.820
go ahead and do that.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.880
We also check for responsiveness.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.910
With the build a portfolio website and
very responsive, we just.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.040
What responsiveness stands for
is being able to view your page

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.620
in a usable manner On
different types of devices.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.940
The ones we check for

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.940
is a small screen device in
the form of the Google Nexus 5.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.740
A tablet, we check it on an iPad.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.150
And a general laptop.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.286
so there and
again you want to add tags in

00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:39.370
appropriate width at which you want
to change the layout of your pages.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:46.250
In, in your project, but
a very easy way to visualize

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.380
what things would look like is by using
developer tools on your Google Chrome.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.696
And the way to access, and

00:05:53.696 --> 00:05:58.658
we're going to share my screen,
I guess, [CROSSTALK].

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.198
&gt;&gt; So
I have my rubric opened right now, and

00:06:01.198 --> 00:06:04.920
let's check out Udacitys responsiveness.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.240
So you want to go to that hamburger bar.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.240
Yeah.
And then what I do is I go to more tools

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.930
and click on developer tools.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.740
It's taking a while but it's there.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.925
So if you Instead, instead of using the
mouse, you want to use your keyboard.

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:22.770
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm
&gt;&gt; On a Mac you would go with

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.315
command shift and I together.

00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:26.500
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm
&gt;&gt; And on Windows, or,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.420
I believe,-
&gt;&gt; Control.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.285
&gt;&gt; Even on Linux you would go with
control shift and i together.

00:06:31.285 --> 00:06:31.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.490
And then.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.300
As you can see,
you can see a lot of tabs opening up.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.450
Oops, that shows a lot of code and
console logs.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.310
But let's see.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.960
Okay, so.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.880
Do you see this little, mobile device.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.110
I'm going to click that.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.520
So what it does is it
automatically changed.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.240
You know, and
your screen size have to move the.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.400
Yeah.
And As you can see the device tab shows

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.770
you all of the devices that
you can check your page with.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.270
So I'm going to check
the Google nexus five.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.270
And then what I'm going to do is,
it's showing me an error that says,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.760
you may have to reload your page for

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.890
proper user agents, so
I am going to reload this page.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.570
Oops, okay.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.410
&gt;&gt; And that's the way you're
going to see it on a mobile?

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.540
I'm going to shift to an Apple
iPad device and see how it is.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.320
I like this view better [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.390
&gt;&gt; So yeah, I'm going to reload it

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.970
again.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.670
Just to see how it's
rendering on an iPad.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.400
And yeah this is how it
looks on an iPad so and.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.080
It's as easy as this to actually
use the Google developer tools

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.340
to actually view your responsiveness
of your website and I think.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.250
All the developers all
the course developers,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.130
all of the coaches believe that start
designing for smaller devices first.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.800
Yes.
&gt;&gt; And

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.670
then go up, to tablet's and desktops.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.750
So, always think about smaller devices,
when you are with the coding and

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.570
your web page.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.420
&gt;&gt; There are more things we check for

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.890
in the first of which is
separation of concerns.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.290
And by that we mean we want to check
whether you have completely separated

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.860
your style, which is CSS,
from the structure, or the HTML.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.680
And we want to do this, honestly,
to just avoid confusion.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.230
You want to have that separation
between style and structure.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.080
And moving forward you learned that.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.025
It's an industry standard.

00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:40.360
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm
&gt;&gt; You do that?

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.058
So.
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:08:42.058 --> 00:08:44.140
&gt;&gt; You want to add
anything to that, Poornima?

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.245
&gt;&gt; No.
It's perfect.

00:08:45.245 --> 00:08:47.700
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah It's good enough.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.980
And it's very straight forward.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.010
And the rubric.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.830
So your structure is your HTML and
your style is your CSS.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.425
So yeah just make sure they are in
different files, and they don't get mixed.

00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:01.030
&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.410
&gt;&gt; Mixed.
I know that there are a lot of ways to

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.260
actually put in CSS
inside your HTML just

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.420
by adding your style tags-
&gt;&gt; Style, mm-hm.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.270
&gt;&gt; Or your script tags for your
Java Script inside your head element.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:20.390
And that's not usually a best practice
because you are reading CSS format

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.920
code at the beginning and then you
shift to HTML.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.040
All of a sudden.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.905
And it's just like,

00:09:27.905 --> 00:09:34.080
to see it's not very pleasant it's
not a very properly organized.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.500
And that's all we want you to
separate it into different files and

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.300
remember to have like a hierarchy in
your directories that you create.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.270
So have a CSS directory
where all your CSS files go.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.700
Right now for this project
you might have only one CSS.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.750
And one HTML file and no JavaScript
files, but it all is always,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.140
always cleaner to see code
which is properly structured.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.190
So you have CSS folders
and CSS files go in there

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.130
JS folders, JS files go in there. Images

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.040
Folder where your images go in and
then in your root directory you have

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.350
only your index.html or
whatever you name it as.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:25.150
&gt;&gt; I guess the biggest chunk of both
this project is the good quality.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:32.200
And what we check is whether the code
passes HTML and CSS validators,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.410
and is formatted in a way as
stated by the CSS style guide.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:45.350
And basically the style guide was
developed based on industry standards.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.110
So we want you to get
started with good habits.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.250
&gt;&gt; Most of the rules on that style
guide are pretty straight forward.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.120
There are some things which
are very important and

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.000
which you might not understand
while getting started.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.400
It's very difficult to detect those.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.250
So I guess we would get started
with telling them how to

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.080
detect these sort of
mistakes in their code.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.400
And these are formatting
mistakes nothing logical, right?

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.040
Your code might work fine, might render
great on the web page because it's

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.440
very smart, web pages are very smart.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.720
They can [CROSSTALK] The main character.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.040
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Typo, yeah.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.116
&gt;&gt; They can render with mistakes,
like even if you don't close tags or

00:11:28.116 --> 00:11:30.990
some sometimes they would render right.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:37.080
But there is a lot of things that
are missing in your formatting style in,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.880
that might be uncaught sometimes and
that's.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.580
I can understand that that.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.470
Totally happens to all of us and.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.030
&gt;&gt; It's these rules help us understand,
you know,

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.190
where we can do better in writing code.
