00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.568
To write this in exponential form we'll have a base of 2, raised to the x power

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:12.006
equal to 64. In order to solve for x, we need to rewrite 64 with a base of 2.

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:19.308
64 equals 2 to the 6th, so we have 2 to the x equals 2 to the 6th. Since the

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:24.163
bases are equal, we know the exponents must be equal as well. So x equals

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:26.663
positive 6.
