00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.765
We can also shift parabolas, or move them around on the coordinate plane. Let's

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:08.874
take a look at our original equation, y equals x squared. If we add 1 to the

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:15.864
equation, we can see that the entire graph shifts up 1 unit. Notice before that

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:23.510
the vertex was at 0,0. And now, our vertex is at 0, 1. By adding one right here

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.301
to the end of our equation, we really increase the y values from before by 1.

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:35.838
This is why the entire graph, the orange graph, shifts one unit up. So a point

00:00:35.838 --> 00:00:42.500
that was at negative 1, 1 is now at negative 1, 2. And a point that say was at

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.227
two comma four is now at two comma five. Notice how the y value increased by

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:55.544
one. We can also make this graph go up by two units, three units, four units,

00:00:55.544 --> 00:01:01.510
or even eight units. So, we can see that adding a constant term to the end of

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.746
our parabola, will shift it up. So, if we subtract a number, it will shift it

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:12.550
down. The parabola, y equals x squared minus 3, is our original parabola, only

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.662
it's been shifted down three units. And again, notice that the orange parabola

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:24.118
had a vertex of 0, 0. And this new parabola has a vertex of 0, negative 3. We

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:28.498
could even change this to be a negative 5, so that way the orange parabola

00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:33.990
would shift down 5 units. And again, notice that the vertex of this last

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.838
parabola is 0, negative 5. We can see that the y coordinate of the vertex comes

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:44.407
from here, this negative 5 is right here on our vertex. The x coordinate of our

00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:50.141
vertex is 0. And it turns out it comes from solving this binomial or setting

00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:56.432
this binomial equal to 0. X minus 0 is still x, so we know that this term is

00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:02.010
really still x squared. And if I graph this equation, I can see that there

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.435
exactly the same. I'm just writing this in a different form. So, now we can

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:12.326
quickly see where this vertex comes from in our equation. The 0 is here, and

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:17.860
the negative 5 is here. Now, we've seen shifting the parabola up and down.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.023
Well, we can also see a parabola shifted left and right. So, we know by adding

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:28.083
3 on the end, we could shift the parabola up 3 units. To shift the graph left

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:32.690
or right, we're going to change this binomial. If I subtract 1 from x, it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.089
really moves the graph one unit to the right. Now the vertex is here. Notice

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.929
that the sign of the x coordinate of the vertex is opposite from the one in

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:47.747
here. For a y equals parabola, we can set this binomial equal to 0 to find the

00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:54.968
x coordinate of the vertex. So in this case, x would equal one. The y

00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:58.274
coordinate of the vertex is simply found by the number that's added or

00:02:58.274 --> 00:03:01.340
subtracted at the end of the equation.
