00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.577
The painters algorithm works by drawing each object fully, in back to front

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:08.144
order. It depends on there not being any cycles where one object is in front of

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:12.940
another, which is front of a third, which in turn is in front of the first.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.320
This image has a red ring that is front of the green. The green is front of the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.393
blue and the blue is in front of the red. Given this cycle it certainly cannot

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:24.604
be rendered with painters algorithm if each ring is drawn as a whole. It's

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:27.548
possible to process the scene and break the objects into pieces that could be

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.920
drawn in the proper order but the basic Painter's algorithm clearly fails here.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.360
So this is the answer. By the way, these are called Borromean rings. No two

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.340
rings are linked to each other, but still all three are attached.
