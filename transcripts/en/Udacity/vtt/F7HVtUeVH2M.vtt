00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.894
It turns out that that something else is the square root of 2. When we multiply

00:00:03.894 --> 00:00:09.190
the square root of 2 by the square root of 2, we get the number 2. We know this

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.666
is true since we can rewrite this as the square root of 2 squared. We use our

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:18.915
knowledge of fractional exponents to rewrite this radical as 2 to the 1 half.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:23.140
We're raising a power to a power so we multiply these exponents together to get

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.259
2 times 1 half, or 2 divided by 2. This leaves us with 2 to the 1, which is

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.252
simply 2. Now, we're not so much interested in multiplication of radicals right

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:37.140
now, we'll run that later. But what we are interested in is the square root 2.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.745
This is an irrational number. And the irrational number is a number that

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:45.922
doesn't terminate. It means that whatever is after the decimal never ends. The

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:50.743
square root of 2 is about 1.4, but that's just an approximation. This decimal

00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:54.241
actually has an infinite number of places following the decimal point, it goes

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.394
on forever. So, when we think about irrational numbers, we're just thinking

00:00:58.394 --> 00:01:02.482
about numbers that can't be written as a fraction. It's not important to plug a

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:05.298
number like the square root of 2 into your calculator since we really only get

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:09.641
an approximation of that answer. Throughout the rest of this unit, we won't be

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:14.820
working with these crazy decimals. Instead, we'll just write the radical symbol

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.343
and the number.
