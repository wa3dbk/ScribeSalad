00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.080
I'm going to use the find method again. I need to find the

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.060
index of the person I want to move. In this example it would

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.120
be four. Then I need to remove them from that spot, so

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.100
that I won't have two copies of that person in the list. And

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.850
then the induces would change accordingly. Then once I've removed them, then

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.330
I want to add them at the front. I'm going to use add

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.390
instead of set, because I don't wipe to away the zeroth one,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.430
I just want to move everybody down. So now this will be zero,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.470
this will be one, two, three, four, five. In BlueJ that would look like,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.610
get the Old Index, by finding the Person. And then if that Person is already

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.779
a friend we remove them from their old position and insert them into the

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:42.930
zeroth spot. If they're not already a friend, then we don't have to do anything.
