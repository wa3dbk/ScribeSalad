00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.770
The SSL record protocol provides
two services for SSL connections.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.430
For confidentiality, the handshake
protocol defines a share seeker key

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.120
that is used for
symmetric encryption of SSL payloads.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.370
For message integrity, the handshake
protocol also defines a share seeker key

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.520
that is used to form a message
authentication code or MAC.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.540
This figure shows the overall
operation of the SSL record protocol.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.680
The first step is fragmentation.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.340
Each upper layer message
is fermented into blocks.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.180
Next, conversion is applied.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.540
Then the next step is to compute
the message authentication code

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.200
over the compressed data.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.270
Next, the compressed message,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.190
plus the MAC are encrypted
using symmetric encryption.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.200
The final step is to prepend a header,
which includes the version and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.460
length fields.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.910
Know that there's no distinction that's
made among the various applications

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.320
that might use the SSL record protocol.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.550
The counting of the data created
by these applications is opaque

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.350
to the SSL record protocol.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.530
The record protocol transmits
the data in a TCP segment.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.152
The receiving end decrypts the data,
verifies it, decompress it,

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:22.866
and reassemble the data and deliver
it to the higher layer protocols.
