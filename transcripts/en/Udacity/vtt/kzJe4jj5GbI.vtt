00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.740
This would be the factored form. Amazing work if you got it right. This one was

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.975
really tough. As always we want to look for a greatest common factor first. And

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:18.612
it turns out eight goes into both terms. So I have 8 times one minus 4x squared.

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:19.270
So we have a greatest common factor sitting on the outside, and a squared minus

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.731
b squared sitting on the inside. The a's really 1, since the quantity a squared

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:27.844
is 1. And the b is really 2x since this quantity squared is 4x squared. We keep

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:33.095
our GCF on the outside and then we factor using our pattern, a plus b and a

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:33.733
minus b.
