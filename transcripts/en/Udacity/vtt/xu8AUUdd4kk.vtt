Congratulations, you have
reached the end of lesson one.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.350
You've learned how to use an ORM to
create a database, and execute cred

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.790
operations on it, setting the foundation
for your interactive menu application.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.930
Next, in lesson two, you'll build
a web server that will be able to

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.620
perform these cred operations
based on requests from the user.
