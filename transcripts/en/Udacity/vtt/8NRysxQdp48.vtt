Given that we have to know a lot about a person to understand their

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:07.848
personality, it can be a hard thing to measure. However, we can measure it. So

00:00:07.848 --> 00:00:12.960
on that note, I want to take this quick personality assessment. It should only

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.038
take between five to 15 minutes. When you're done, write down the percentages

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:21.756
you got on the five categories and then let's talk about it. You'll find the

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:23.765
link in the instructor's notes box.
