00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.885
Great Android apps use context to
produce experiences that are useful to

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:07.410
users at the right time and
the right place.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.140
Our watch face can show users
contextually relevent data and

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.590
react to it by changing styles and
colors in your design.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.390
The first step in designing
a data integrated watch face

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.060
is to define the end result.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.680
What information that's available to
your app do you want your users to know

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.800
after they've glanced at your design?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.710
Your watch face might use data other
than time, such as weather, calendar, or

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.810
fitness data.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.760
Consider including data creatively.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.420
Avoid simply overlaying a time-based
watch face with extra data.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.010
Rather, think about how the data can
be expressed through the lens of time.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.960
For example, instead of designing
a weather-related watch face as

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.490
a clock with indication of the current
temperature in degrees overlayed,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.440
you might design a watch face like this
that describes how the temperature

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.000
will change over the course of the day,
rain, then sun.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.340
You could use colors to indicate
the kind of weather there might be.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.480
There are lots of possibilities.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.170
And, remember,
keep in mind glanceability for the user.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.050
They're going to be looking at this
watch face a lot during the day.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.230
Less is really more here.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.220
The simpler your message,
the stronger it will be.
