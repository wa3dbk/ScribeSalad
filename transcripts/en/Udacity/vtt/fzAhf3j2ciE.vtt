I want you to take this a step further.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.600
Instead of just removing the class featured from Article 2,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.380
can you also use the .toggle class method to add the class to Article 3 as well?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.280
There are a few ways to accomplish this, but

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.885
I recommend checking out the .next method to find the next sibling of Article 2.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.040
Check out the documentation for .next and give it a shot.
