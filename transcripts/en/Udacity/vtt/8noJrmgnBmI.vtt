00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're trying to figure out what the running time is asymptotically Θ

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
for selection and insertion as a function of n and K and then we can substitute in the value of K.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If there's n elements in our list and we're interested in the top K,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what the selection algorithm does is it goes through the elements one at a time

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and for each of these n elements it tries to figure out where in this list of K it needs to go.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
For each of these n, it does an insertion or a selection.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Okay, let's do insertion first. It does an insertion in this list. That insertion takes Θ(k).

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's basically running through this list, figuring out where the value goes,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
sticking it in, and shifting everything else over.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The insertion algorithm is going to take n times that for a total of Θ(nk). Now, selection is the same.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What happens in selection is you run through this list of n,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and you pull out the maximum and delete so that takes Θ(n)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and you repeat that once for each of the elements you want to pull out.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It becomes also Θ(nk).

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Sorting on the other hand sorts this entire list, which I said before was n log n.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Then, well, it's kind of done at that point but you could imagine also looping that through

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
like the first K elements but we basically have them at that point

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and K is smaller than n so asymptotically that's the whole running time.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, if K is n/2 that's n times n/2 where n².

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is Θ(n²). This is Θ(nlogn). We're much better with n log n.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
With the very long list that were wanting to tap values of,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
you might as well just sort the whole thing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
√n, well what happens with √n? √n where look we're comparing n log n to n(√n) which is n³/².

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
n³/² is asymptotically larger than n log n so we're still better off just sorting the whole list.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, let's go to the other side of the spectrum. What if there's 100 elements in the list?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Well if K is a constant, K is 100. Then the big theta of this is just Θ(n). It's a linear time.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So linear beats nlogn. So we'll definitely want to choose these algorithms

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
over sorting if it's a small number of elements that you want to know.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
loglogn is similar. We end up with n(loglogn), which is better than nlogn.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And finally I guess it'd be kind of obvious at this point if we substitute logn in for K,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
we have nlogn for selection insertion but we also have nlogn for sorting so they're actually the same.
