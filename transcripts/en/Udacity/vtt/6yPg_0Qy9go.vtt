00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.510
Let's discuss the solution to our BTB and BHT

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.167
quiz. We have a BHT that has 16 entries and

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:09.190
it's a 1-bit predictor. Each of the entries is a

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.070
single bit that tells us what the last outcome was.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.059
And initially they start off at predicting, not-taken. The

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.640
question was, how many mispredictions do we have for each

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.520
instruction? Initially the BHT says not-taken for all of the

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.460
entries and we have already seen that the BHT entry

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.018
that we will use are all different. So these

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:30.826
branches any other instructions are not going to interfere with

00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:33.038
each other. Each of them just uses its own

00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:37.060
BHT entry, because the initial prediction is not-taken. And

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.894
this is indeed not a taken branch. We have

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:43.713
0 missed predictions here, same here. When we enter

00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:46.998
the loop, this branch is actually not-taken, so we

00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:51.120
have no missed prediction the first time we execute it.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.336
This instruction here is predicted not-taken the first

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:57.920
time. It's not-taken for real, so every other time

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.116
that we execute it it's going to be predicted

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:03.760
not-taken correctly, so there is 0 mispredictions. And same

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.800
thing happens here, and here, and here. For

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.350
this branch, things are more interesting. The initial prediction

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.622
in the BHD is going to be not-taken, but

00:01:13.622 --> 00:01:16.533
this branch is taken, so we have a misprediction

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.290
the first time this branch is taken. Then,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.230
the BHT entry for that instruction is updated to

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.370
say taken, so every other time that we execute

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.950
this instruction it's correctly predicted as taken. So we

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.730
have only the one misprediction initially. For this

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.870
branch, it's never taken until the very last time,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.710
the 101st time we do it. Every time it's

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.570
not-taken, we have a correct prediction, because we start

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.880
out in the not-taken state of the predictor, and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.570
just keep doing that. The last time we need

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.714
to execute this branch, it is taken. And the

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:53.470
last outcome that we have seen was not-taken. So

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.280
there will be again a single misprediction here. So

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.520
as you can see the 1-bit predictor is very

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.306
accurate. We are executing a lot of instructions. This

00:02:04.306 --> 00:02:06.610
one is done a 101 times, this one is done

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.814
a 100 times, these are done a 100 times each. So, for what amounts to more than

00:02:11.814 --> 00:02:16.120
600 instruction executions, we only have two mispredictions. This

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.880
shows that the 1-bit predictor really works well for

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.735
things like loops that execute many iterations. However,

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:25.075
we will see later that it doesn't work well

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:27.740
for some of the other things like, for example,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.710
loops don't have many iterations or if then analysis
