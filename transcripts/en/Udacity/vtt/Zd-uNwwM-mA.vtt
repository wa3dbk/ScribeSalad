00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.420
So today we've talked about configuration, a kind of routine design task. We do

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.610
configuration when we're dealing with a plan that we've used a lot in the past,

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.330
we need to modify to deal with some specific new constraints. So for example,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.130
we've built thousands of buildings, and thousands of cars, and thousands of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.910
computers, and each of them is largely the same. But there's certain parameters,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.750
like the number of floors in a building, or the portability of the computer,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.300
that differ from design to design. So we need to tweak individual variables to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.310
meet those new constraints. We started this off by defining design in general,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.270
and then we used that to define configuration, as a certain type of

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.600
routine design task. We then discussed the process of configuration and how it's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.080
actually very similar to constraint propagation that we've talked about earlier.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.065
Then we connected this to earlier topics like classification, planning and

00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:45.810
case-based reasoning, and saw how in many ways, configuration is a task,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.070
while other things we've talked about provide us the method for

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.210
accomplishing that task. So now we'll move on to diagnosis,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.540
which is another topic related to design, where we try to uncover the cause of

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.720
a malfunction in something that we may have designed. In some ways,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.750
we'll see that diagnosis is a lot like configuration in reverse.
