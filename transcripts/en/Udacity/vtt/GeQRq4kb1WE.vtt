00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.990
Once you publish your app
to a distribution platform,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.060
the first thing that people will
notice is your game icon and name.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.700
Let's focus on the name first.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.310
Choosing your name strategically affects
where your game appears in search

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.610
results, and can help you stand
out from your competitors.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.250
Here are a few tips to consider
when you're thinking of a name.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.750
Keep it short and simple.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.020
Make it descriptive and make it unique,
which will make it easy to search for.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.930
Each app store has a maximum app
namel length, before it cuts off and

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.590
turns into ellipses.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.490
As you can see in this example,
Angry Birds Star Wars, and

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.840
Kingdom Rush Frontier are cut off.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.030
So make sure to keep your name
short enough to make it visible,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.560
especially the parts of
the names that are descriptive.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.440
Having a descriptive name is
really important because then,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.320
when someone browse the app store,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.795
they'll have an idea of what your game
is about, right when they see it.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:53.630
Here the name, Stack the States and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.850
Table Top Racing give us an idea of
what to expect in the game, even if

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.290
we've never heard of them before,
a stacking game and a racing game.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.870
You also want to have
a searchable game name.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.840
One that sets itself apart
from any similar apps.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.760
If you don't, you might end
up with too much competition.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.680
Like in the case of names that
involve flappy in their title.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.730
After the success of Flappy Bird, so

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.380
many other flappy apps popped up that
it was hard to tell one from the other.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.390
So choose a unique, descriptive,
and short game name.
