00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.469
Starting with the first diagram.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.730
We can see that for every one hardware
pixel across, we have one dip across.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.960
So, that's not the right answer.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.840
Here, for every three hardware pixels
across, we have one dip across,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.450
which would make a device
pixel ratio of three.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.750
And that's incorrect.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.550
Over on this one.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.420
Looking across, we've got about one and
two-thirds hardware pixels for

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.870
every dip, so that's not going to
give us the right ratio either.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.160
Which means of course in the last one,
where we have two hardware pixels

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.969
across, for every one dip across, that
gives us a device pixel ratio of two.
