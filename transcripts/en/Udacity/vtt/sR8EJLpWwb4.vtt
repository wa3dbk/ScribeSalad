00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.520
So the answer is, we only need to add one line.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.040
We need to add the line at line 13. And the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.520
line that we need, is to update the graph. So we're

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.290
going to have a new entry in the graph, that is the page

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.410
that we're crawling. So that's going to be the key for the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.760
entry that we want to associate with that page, a list of

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.125
the links. That you can reach from that page, all the

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:26.200
outgoing links. Well that's exactly what we stored in the variable outlinks.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.070
So that's the only line of code that we need to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.190
add, to produce the graph. We needed to initialize the graph

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.920
as an empty dictionary, we needed to change the return it.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.480
But the only substantive change, was adding this line. And, we'll run

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.090
that, we'll call crawl_web. Passing in the test URL. And this

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.968
time we have two variables on the left side. So we're

00:00:44.968 --> 00:00:48.030
going to assign the index to index. And we'll assign the graph

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.400
to graph. And let's check that the graph has what it should.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.520
So we'll print out to get graph entry for the index page. And, what we get, we

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.480
see a list of five URLs. Hummus, arsenic, kathleen. Nickel and zinc. And this

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.680
corresponds to the picture here. We had

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.240
five outgoing links from the index page to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.380
those five other pages. Let's look at another

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.540
one. We can print the graph for the

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.510
Kathleen page, and that had no outgoing links, so what we

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.500
see here is the empty list. And, we can see the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.720
whole graph, we have each URL. With a list of all

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.160
the pages that, that page links to. So both the Hummus and

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.470
the Kathleen page don't link to anything. The Zinc page links

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.290
to the Nickel page, and the Arsenic page, and so on.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.690
So now we have our graph. The next step is to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.670
figure out how to use that graph, to do the page ranks.
