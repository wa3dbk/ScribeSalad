00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.246
Psychologists use the general rule of 7 plus or minus 2 when referring to our

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:10.425
ability to chunk information into units. Meaning 7 digits or 9 digits, that

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:16.932
would be plus 2, or 5 digits, minus 2. So chunking is one way to remember

00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:20.906
things. But how do we get our short term memory to allow us to remember things

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:25.814
such as phone numbers or directions to the mall? Or even the vocabulary words

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:29.834
from this lesson? One theory by psychologist Alan Baddeley suggests that there

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:34.100
are three processes involved in working memory. The first is attending to the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.976
stimulus. That is, we're aware, or mindful of it. The second part of the

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:43.597
process is storing information about the stimulus. And the third part is

00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:48.096
actually rehearsing what is stored. Let's go to Susan for a little more detail

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:49.290
about this.
