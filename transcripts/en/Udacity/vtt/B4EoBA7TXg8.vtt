We should use line d. Remember, we can start graphing linear inequalities like a

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:09.841
line. We start with the y intercept, which is that positive 3. Then we travel

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:14.612
down 2 and right 3 units. We can continue doing that to get other points in the

00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:15.012
line.
