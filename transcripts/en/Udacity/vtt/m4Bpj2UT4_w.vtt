00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.450
What we're looking at, is a finite state machine, a state chart that is

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.590
carved up into a collection of concurrently executing sub machines. And

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.657
the one that we filled in, that pivotal state chart is labeled Display. And

00:00:14.657 --> 00:00:17.780
the Display, if you think about it, can be in one of three states.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.620
Either, it can be displaying the current clock time, time of day. The time when

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.830
you wish to be awoken. And, the amount of time that you'd like the radio to run,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.990
as you're going to sleep at night. And between these each status is an oval.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.890
And between the states are some transition arcs. And in this case to make it

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.620
a little bit simpler, we've abbreviated the two arcs, the ones that go back and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.920
forth with a single arc with double-headed arrow. But in general those are two

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.380
transitions and we have to take care that we represent them both
