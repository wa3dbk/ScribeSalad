There's one less area of consciousness that we're going to discuss before

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.775
moving on to sleeping and dreaming. This is meditation. Now, there's many

00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:11.114
different forms of meditation but, in essence meditation is the ability to

00:00:11.114 --> 00:00:14.904
become more mindful. Do you remember when we talked about mindfulness a little

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:18.830
while ago in the lesson? Well, by using different meditation techniques, people

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.158
who've been able to increase their ability to be more present, in the moment,

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:27.445
and also increase their attention to their thoughts and feelings. Once again,

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:31.867
research has demonstrated that those who score high in mindfulness also report

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:36.890
greater well-being. Reduction in stress and anxiety have also been reported for

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.130
those who practice meditation.
