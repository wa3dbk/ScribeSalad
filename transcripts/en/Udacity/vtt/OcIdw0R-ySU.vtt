The answer is android.permission.INTERNET. I'll show you now,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.380
where it's located in the code. Under the

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.180
main folder open up the Android manifest.xml file.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.660
Within the Android manifest file, we declare uses

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.800
permission, with the name of the permission. We

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.880
verified that the data returned is correct by

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.810
adding a verbose log statement for printing out

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.300
the forecastJsonStr. This is in the fetch weather task.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.830
We can verify that it's going to show up in the logs. For this example, I'm

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.890
going to use the command line. These are the real time logs, and then if I

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.120
hit refresh, then I see the weather data here. The verbose log, and this is our

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.040
log tag fetch weather task. Here's the forecastJsonStr,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.070
and this is all the output from the server.
