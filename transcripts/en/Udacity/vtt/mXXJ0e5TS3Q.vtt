00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.644
So once again, there are actually two ways
to solve this problem. The first way,

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:09.601
using PEMDAS again, is to add what's
inside the parentheses 2 plus 10, and then do

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:13.537
the multiplication. It's one to split this
into our two different methods. We can

00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:19.299
either say that we end up with 3 times the
quantity 2 plus 10 or 12. And then 3 times 12 is just

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:24.258
equals to 36. Or as we have learned before
we can use the distributive property. So,

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:28.683
if we want to do that, we first multiply 3
by 2 and then add whatever we get for

00:00:28.683 --> 00:00:34.619
that, 2 3 times 10. So if we write that
out if 3 times 2 plus 3 times 10 and then we evaluate

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:39.905
each of these terms individually, 3 times 2 is 6 and
3 times 10 is 30. And the end, that still gets

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:40.903
the same answer.
