00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we have seen that with assertions we can ensure that objects

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
are in a sane state all the time.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You can imagine that this would be most useful for large, complex data structures.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That is, structures with lots and lots of invariance that need to be maintained

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or that could possibly be violated due to programming errors.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let me illustrate this with one of the most devilish data structures ever invented,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is a Red-Black tree.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here's an example of a Red-Black tree.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
A Red-Black tree is a data structure to represent associative arrays

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
also known as mappings.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If I want to search an element in a Red-Black tree,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I can do so in an almost logarithmic time.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.977
And I do so as in all search trees by checking whether the element

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm searching for is smaller or larger than the element I'm looking at.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Suppose I want to check whether the number 22 is in my Red-Black tree:

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I start at the root, which is 13, I'm looking for 22, which is larger than 13,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so I go along the right branch, 22 is larger than 17, so again I go along the right branch,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
22 is smaller than 25 so now I go along the left branch,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
until I'll end up exactly in the element I was searching for.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Red-Black trees do not only guarantee search in logarithmic time

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but also insertion and also deletion, which makes them a real nice choice

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
for all sorts of search operations.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But they also are very, very difficult to debug.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The reason they're difficult to debug is they do have a number of properties

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that must be maintained at all times.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
To start with, they always must be trees. You can't have any cycle in it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
A black node must have red children, and a red node must have black children.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The number of elements in the subtrees should be fairly equal

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
with respect to the number of black nodes, and if some element points to a child

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the child maintains a pointer then this should point back to the exact same parent.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So search in Red-Black tree is easy but insertion and removal are really complicated.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
To get an idea just how complicated they are, let's take a look on Wikipedia

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
what they wrote about Red-Black trees.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So this is the Wikipedia page on Red-Black trees.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Here's the insertion. These are two helper functions, grandparent and uncle.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Now we go to 1, 2, 3 different cases all with individual code that needs to be handled.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Here's case number 4, and here's case number 5.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Removal is even more complicated. This is the formal description.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We need a helper function called the sibling.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here's a helper function to delete one child, which is easy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And now come all the special cases: case 1, case 2, case 3, case 4, case 5, and case 6.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And of course, you can imagine how easy it is to make mistakes in any of these cases.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It would have some pointer pointing to the wrong node,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and again it would easily create lots and lots of time bombs

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
which is why we normally do not implement Red-Black trees

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
but we rather rely on Red-Black trees as implemented in some library.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
However, if you were to implement a Red-Black tree,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
say part of a programming exercise for instance, it's cool.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Or you're working on something that's similar to a Red-Black tree,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
but which doesn't have yet its page in the Wikipedia,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
then you really need to make sure that you don't screw up things

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and that you don't create a time bomb in here.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
If you work on a data structure as complex as this,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the very first thing you need to write in an invariant checker.
