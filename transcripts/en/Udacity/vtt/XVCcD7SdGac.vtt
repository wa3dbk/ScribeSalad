00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
Based on the table we made in the last quiz, we can determine intervals in

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.151
which the two x-intercepts we can see in this part of the graph lie. So, we

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:12.461
have one x-intercept on the left, right around here, and one x-intercept to the

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:16.320
right, right around here. Please use the values of x from the table to tell me

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.550
the intervals in which you know that these x-intercepts have to lay. Don't

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.370
forget the intermediate value theorem. Think about how we have to use that in

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.763
this problem.
