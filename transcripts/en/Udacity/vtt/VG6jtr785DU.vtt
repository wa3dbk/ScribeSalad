00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.560
But what I'm going to do is show you.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.220
It's sort of a simple version of what's
called the likelihood ratio test.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.315
And here, we're basically assuming that
the cost of calling a skin pixel not

00:00:08.315 --> 00:00:11.820
skin, is the same as cost
calling a not skin pixel, skin.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.880
We can re-, we can re-weight these
things if the costs are different.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.930
The likelihood ratio test
says basically, look.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.280
It's just exactly what you think,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.410
if the probability that it's
skin given the skew measurement,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.180
is greater than the probability that
it's not skin, what am I going to do?

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.350
I am going to call it skin, right, that
assumes that the costs are, are equal.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.570
So using Bayes rule,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.990
p of skin given x is just p of
x given skin times p of skin.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.230
P of not skin, given x, is p of x,
given not skin, times p of not skin.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.640
So if this quantity is greater
than this whole quantity,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.200
we're going to classify x as skin.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.780
This is just a direct
use of Bayes' rule.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.940
And as I said before, we would change
the weights on two sides of that

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.020
equation if, if the costs of making the,
the mistakes were not symmetric.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.270
Allright?

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.970
So problem is that I really don't
know the prior of being skin.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.080
Allright, I mean, I,
I dunno [INAUDIBLE] Where is the prior?

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.110
So, the one thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to assume is it's a constant.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.780
I'm going to assume it has some number.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.310
Allright?

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.050
So the prior for a whole bunch
of pixels that I'm looking at,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.170
that are maybe of people or in an office
where there are people around.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.620
The probability that something
is skin is some number.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.680
Here's it's written as omega.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.070
So if you give me enough training data,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.540
that is you pay enough undergraduates to
circle all the skin areas on an image or

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.790
you do Mechanical Turk on Amazon to
indicate, to have the world out there

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.140
for a penny and a half a click to
say what's skin and what's not skin.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.120
You could estimate the prior
that any given pixel is skin.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.580
So, with this training data I
can also estimate that prior and

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.270
I can measure those likelihoods, right?

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.900
Those are the likely densities,
those histograms that I built,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.260
and remember I need two histograms.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.490
I need P of X given skin.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.690
What are the hues that
I get on the skin?

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.355
And P of X given not skin.

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:07.590
Allright, so with that same
training data that I used for

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.160
estimating the prior, I can also
estimate my likelihoods, allright.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.910
Which means I can more or
less come up with a rule.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.070
Basically what I'm going to do is, I've
got my priors, I've got my likelihoods,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.570
so I can just evaluate
p of x skin given x.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.160
And if it's bigger than some number,
some theta, okay?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm going to classify this
thing as skin, allright?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.880
That's it.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.780
Given some new image,
I want to label all my pixels.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.060
And here is a picture, this is
actually a picture of Gary Bradsky and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.230
the thing on the right is showing you
the probability of something being skin.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.770
And Gary actually was using this to
build perceptual user interface where

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.360
you can move your head around And
the world that you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.950
are looking at in some virtual rendering
will change as you move your, your head.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.000
And in fact here's two more pictures
showing you the orientation, right so

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.040
here it's pretty much straight up,
here he's, he's turned his head and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.280
all it's doing is tracking the skin
pixels of his face, that's all, alright?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.920
And in fact, Gary made use of this in
a cool little, track, remember we talked

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.450
about mean shift tracking just recently
actually, just a couple of lectures ago.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.830
Gary did sort of a different
version of that called cam shift,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.770
which was maybe a little easier to
implement sometimes, that's a pretty

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.140
highly cited paper, and it was basically
using these color distributions.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.500
In order to be able to track your
head and change what was rendering.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.470
In fact, the picture on your right comes
from his paper, where they were using

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.470
the Quake engine for
controlling a first-person shooter, and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.870
if you just turned your head, okay, the
thing would just movie with you, okay?

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.430
And it was just done by,
by tracking the skin pixels.
