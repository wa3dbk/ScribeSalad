00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.942
Well, the point slope formula takes a point written as x1y1 and a slope m. The

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:15.586
equation is then, y minus y1 equals m times the quantity x minus x1. In this

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:22.893
situation our point is 4,7 and m is negative 3. So the answer is y minus 7

00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:27.902
equals negative 3 times the quantity x minus 4.
