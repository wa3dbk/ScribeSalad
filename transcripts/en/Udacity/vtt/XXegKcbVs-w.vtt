00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.330
So I decided to take a look at one of my favorite websites,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.000
Netflix. I'm going to open up dev

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.180
tools by pressing Cmd+Option+I. Turn on emulation.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.790
And go into the timeline. I'll do a hard reload by

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.270
doing Cmd+Shift+R. We can see the events that happen as the

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.960
page is loading. Let's take a look at the first couple.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
We could see we send a request for the homepage here. This

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.700
is the HTML file that we need to load the page.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.970
Let's scroll down. We can see that when the HTML file

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.000
finishes loading, we then parse the HTML. Let's open this up.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.140
And we see a request for two different files, both called include.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.930
Clicking on the first one gives us this CSS file.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.000
Scrolling down, I think we can pick out two pretty obvious

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.660
optimizations just looking at this file. The first optimization is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.850
to minify the CSS or get rid of all the white

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.480
space. The white space in the file only helps us

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.610
read it. It doesn't help the browser parse the file. So

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.330
in fact, if we got rid of all the white space,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.810
we would remove a significant amount of bytes from our data.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.470
The second optimization is to inline critical CSS and we wouldn't have

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.150
to send out another request for this CSS file to style this page
