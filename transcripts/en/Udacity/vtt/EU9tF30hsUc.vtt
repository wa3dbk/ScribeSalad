00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.552
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's move away from solving systems of equations and think about which

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:07.455
method would work best. So here's a system of equations, and I want you to think

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.091
about, how should we solve this? So what do you think? Should we graph the

00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:14.499
equations as lines and find the point of intersection? Should we use

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.458
substitution to find the point of intersection? Or should we use elimination?

00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:22.633
Take some time to think about it and actually try solving it using these

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.806
different methods. You'll find out which one's best.
