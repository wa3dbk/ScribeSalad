Hi, my name is Sydney Richardson.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.939
I'm an iOS developer at Double Dutch
where we make mobile event apps.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.330
I was originally studying art and
graphic design,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.502
but I really loved math and science.

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:18.053
And when I went to college
my parents were like,

00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:21.708
why don't you study something
within engineering?

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:26.320
And my graphic design teacher encouraged
me to look into computer science.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.170
So, I took a class.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.300
Since I've been here, we've been working
on our in-app direct messaging service,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.640
where users at an event can
connect to people one on

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.150
one without having the barrier of not
having their contact information.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.430
We use Xcode, and we've been we're
writing everything in Objective-C.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.430
You face a lot of different problems,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.430
including view problems, or
API connection problems,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.189
core data, core location, and bluetooth.

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.447
But, first I looked at
Apple documents and

00:01:06.447 --> 00:01:11.708
what do i need to know before I start
coding something with core data?

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:16.280
And they'll give you
the directions to get started.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.150
If you're having a problem you can
just look it up on the Internet and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.050
someone is bound to have answered it,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.850
or someone is also going to
be in the same boat as you.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.960
I think mobile programming is a lot of
fun because you can immediately see

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.454
it on your device, or you can
immediately impact your friend or you.
