00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.609
Here's another chance to practice your loop skills. Imagine you have a friend

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:06.696
who's collecting data on climate change, and he has a data set of how much the

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:11.395
water in a reservoir rises and falls each year. If the water level rises, he

00:00:11.395 --> 00:00:16.430
records a positive number, and if it falls, he records a negative number.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.875
Starting from here, write a program that prompts the user for a value until the

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:24.961
user enters queue, and counts how many times the user enters a negative number.

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.377
If you're not sure how to start, we've linked another fact sheet with some

00:00:28.377 --> 00:00:33.770
pseudo-code for loops with different purposes. You can use it as a guide.
