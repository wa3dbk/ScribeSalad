00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.180
So to state this in logic, we first have to define what j is.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.412
And we're going to use the other the, the there exists quantifier. And

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:13.070
that's represented by a backwards facing E. So there's going to exist some

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.920
position which we're going to call j. And it's going to be greater than one.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.628
We've already taken care of the k squared's equal to one.

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:26.250
So it's going to be greater than one and it's up to, the length of Y.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.590
And what must be the case is that the value in Y of the jth position.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.430
At the jth position must be equal to the value in X at the first position.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.770
In order to make use of this we're going to then use the three

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.268
segments that we have and define. And we're going to use a recursive definition

00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:50.060
like we did before. And, but it's going to be in terms of these three segments.
