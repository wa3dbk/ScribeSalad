00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.790
The next practice is simple design. We want to avoid

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.330
creating a huge complicated possibly cumbersome design at the beginning of

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.730
the project. What we want to have instead is just

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.580
enough design to meet the requirements, so no duplicated functionality, fewest

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.910
possible classes and methods in general, just the amount of

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.860
design that we need to get our system to work. So

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.012
one might object that to for designing that way we

00:00:23.012 --> 00:00:25.210
will have to change the code a lot, we will need

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.300
to adapt the design as the code evolves,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.180
and that's exactly the point. That's what we will

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.670
do. XP is all about changing and adapting,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.850
changing your design, changing your code, refactoring. And with

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.420
the fact that we have test cases throughout

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.770
the development process, we can do that with confidence.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.220
Because if we break something we will know

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.590
right away, which leads us to the next practice.
