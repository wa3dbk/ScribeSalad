We know that for the pattern of i. It repeats after each fourth power. So for i

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:09.967
to the tenth, we would go to the cycle twice. And then we would start over. We

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:14.930
would have i, then negative 1. I to the tenth is really the same thing as i to

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.680
the sixth and i squared. They all equal negative 1. We can think of this a lot

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.220
like the arithemetic on a clock. A clock cycles every 12 hours, the hour hand

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.454
passes all the numbers, and gets to 12 and then starts over. Well, that's

00:00:30.454 --> 00:00:35.620
similar to what's happening with i, so we'll start with i and then we'll have i

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.814
squared I-cube, either the fourth, either the fifth, either the sixth, either

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:47.840
the seventh, either the eighth, either the ninth, and finally either the tenth.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.720
This is how we know either the tenth is really equal to i squared, which equals

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.250
negative 1. Our pattern repeats every four patterns of i
