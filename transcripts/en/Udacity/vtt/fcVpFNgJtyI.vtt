00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The third one is the correct answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first one wouldn't work. R2 couldn't decrypt this message

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and wouldn't know where to send the next hop.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This one would work for the first hop. R2 would decrypt it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Note to send it on to R5, but would then when R5 receives it,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it wouldn't be able to decrypt this message and know where to send it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's also unnecessary to have this extra decryption using KUR2.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This outer method has already encrypted using that public key.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Anyone who can decrypt this message can also decrypt that one,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so there's no value added by having this encryption.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The third one is the best answer.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Here we sending the message encrypted using R2's public key, so R2 can decrypt it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It has the next routing hop in plaintext in the message that R2 can decrypt.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Then it has the rest of it encrypted using R5's public key,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so R5 will be able to decrypt the next hop and learn that that should be sent on to R4.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The problem with the fourth choice--it would work for this hop,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but then when R5 decrypts it, it wouldn't know what the next hop is.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The final option wouldn't work, because R2 would get the message to send to R5

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and send the message here--which is M4.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That's encrypted using R4's public key. R5 wouldn't know where to send the message.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The only one that works is the third choice.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In general, for onion routing to work, we need each message in the chain to be the message

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that's sent to the router Rik.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's going to be a message encrypted with that router's public key.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It will have as its contents something explaining the next destination

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
as well as the message that should go to that next destination.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We can wrap as many layers as we want.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The more layers there are, the more hops we go through,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the less risk there is that all of the links in the chain can collude

00:01:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or that a party can observe all of the communication and learn what's being communicated.
