00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.130
Below is a Python implementation of a reducer for

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.460
our word count problem. Let's walk through this reducer line

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.890
by line and discuss what it's doing. First, we set

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.230
initial values for word_count and old_key to 0 and None

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.010
respectively. We take in our data which you'll recall

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.060
will be a bunch of key value pairs separated by

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.670
a tab. If we have strange row with more or

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.880
less than a key and a value, i.e., the length

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.670
of the data array is not equal to, we'll

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.390
just continue on to the next row. All of these

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.570
lines down here are essentially summing up the count

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.120
for every single key. We continue through all the key

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.340
value pairs for a particular key until we notice

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.390
that we're on to a new key. Once this happens,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.310
we print out the key and its final word count.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.392
We then set word count equal to 0 once again.

00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:54.040
You'll note that this implementation will not emit a key

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.900
value pair for our final key. Because of that, we have

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.340
to include this final bit of code down here. So

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.810
if old key is not equal to none, let's print out

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.140
one final key value paie. So, say that we ran

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.030
this reducer on all of the intermediate key value pairs our

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.504
mapper in the previous slide produced. We would go through

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:16.260
all key value pairs with the key hello. There's only one,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.220
so we emit hello, 1. There are however, 2 key value

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.610
pairs with the key my. So we would emit the final key value pair,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.450
my 2 for this key and so on. So now if

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.680
we use the mapper and reducer we just wrote

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.480
on a more significant example, say the text of

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.990
Alice in Wonderland, we can check that it works

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.620
and ensure that it produces the same type of result

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.090
as the Python script that you wrote earlier in this lesson.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.580
We're going to simulate running this map reduced job by just

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.710
running these scripts locally, using Python. Note this isn't a real

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.880
map reduced deployment, we're only running this on one computer. If

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.830
we run the script, we see that we have an output

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.115
where we have all of the words that appear in Alice

00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:04.110
in Wonderland and the number of times that each of those

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.150
words occurs. Note that all of the words are lowercase and

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.440
are stripped of all punctuation.
