00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.852
&gt;&gt; We can put them either in order from least to greatest, or greatest to least.

00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:10.723
It doesn't matter, we'll get the same results. So, let's just do least to

00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:15.993
greatest because that's more typical. So, for Nursing, the lowest salary is

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:22.675
44,640. Next is 56,380. Then, 58,350. Then, 63,120. Then finally, 72,250. So,

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:29.991
let's cross off the first and last. And again, the second to first and second to

00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:36.906
last, and we're left with this one in the middle. So, this is the median,

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:47.185
58,350. Let's do the same for the Geography majors. First, we have 38,150. Then,

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:57.055
we have 41,290. Then, 48,670. Then, 53,160. And finally, 57,320. So, again we'll

00:00:57.055 --> 00:01:03.497
cross off first and last. Second to first, second to last, and we're left with

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:04.629
one in the middle.
