00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.510
Now it's time for a question. Based on

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.200
the discussion we've had thus far, what I would

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.724
like you to think about is, coming up

00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:12.250
to the scorecard for the three different structures that

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.260
I have identified. One is the monolithic operating

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.400
system, the DOS-like structure, and the microkernel-based operating system.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.190
And what I would like you to do

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.650
is think about the features that are important in

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.870
the structure of the operating system. Extensibility,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.580
protection, performance. And try to fill out this

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.420
score card as to which of these features are adequately met by each one of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.188
these structures. So for each of these

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:46.132
operating system structures, monolithic, think about whether it

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:48.852
meets all of the features that I've identified

00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:52.030
here. Do the same thing for Dos-like structure.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.130
Do the same thing for the microkernel based structure.
