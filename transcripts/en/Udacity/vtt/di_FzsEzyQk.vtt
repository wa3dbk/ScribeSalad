Okay. Let's learn about another form element.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Instead of checkboxes, I want to use radio buttons.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So let's change the word from "checkbox" to "radio"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for these 3 inputs.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay. I've changed "checkbox" to "radio" for these 3 inputs,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
for the type="radio",

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I've left the names the same: "q", "r", and "s".

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's take a look at this in our browser.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay. Here we are in our browser, and you can see

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we have our 3 radio buttons instead of checkboxes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I can turn a Radio on by clicking on it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And if I click on a different radio button,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it also turns on.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now that's probably not the behavior you were expecting.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Normally, when we have radio buttons,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
they behave in a group.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
These ones, obviously, aren't doing that.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What happens when I click the Submit button here?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You can see that they behave, actually, just like the checkboxes do:

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
q=on, r=on, and s=on.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So these are--basically what we here are checkboxes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that you can't be unchecked--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
really convenient, right?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So now you know how radio buttons normally behave.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I should be able to select the second one and the first one should go off.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.577
How do you think we might accomplish that?
