00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.805
Here the correct answers are negative five thirds and positive one third. Great

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:08.167
work if you found these two. I know fractions aren't always the easiest to work

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:13.175
with but let's see how we got these two answers. FIrst we'll let u equal x plus

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:18.948
one. This will allow us to perform the u substitution in this step so we'll

00:00:18.948 --> 00:00:25.788
have 9 u squared mini s6 u minus 8 equals zero... Now that we have a quadratic

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:30.012
expression, we want to find factors of negative 72, the A times the C, that sum

00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:37.392
to negative 6 are B value. Those factors are negative 12 and positive 6. So, I

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:42.476
use these two to rewrite the middle term here. We use factoring by grouping to

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:48.114
get 3u plus 2 times 3u minus 4 equals to 0. We set each of these factors equal

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:52.965
to 0 so we'll have u can equal negative two thirds or u can equal positive four

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:58.586
thirds. Now if you got this far and solved for these values of u great work,

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:02.362
keep in mind though we need to solve for the values of x, the original variable

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:08.972
from our equation. We use our two solutions for u, and the fact that u equals x

00:01:08.972 --> 00:01:14.794
plus 1, to solve for the original variable x. So, we'll have x plus 1 equals

00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:21.132
negative two thirds, and we'll have x plus 1 equals to four thirds. We subtract

00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:26.248
1 from each side of the two equations to get these statements. Here, we have x

00:01:26.248 --> 00:01:31.714
equal to negative two thirds minus 1. So,since I have negative two thirds and

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:36.713
negative 1, I have negative 1 and thirds. This is the mixed number. If I change

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:41.704
it to an improper fraction, I'd have negative five thirds. For the other value

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:46.417
of x, we'll have x equals four thirds minus 1. When I subtract 1, I get to

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:51.035
choose what this 1 looks like. Since I have thirds over here, I want to make

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:56.418
sure that I subtract three thirds, a form of 1, over here. Four thirds minus

00:01:56.418 --> 00:02:01.794
three thirds equals one third, and here are our two solutions: negative five

00:02:01.794 --> 00:02:04.945
thirds and one third.
