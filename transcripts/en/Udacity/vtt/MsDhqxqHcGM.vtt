00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.200
To factor the first trinomial, we want to find factors of 30 that sum to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.910
negative 11. These factors are negative 5 and negative 6, and since our

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.450
quadratic term has a 1 in front of it, we can just use these factors in our

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.975
factored form here. X minus 5 times x minus 6. For the denominator we want to

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:21.703
find factors of 1 times 20, or 20. That sum to negative 9. Those would be

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:25.475
negative 4 and negative 5. And again since our quadratic term has a 1 as the

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:29.681
coefficient, we'll use these factors in our factored form. Great job factoring

00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:32.363
if you got one or both of those correct.
