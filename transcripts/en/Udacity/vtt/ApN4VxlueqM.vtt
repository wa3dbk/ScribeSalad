00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
And here is my solution. These are two update

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.810
lines. They’re basically identical except one

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.900
goes in one direction and the other direction.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.961
Let’s look at the first; we have an update

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.946
weight over here. We add two times our

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:14.762
new constraint with the index I minus 1. This

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:18.845
is the subtract part. We subtract I minus 2 and

00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:21.295
we subtract the original on the right side over

00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:23.912
here. It’s exactly the math I’ve given you.

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:26.492
Same over here. If you won this math , you

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.445
get this new smooth curve. I should warn you,

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.599
this can be unstable, it can give you results that

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.659
are very poor you have to adjust these parameters

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.862
very carefully and this is one of many ways to

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:36.260
smooth. There is many other ways to smooth,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.954
but the nice thing that you achieve here is that

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:41.259
you get actually smooth two points that they

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:42.902
are holding fixed, which is actually

00:00:42.902 --> 00:00:46.000
really, really useful.
