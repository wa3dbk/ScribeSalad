00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.401
Our next psychotherapy is based on the principles of operant and classical

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:08.770
conditioning, and that's behavioral treatments. Behavioral treatments are used

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.390
to treat a variety of disorders, from autism to ADHD, drug addiction, anxiety,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.585
depression, phobias, even schizophrenia and intellectual disabilities.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.623
&gt;&gt; And because this is Susan's area of expertise, I'm going to pass it over to her

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.372
for a little bit.

00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:28.272
&gt;&gt; The first published study to demonstrate the use of behavioral principles in

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:32.232
treating psychological disorders was published in 1959 by Teodoro Ayllon and

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:39.260
Jack Michael, and it was titled The Psychiatric Nurse as a Behavioral Engineer.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.320
Now, Jack Michael was actually on my masters and Ph.D committees, and he

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.686
continues to contribute important work in the field of behavior analysis, and

00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:49.103
that includes both the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:55.080
analysis. Now in this particular study, they demonstrated how you could use

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.564
Skinner's operant conditioning principles to decrease the symptoms of mental

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:03.601
disorders. In addition, this was the first study that actually started the

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:08.440
field of applied behavior analysis. So, let's look at ABA in more detail.
