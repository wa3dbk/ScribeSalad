We're getting pretty close to the end of this class, so congratulations on making it this far.

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:07.309
Now one of the most challenging skills in all of GPU computing.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.445
is trying to parallelize a problem that you've never seen before,

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:15.016
so what we're going to do today is look at several examples of interesting applications where we've done that.

00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:19.379
Hopefully this is going to give you a few more tools in your GPU computing toolbox.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.899
So let's get started.
