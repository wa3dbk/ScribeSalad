00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.120
So far we have focused mainly on reading data. But what

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.302
happens when we want to write to memory? Here we'll consider

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:09.072
a single core system. I'll refer you to an architecture class

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:12.140
for a shared memory system where keeping a cache consistent becomes a

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.650
challenge. We need to consider both what happens on a hit

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.580
when the block we want to write to is already in

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.470
the cache. And what happens on a miss, when it isn't.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.394
On a hit, the most obvious thing to do is to write-through

00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:29.290
to memory. That is, we'll write to the cache, and then

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.930
also write to the main memory to copy the data, and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.140
keep the cache and main memory consistent. As long as I

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.730
don't have to worry about some other entity needing an updated

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.170
version from memory however, there's actually no need to write everything

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.010
this instant. This is the insight behind the write-back policy which

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.610
only writes to the cache. After all, that's where we'll look

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.530
first if the same processor tries to read the data or

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.300
write to it later. Only when the cache block gets

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.110
evicted sometime later does the data really need to be

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.640
written to main memory. And then it'll be the whole

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.670
cache block. This lazy approach can be beneficial when the same

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.870
cache block is written to many times before [INAUDIBLE]. For

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.745
cache misses we also have two strategies. The first is

00:01:10.745 --> 00:01:13.930
write-allocate, which first reads the current value in memory into

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.120
the cache. Then it behaves as though it were a hit,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.630
using either of the two hit strategies. Lastly we have

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.830
the no-write allocate policy, where we just write the data

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.300
to memory and don't bother with the cache at all.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.300
The interactions among these policies can be subtle, particularly when

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.020
there are multiple cache levels. It is worth pointing out

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.590
however, that some of these policies share certain assumptions, and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.270
are therefore often paired together. The write back policy is

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.360
betting that there will be subsequent writes to the same

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.050
cache block. That's why he is bundling up all the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.900
changes he is making for one trip to memory, when the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.660
block gets evicted. Write allocate is also betting on subsequent

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.030
writes to the same block. That's why he loads the data

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.530
up into the cache. On the other hand, write-through is

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.590
betting on the cache block being evicted sooner rather than later.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.840
He does his writes to memory up front, so that

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.530
he can quickly evict the cap block from the cache later

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.620
if he has to, not having to worry about any

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.790
writes to the disk. Similarly, the no-write allocate policy is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.360
also betting on that same cached block not being used

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.820
again soon. It doesn't even bring the data into the cache.
