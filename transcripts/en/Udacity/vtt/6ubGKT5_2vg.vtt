00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.649
We've been talking a lot about equations that are in the form, y equals mx plus

00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:09.348
b. And we've talked about how m here represents the slope of this line, and b is

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.988
the y-coordinate of the y-intercept, the place where the graph intersects the

00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:18.423
y-axis. When we write an equation in this form, we say that it is written in

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:23.133
slope-intercept form. Since, as we've seen, this let's us just read off the

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:27.771
values of the slope and the y-intercept. Understanding the rule that each of

00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:32.165
these constants play in this equation and its graph, can help us get to the

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:36.904
stage of graphing a lot quicker. Let's see if we can figure out how to graph the

00:00:36.916 --> 00:00:41.335
equation y equals negative 2x plus 10 without creating an xy table first. Let's

00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:46.034
just move straight to the graph. Of course, we have to start by setting up our x

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.948
and y axes. Notice here that the scale on either axis is different.

00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:54.208
Horizontally, we're counting by ones with each grid but vertically, we're

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.527
counting by fours. I just want to make sure we have enough room to show as much

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.687
of this line as I want to. One pretty easy way for us to start out would be by

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.711
filling in a point that we can find out super easily. So, please begin by

00:01:06.723 --> 00:01:11.051
telling me where the y-intercept of this equation is. Please don't forget that

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:15.380
the y-intercept is actually a point, a set of coordinates, not just one number.
