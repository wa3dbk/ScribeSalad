00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.560
We can think of diagnosis as a mapping from a data space, to a hypothesis space,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.220
In case of a medical diagnosis, the data may be the greatest kind of signs and

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.080
symptoms that I may go to a doctor with. Some of the data may be very specific,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.830
some of it may be very abstract, an example of a very

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.540
specific data is that a [UNKNOWN] temperature is 104 degrees fahrenheit.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.861
An example of the extraction of the data is that [INAUDIBLE] is running a fever.

00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.480
The hypothesis space consists of all hypothesis that can explain parts of

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.600
the observed data. A hypothesis in the hypothesis space can explain some part of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.840
the data, In case of medicine, this hypothesis may reference to diseases.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.220
A doctor may say that my hypothesis is that a shook is suffering from flu, and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.100
that explains his high fever. In the domain of car repairs,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.450
this hypothesis may refer to specific faults with the car, for example,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.210
the carburetor is not working properly. In the domain of computer software,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.950
this hypothesis may refer to specific methods not working properly.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.470
And this mapping from data space to the hypothesis space can be very complex.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.250
The complexity arises partly because of the size of data space, partly because

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.690
of the size of hypothesis space, partly because the mapping can be M to N. And

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.520
also, because this hypothesis can interact with each other, If H3 is present,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.450
H4 may be excluded, If H5 is present, H6 is sure to be present and so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.450
on. It helps then not to deal with all the raw data, but

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.910
to deal with abstractions of the data, so the initial data that a patient may

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.230
go to a doctor with may be very, very specific. The signs and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.200
symptoms of their particular specific patient, but the diagnostic process might

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.910
abstract them from Asok has a fever of 104 degrees farenheit to Asok has

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.780
a high fever. This abstract data that can be mapped into an abstract hypothesis,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.160
Asok has high fever can get mapped into Asok has a bladder infection for

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.888
example. The abstract hypothesis can now be refined into a suffering from flu or

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:06.060
a flu for a particular screen. At the end,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.070
we want a hypothesis that is as refined as possible, and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.600
that explains all the available data. When we were talking about classification,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.880
we talked about two processes of classification, bottom-up process and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.070
our top down process. The bottom up process of classification, we started with

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.050
raw data and then grouped and abstracted, it in case of top down classification

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.550
we started with some high level class and then established it and refined it.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.840
You can see that in diagnosis both the bottom up process of classification, and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.920
the tope down process of classification are co-occurring.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.930
This method of bottom up classification and data space, mapping and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.640
hypothesis space, and then top down classification of hypothesis space is called

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.219
heuristic classification. This is yet another method like rule-based reasoning,

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.700
case-based reasoning, and model-based reasoning with a diagnostic task.
