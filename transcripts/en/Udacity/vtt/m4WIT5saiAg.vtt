00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.868
Let's add stack views to Pitch Perfect.

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:07.580
Open the storyboard file and navigate to
our place sound view controller scene.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.170
Let's start by changing the background
of the view back to white.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.260
Select the view in the document outline,
and

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.680
then, in the attributes inspector,
select white as the background color.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.780
Okay, now to add the stack views.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.210
In Pitch Perfect, we're going to have
a vertical stack view as the base

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.170
with horizontal stack views
embedded inside of it.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.240
Make sure the object library is
open here, on the bottom right, and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.960
put in the word stack
into the search box.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.570
You should see horizontal and
vertical stack views.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.640
Drag a vertical stack
view onto the view.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.340
You should see it underneath
the view in the document outline,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.420
here on the left side.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.746
Drag diagonally from the vertical
stack view back to the view.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:51.340
With the shift-key held down,
select Leading Space to Container,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.850
Trailing Space to Container,
Vertical Spacing to Top Layout guide,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.720
Vertical Spacing to Bottom Layout
guide and select Add Constraints.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.200
This will add the constraints we need,
but

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.630
the stack field is still the wrong size.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.380
The reason is that Xcode has put
in constants in the constraints

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.240
to keep the stack view at
the size you see here.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.810
We really should move those and
make it the same size as the view.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.340
To do that,
go into each of the four constraints and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.680
set the constant to zero.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.380
As you do this, you'll notice that the
stack view will start to look correctly.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.300
Once you finish setting all the
constants to zero, the stack view will

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.420
be the same size as the view for
our play sounds view controller.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.490
Let's make sure the main vertical
stack view has the correct fill and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.520
distribution properties.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.944
Select a vertical stack view
from the document outline.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.530
In the attributes inspector, choose Fill
for the Alignment, and Fill Equally for

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.200
the Distribution.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.580
Make sure spacing is set
to zero as you see here.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.910
For this next step, Xcode is going to
display a few auto layout warnings while

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.780
we drag the new stack
view onto our scene.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.460
Don't be alarmed, the warnings will be
there while the stack view's empty.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.728
Once we had buttons to it, the stack
view will know how to size itself and

00:02:02.728 --> 00:02:04.330
the outer layout
warnings will disappear.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.720
&gt;From the object library,
search for the word stack,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.950
drag a horizontal stack view
underneath a vertical stack view.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.566
Select the horizontal stack view, and
in the attributes inspector make sure

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:20.740
alignment is set to Fill, and
distribution is set to Fill Equally.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.620
In the next step,
we're going to add the buttons for

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.650
slow and fast audio playback.
