00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.978
Our polynomial is in the form ax squared plus bx plus c. We multiply the a and c

00:00:05.978 --> 00:00:11.270
together to get 12. This is the top number. This number will always come from

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.892
the product of the coefficient of the x squared term and our constant. The b or

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:21.730
the bottom number comes from our x term, the 13. Great work if you put 12 and

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.067
13.
