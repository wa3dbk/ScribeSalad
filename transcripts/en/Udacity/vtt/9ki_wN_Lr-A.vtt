00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.032
Here are the values for a, b and c that we found in the last quiz, and now I'd

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:08.167
like you to use these values in the quadratic formula. On your own piece of

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:12.457
paper, please write in these values in the proper places and then simplify, so

00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:16.219
that you can write a single number in each of these boxes right here.
