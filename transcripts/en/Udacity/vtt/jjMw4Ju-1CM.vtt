00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.450
Okay, so let's talk a little bit more about

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.019
why we would use MongoDB. One of the most important

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.800
reasons to use MongoDB is because it has a flexible

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.680
schema. This enables us to more easily handle data in

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.140
flat formats, such as CSV, and also hierarchical data, where

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.640
individual fields Are composed of multiple elements. MongoDB is also

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.980
oriented toward programmers. One way we see this is that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.240
the type of JSON documents stored in MongoDB map directly

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.840
onto familiar data types found in most popular

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.180
programming languages. Such as the examples we saw; php

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.480
arrays, Python dictionaries, etcetera. Another place we see this

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.300
is in the MongoDB Client Libraries, or drivers as

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.480
we call them. MongoDB supports drivers for most popular

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.100
programming languages. These drivers handle the job of translating

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.670
the data to and from native data types within

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.380
the particular language as needed by the application, and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.170
also support a number of other features That make

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.110
it easy to develop applications using MongoDB. Another feature

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.830
that makes MongoDB great for data scientists is your

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.150
ability to deploy MongoDB in a variety of ways.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.780
So for example in just a couple of minutes

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.400
you can download install and run MongoDB on your

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.330
laptop and quickly begin developing an application on your

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.480
laptop. Or you can deploy MongoDB on multiple servers.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.500
With several demons running to support a big data application. And,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.460
of course, there are lots of options in between these two.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.750
MongoDB is designed for big data. It's highly scalable horizontally, on

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.170
commodity hardware, and includes native support for Map Reduce. And it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.190
includes the aggregation framework. That

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.300
enables efficient analytics applications. Okay so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.910
enough chatter about MongoDB, let's dive in and actually start using it.
