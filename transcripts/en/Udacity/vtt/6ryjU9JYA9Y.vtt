00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.266
Now Athena is well equipped to answer Grant's question. How many break even

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:09.140
points are there? Remember, a break even point is just a point on the graph,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.904
where profit or P of x equals 0. Please fill in the number of those spots right

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:18.160
here. Then, please tell me what the value of x is at each of these break even

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.801
points. Separate your answers by commas.
