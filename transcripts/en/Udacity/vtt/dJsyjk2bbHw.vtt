00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, you always start with a, because you can get a

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
by looking at the case of x equals 0 and then b doesn't matter.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So if x equals 0, so it means you write over here, then y equals a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that falls us directly from this question because x equals 0.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So what's the y value over here? It's 1 so that means a is to be 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now that we know this, you can look at b.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We know that if x = 4 then the expression on the right over here gets us a 2 in the y dimension.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We really know a is you can put the a in which gives us 4b+1=2. We bring 1 to the right side.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Therefore, 4b=1 and then we divided by 4, which means b equals to fourth or quarter

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and 0.25 and 1 other correct answers here.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So now you understand about lines. Let's talk about linear regression.
