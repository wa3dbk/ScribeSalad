00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.710
As we talked about computational photography, let's not forget the most basic

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.480
element of computational photography is still a camera, camera like this one.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.310
This was actually built in the,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.880
about the mid-1950s, and was given to my father by his father.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.170
And I was lucky enough to get it from my father recently.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.310
This was the first camera I ever used to take my first ever picture.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.570
The bottom line with all cameras is they're still the same in principle.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.000
What they do is they capture rays of light and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.690
get it to a sensor, which can be a digital sensor or film.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.150
And that pipeline is then used to create a photograph.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.030
In this lecture we will talk about that pipeline.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.820
How rays of light are brought onto a sensor to generate a picture.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.050
The most basic example of that camera is a pinhole camera.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.680
And the concept of pinhole photography was known even in the early 300 BC.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.540
But, in about the early 1800s, that was converted into creating cameras.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.840
And from there on, a lot more efforts went into building optics and

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.330
lenses that were then used to create better cameras.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.560
In this lecture we'll talk about the pinhole camera.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.300
And we'll talk about the use of lenses to actually get the right kinds of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.060
rays of light to the right location, so we can actually store images.
