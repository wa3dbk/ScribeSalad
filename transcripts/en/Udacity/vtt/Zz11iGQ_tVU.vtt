00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.020
&gt;From what we just discussed, you learn that an increase of 3 decibels doubles

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.780
the power of sound. So, this gives us some context for thinking about what a

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.380
decibel means, in general. Now, it's been found that after about 8 hours of

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.740
exposure to 85 decibel noise, you can experience permanent hearing damage. So,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.710
this is just an example, but every time the sound power doubles, the exposure

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.280
time before hearing damage occurs halves. I wonder then how long it would take

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.485
for you to experience permanent hearing damage, if instead of 85 decibels a

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:41.760
sound was 100 decibels. Let's start off simple. What's the increase in decibels

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.831
from 85 decibels to 100 decibels?
