00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's do an example to figure out how to do generalization.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What do we generalize over?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, we generalize over problems.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we're going to need another problem.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Rather than have a problem dealing with costs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which we saw were complicated ,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
let's just do a problem where we're finding the shortest path.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is, the least number of steps to a solution.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm going to choose a classic problem called the "missionaries and cannibals" problem.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It works like this: there's a river we have to cross, similar to the bridge but this time it's a river.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We've got a boat, and on this side of the river, there are 6 people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
No flashlight, but a boat and 6 people.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Three of these people are missionaries,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and three are cannibals.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The goal is to get everybody over to the other side.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What makes it hard is that there are two rules.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
One, at most 2 in the boat.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
One person can go in the boat and cross from one side to the other,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but it takes either 1 or 2 people to get the boat from one side and to get it back.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The other rule is that we don't want the cannibals eating the missionaries.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If we leave more cannibals that missionaries on either side of the river--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
either on this side or over on this side--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
then the cannibals are going to gang up and eat the missionaries,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we won't be able to accomplish getting everybody across.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We have to shuttle them back in forth in such a way that this never occurs.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now, let's try to come up with a good representation for state.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
One possibility would be to have a set of missionaries,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a set of cannibals, and a boat--let's call that a Boolean, yes or no,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
saying what's on the starting side

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and leaving out what's on the other side, because we can figure that out.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Given that we know we three missionaries,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If there's a set of 2 on one side then the other side there must be 1.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Another possibility is that we have 3 integers:

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
the number of missionaries, the number of cannibals, and the number of boats

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that are on the starting side. These are all integers.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then the third possibility is that we have 6 numbers:

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the number of missionaries, cannibals, and boats on the first side,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and the number of each of those on the other side.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It may be subjective which of these is best, but I want you to tell me

00:02:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which of these would sufficient for representing the state.
