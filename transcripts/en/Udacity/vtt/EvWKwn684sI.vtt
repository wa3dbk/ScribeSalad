00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.310
So let's look at another feature that is needed

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.570
to build scalable applications, task queues. So why do

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.370
we need task queues? Well at this time this

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.080
picture should be no surprise to you. Our dear

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.500
users accessing our application from various devices. And our

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.330
application for turning the response. Technically this response must

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.390
be returned within 60 seconds from the request. But

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.340
that's a long time. We've talked about the importance

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.800
about returning a response as quickly as possible to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.050
our dear users. And we don't want them to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.260
wait, even for seconds, right? And certainly not 60

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.510
seconds. You want to deliver that response as quickly as

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.870
possible. But let's say that the user activity triggers

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.340
something big to happen. For example, the user adds a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.720
new conference and as a consequence of that 10,000

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.510
emails should be sent out to notify other users about

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.650
this conference. First of all, that's not possible within

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.340
60 seconds. And secondly, you certainly don't want the

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.960
poor user that just registered the conference to wait

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.550
for this to happen. Remember, the screen update depends on

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.340
your response so even seconds are crucial to keep

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.790
your application responsive. Come to the rescue are task

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.510
queues. This is exactly the problem task queues solve.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.590
And it may not be emails triggering the need for

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.700
this, it could be something else. For example, an

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.300
image needs to be analyzed or a video needs to

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.800
be re-encoded. Many things that are not needed to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.840
complete the request for the user, could use task queues
