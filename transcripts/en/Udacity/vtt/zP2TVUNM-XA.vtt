00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.870
Now that the user had logged in to

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.510
a client work station, Venus will establish an

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.670
RPC session, on behalf of the client. And

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.590
in order to establish the RPC session, the

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.700
following message exchange is going to happen. And this

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.500
is what is called the bind operation between

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.490
the client and the server. So what Venus

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.710
is going to do is send the client identity and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.990
an encrypted cipher. The client identity, as I mentioned earlier, in

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.220
private keycryptal systems, you have to send it in clear text so that the server

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.210
knows the identity of the client and in order to establish a new

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.390
RPC session, Venus will use the secret token as the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.800
client identity. And it will use the HKC, the handshake

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.560
key for the client that was contained in the clear token data structure

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.530
that was given back to the work station by the server as part of executing

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.815
the log in process. That is the key that will be used for encrypting

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:11.589
the starting message for the RPC session

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:16.450
establishment. Now what exactly is the massage that

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.140
is being sent. Well all there is sent for initiating this RPC session

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.850
establishment, is a random number which is new for each RPC session that Venus

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.300
is establishing on behalf of this client. Every time it wants to establish a new

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.100
RPC session within a login session, it creates a new random number and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.775
encrypts it using the handshake key. That's

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:48.700
the cipher text. And the secret token

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.530
is the client ID, and that's the message that goes from virtue to vice, the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.980
server. So when this message arrives at the server, how will the server decrypt

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.190
this message? Well, the client ID is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.640
the secret token. Recall that the secret token

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.430
is nothing but an encryption of the clear token,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.770
with a key that is known only to the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.380
server, and therefore, what the server can do is

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.660
take the secret token, decrypt it using the key that

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.850
it has and once it decrypts it, it gets

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.600
this clear token data structure and from the clear token

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.070
data structure, it can say well what is the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.210
key that is contained in this clear token data structure,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.030
take the key and decrypt this message. Cause, that key is HKC, and that

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.330
is how the server can get the message that has been sent as the initiation

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.580
of the RPC session. So in particular, what the server has gotten now is

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.440
the random number that was sent to it by Venus Xr. Now what the server does,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.550
is it takes this random number, increments it by 1, and also adds a new random

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.470
number, Yr, and that is a message that it is going to send back to the client.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.370
It has to encrypt this message of course,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.780
because its going on the wire, which is insecure.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.010
So it's going to encrypt it using a

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.010
key, a handshake key which we'll call HKS and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.650
by design, HKC and HKS are exactly the same. So in other words, whatever is the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.380
handshake key that has been given to the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.550
client in the clear token, is the same handshake

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.010
key that the server is going to use

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.570
to communicate information back to the client as

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.236
well. So, it encrypts this message with this

00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:50.540
handshake key and sends it over to the client.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.630
So what is the purpose of this message?

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.430
When this message comes over to the client,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.850
the client can decrypt this message. How? It's

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.310
going to use HKC which is the handshake key

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.540
that it knows will be used by a genuine server to encode the message and send it

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.340
to the client, and so it can use

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.580
HKC to decrypt this message and once it decrypts

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.730
this message, it gets these two numbers. There's Xr

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.460
plus 1, that is the original random number that this guy sent over to the server

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.690
incremented by 1. Now what is the purpose served by this

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.840
number, Xr plus 1. It actually establishes to the client that the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.000
server is genuine. Anybody could replay a message

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.040
that they see on the wire, but for this message to have the right content, what

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.860
the client is expecting is that the response that the client is going to get for

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.990
the original message that was initiating the RPC

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.970
session. is that the response from the server

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.790
is going to contain a number that is 1

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.500
greater than the random number that it sent

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.164
the server in the first place. So, if this number, Xr plus 1, is what the

00:05:11.164 --> 00:05:15.212
client was expecting, then it establishes that the

00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:19.040
server is genuine. So this goes back to

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.790
what I said about authentication of the server.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.774
That is one of the challenges that the

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:27.300
[INAUDIBLE] system has. This is the way the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.360
virtue workstation, the Venus process on the virtue workstation

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.180
on behalf of the client can establish the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.720
genuineness of the server that this workstation is talking

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.500
to. Or in other words, it's not a

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.050
Trojan Horse that is sending this message. But it

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.680
is genuine server that is sending this message

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.640
because this field is exactly what Venus expected it

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.260
to be. Now what is this number? This is

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.600
another random number that the server is sending as

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.790
part of this message. Why is it sending

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.530
this random number? It'll become clear in the

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.350
next set of communication that's going on between

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.200
Venus and Vice. Now once Venus has extracted

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.100
this Yr from this message, what it is going to do is it is

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.110
going to increment it by 1 and take that as a message, Yr plus 1, as a message,

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.480
encrypt it using the handshake key, and send

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.490
it over to this server. And when the

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.745
server decrypts this message and extracts this field,

00:06:32.745 --> 00:06:37.900
it'll see whether this field is what it

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.702
is expecting it to be. What the server is expecting is that this will be Yr

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:45.295
plus 1. And if the client is genuine,

00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:48.470
then the client would've been able to extract Yr

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:54.390
from this response that came from the server and generate Yr plus 1

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.450
and send it over to the server. So in other words, this message coming to the

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.040
server is establishing the genuineness of the

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.080
client, because this original message that we

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.700
saw could have been just a replay,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.640
meaning somebody sniffed the network, got a hold

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.260
of this packet, and replayed it. But if

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.840
they replayed it, then they would not have the

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.780
key, and they would not have been able

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.460
to decrypt this message. So the fact that the

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.270
client was able to decrypt this message, extract

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.790
Yr increment it and send a new message that

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.280
contains Yr plus 1 to the server is

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.350
authenticating to the server that the client is genuine.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.760
Just as this message established to the

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.450
client that the server is genuine, similarly, this

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.340
message coming from the client to the

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.210
server is establishing to the server that the

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.000
client is genuine. And this pair of

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.010
communication that you are seeing is also avoiding

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.460
replay attack either from the client to the

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.200
server or from the server to the client.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.680
In both directions, we're avoiding it by

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.530
this trick of generating a new random number.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.850
For establishing an RPC session and communicating it

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.990
back and forth between the client and server.
