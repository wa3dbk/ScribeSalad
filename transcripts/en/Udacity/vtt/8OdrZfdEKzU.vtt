00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.807
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Try solving this mixture problem. You have 10 liters of a chemical mixture

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:07.527
that is 8% water, and you want to add to that a mixture that is 15% water to get

00:00:07.527 --> 00:00:11.445
a mixture that's 10% water. How much of the 15% mixture should you use? One

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:15.867
thing that you should notice in mixture problems is that the percentage of your

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:20.290
final mixture must be in between the percentage of the other two mixtures. The

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.853
10% falls in between the 8% mixture and the 15% mixture. This makes sense

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:29.746
because we can only come up with the percentage that would be between these two.

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:34.044
I couldn't make a 60% solution from an 8% water solution and a 15% water

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:37.250
solution because, well, these two would be too low.
