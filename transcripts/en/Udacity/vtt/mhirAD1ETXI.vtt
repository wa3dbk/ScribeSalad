00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.770
We've looked at how routes
pair with templates and

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.310
what dynamic segments are in a route.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.320
Let's take what we've learned and
start building out our app.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.600
Wait a minute!

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.570
Remember, we don't want
to create routes and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.490
template files by hands,
we're too lazy for that.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.010
We'll use Ember CLI to create
everything for us instead.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.020
Let's generate a route that will handle
things when the URL is slash menu.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.470
So we'll use Ember's generate command,
but

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.020
remember that generate
has an alias of just g.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.540
So I'll use that since it's shorter,
and we want to generate a route.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.850
And we want that route
to match the URL menu.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.380
This commanded a number of things for
us.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.220
We'll skip these first two for
a second and come back to them.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.040
Notice that the generate command we
just ran modified the router file and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.490
added this line here.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.259
This menu route we'll call
the menu.js route file and

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:55.330
then load the menu.jshbs template.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.960
It also created a file for testing.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.690
This is why Ember CLI is so
incredibly awesome.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.550
It did all this force
with just one command.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.240
So the generate command added
just this line to the router.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.980
This menu route, loads the menu routes
file, then it loads the menu template.

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:18.760
We'll come back and look at these files
in detail soon, but first let's add some

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.840
content to the template file so
we can see something in the browser.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.230
I've added this HTML here
with headings and images for

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.710
a few menu items, I've also included
the image files and a bit of CSS.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.240
Back in the browser,
we don't really see anything.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.247
Hm, when working with routes and
templates,

00:01:34.247 --> 00:01:37.360
make sure you're actually
loading the correct route.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.630
Adding menu shows us the template.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.130
Awesome.
