00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.067
What we just described is termed self serving bias. And a self serving bias is

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:08.772
when we have the tendency to make situational attributions for our failures,

00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:14.088
and dispositional attributions for our successes. And the reason we asked you

00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:18.120
to pay so close attention to this attribution theory is because of this self

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.053
serving bias. Now, when I first started teaching psychology and covered this

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:26.113
topic, I was actually quite surprised by how often I used dispositional

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:31.553
attributions to explain other people's behavior. And now that I'm aware of it,

00:00:31.553 --> 00:00:36.315
I try to first look at perhaps situational attributions. For example, if my

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:39.707
friend doesn't call me back, I try to look at perhaps reasons such as her phone

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:42.887
is dead, or maybe she's on the phone with her boyfriend, or she had to work

00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:46.332
late, instead of using a dispositional attribution and saying perhaps she's

00:00:46.332 --> 00:00:52.550
lazy or selfish. Can you think of any times in your life when you've used a

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.720
situational attribution instead of a dispositional one, or vice versa?
