00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.700
In cycle 5, two things will happen. One, this instruction will write its result.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.720
And two, I'll try to issue the next instruction if I can.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.190
We can do that in either or. Let's say that we do the issuing first this time.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.065
This is a subtract in ROB5, writing to R4. R1 and R5 are ROB4 and

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:26.150
3. So I write the value of 3 here, and ROB4 here. And then,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.520
what I do is I mark that Register 4 is from now on going to be pointing to ROB5,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.710
because that's where I put this instruction. I have issued this instruction in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.710
cycle 5. And with that, I have completed the issue of this instruction, but

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.560
it is not ready to execute because it still has one of its operands,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.470
is not available and we need to wait for it. Another thing again that happens in

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.550
cycle 5 is that we need to take care of the writing of the result for

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.185
the ROB3 instruction. So what happens is, this instruction writes the result of

00:00:55.185 --> 00:01:00.850
3, with a tab of ROB3. Now this 3 is really written here and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.440
the instruction is marked as done. Also, the value of 3 is broadcast under

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.009
the name of ROB3, so that the reservation stations can try to capture it. So

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.632
what's going to happen is there is a match here. This one is waiting for ROB 3.

00:01:13.632 --> 00:01:19.480
It's going to capture a value of 3 and no longer wait for ROB 3. So this

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.310
is what happens in cycle 5, as far as broadcasting of this result is concerned.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.550
Note that the RAT and everything is not updated yet. That will happen at commit.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.330
So now, in cycle 5, we have finished our issuing here,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.680
we have broadcast our result, we are ready to move on to cycle 6.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.730
Neither of these instructions is ready to actually dispatch in cycle 5, so

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.370
nothing will begin executing in cycle 6 because both of them still wait for

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.770
something else. So in cycle 6, what happens is, as far as issuing is concerned,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.650
we're going to try to issue this instruction. As far as execution is concerned,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.690
these two cannot still execute because they're still waiting for

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.488
something. As far as writing of results is concerned,

00:01:57.488 --> 00:02:03.150
the instruction 3 has finished writing the result and has been marked as done.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.540
These two still have a while to go before they're going to write their results.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.758
Because we're in cycle 6, the next thing here is going to happen in cycle 13.

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:13.280
So in cycle 6, pretty much the only thing that happens is

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.150
these two instructions continue to execute and we try to issue an instruction.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.210
We're going to issue this one by grabbing a reservation station and a ROB entry.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.540
We're going to be writing to R1. We are now named ROB6. R4 and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.450
R2 are coming from ROB5 and ROB1, so neither of those is available yet.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.510
And then, we're going to mark that R1 from now on is pointing to ROB6.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.990
So with this we have issued this instruction.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.500
Now, we have written the result of this instruction, so technically this

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.580
instruction by itself could commit in cycle 6. However, remember that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.097
an instruction cannot commit until all previous instructions have committed. So

00:02:55.097 --> 00:02:58.785
all of this instruction would commit in 6 if everything else was committed

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:03.770
already. It will actually not commit until at least cycle 43 or 4 or 5. So

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.450
pretty much, this instruction sits here as done. Others can use its result but

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.370
it cannot really commit until we commit the instructions 1 and 2. So in cycle 6,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.940
this is all that happens. There is no commit here. And now we move to cycles 7,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.200
in which case, we have nothing to issue anymore, so issuing will not be an issue

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.390
anymore. We cannot execute anything until we see some results being broadcast.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.880
So, really, the next cycle when something interesting will happen, is cycle 13,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.700
in which, we will have another write of our results.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.090
So let's just kind of fast forward through to that.
