00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.405
So okay, ping is pretty simple, but
how do you think traceroute works?

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:08.330
I'm not going to make this a quiz
because it really is pretty tricky.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.376
The ability to trace out packet paths
wasn't intentionally built into

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:13.866
the Internet protocols.

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:17.726
Rather, a clever engineer named
Van Jacobson discovered that a safety

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:21.454
feature that was made to prevent
infinite loops made it possible to do

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.626
traceroute as well.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:25.705
Here's the safety feature
traceroute makes use of.

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:30.769
Every packet has a time to live or
TTL field, which starts at

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.165
some large number and is reduced by one
each time that packet hits a router.

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:39.410
As it moves through the network,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.816
each router reduces the TTL on
the packet by one as it passes it on,

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:47.446
all the way until it finally
gets to its destination.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:50.668
This means that if routers
are misconfigured so

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:55.660
that packets flow around in an infinite
loop, eventually the time to live

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.297
on each packet will drop to zero,
and it will expire.

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:04.254
This helps keep momentary loops from
crashing large parts of the network with

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:05.867
an overload of traffic.

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:10.386
When a packet's TTL expires,
the router that last received it,

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:14.997
sends a tiny error message back
to the packet's original sender.

00:01:14.997 --> 00:01:18.770
And that message says that
the packet's TTL expired, and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.625
it gives the address of the router
that saw that packet die.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.997
So given that idea, now can you
think of how traceroute might work?

00:01:26.997 --> 00:01:31.144
The TTL mechanism means that if
a program sends a packet with TTL0,

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:35.387
it will be immediately killed, and
an error message will come back.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:40.373
If it sends a packet with TTL1, it'll
go one hop, land on the first router,

00:01:40.373 --> 00:01:44.394
get decremented to 0, killed,
and an error will come back.

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:49.306
Then with TTL2, it'll go two hops to
the destination before it gets killed.

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:54.112
So sending packets to a destination with
progressively increasing TTLs starting

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:57.524
at one, the traceroute program
gets an error message back

00:01:57.524 --> 00:02:00.396
from each router on the way
to that destination.

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:03.981
And it can use those error messages
to reconstruct the path which is

00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:07.181
just the list of those routers
in order that a packet takes to

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.600
get to that destination.
