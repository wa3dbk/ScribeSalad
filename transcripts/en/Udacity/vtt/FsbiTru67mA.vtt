Alright, so next we're going to look at some recursively generated graphs.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We start off with a set of n nodes,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
then we create a graph on half of the nodes recursively.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We create a graph on the other half of the nodes recursively.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Then we generate some edges that connect up between these two smaller graphs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that's the graph that we return.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So, we can get a bunch of different mechanisms

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for generating recursive graphs with this basic structure,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
depending on how we create the 1st sub graph,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
how we create the 2nd sub graph,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and how we connect the two sub graphs together.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, let's start off with a really simple example.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, here is some pseudo Python for generating a graph with n nodes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What's it's going to do is--to make a graph with n nodes--if n is just 1,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
it returns a single node all by itself.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But if it's not, we're going to assume it's some other power of 2.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We make a graph with n/2 nodes, call it G1.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We make a another graph with n/2 nodes, call it G2.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Then we pick a random node from G1, call it i1, a random node from G2, call it i2,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and we link them together.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So, at a high level, create graph G1, create graph G2.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We pick a random node i1, pick another random node i2,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and we link them together.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now, in this picture it's not really clear what's going on inside of these.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What I'd like you to do is figure it out.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So, maybe take n to be some small power of 2, like 4 or 8

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and trace through this pseudo code to try to figure out what kind of graph pops out.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So, here are three choices to choose from what we get out.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Is it a tree, is it a chain or is it a ring?
