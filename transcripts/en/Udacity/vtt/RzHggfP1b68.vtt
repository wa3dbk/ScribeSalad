00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.056
For the CarShareApp, we crated four classes. There was the CarShareApp, which

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:10.693
used the simulation, which used cars and persons. The simulation and car

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:16.180
classes go together and are specific to the CarShareApp. The person is more

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.970
general and could possibly be used for other situations. These three classes

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.810
could be organized into packages. The person class might go into a more

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.866
general, com.udacity package, and the simulation and car, would go in a more

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:36.280
specific, carshare package. The CarShareApp, is just a main program, that we're

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.456
writing that uses these other things, so we'll keep it in the default package.

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:44.506
Creating packages in BlueJ is a little bit funny, so I'll show you how to do

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:50.094
this. From the car share project. I'm going to look up at the menu. It's at the

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:55.186
upper left for me, but it might be right along this bar for you. I'll go to

00:00:55.186 --> 00:01:01.391
Edit&gt; New Package, and then put in the package name. Com.udacity.carshare. Now

00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:08.730
the package appears here in Bluejay. I can open it up. This is the com package.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.020
This is the Udacity package and this is the Car-share package in the Car-share

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.681
package I want to put the car in simulation classes. So to do that i will go to

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:22.776
that Edit menu again and then I select Add Classroom file and then inside the

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:29.355
folder that contains all of the Car-share I'll select the car and add it. Now

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:33.427
the car shows up in the Car-share package. But I need to add the simulation

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:40.375
too. Edit &gt; Add Classroom File &gt; Simulation &gt; Add. Now in the Udacity package I

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:45.792
want to add the person. Edit &gt; Add Classroom File and this time I'll select

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:51.036
Person. And now its here, so this compiles but if I go back to the Car-share

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:57.062
package and try to compile these or find cannot find symbol class. That's

00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:01.271
because person is no longer right beside simulation so i have to tell Java

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:07.474
where to look for the person class. Where do I look for the person class? In

00:02:07.474 --> 00:02:13.580
com.udacity. Now before I ask you a question, I've got one more clean up task.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.930
Right now there are actually two persons. There's one in com Udacity, and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.495
there's one in Car-share seven. So, all of the classes that I copied into

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:26.247
different packages, I need to remove. So I'll remove car, and it's okay that

00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:31.505
I'm permanently removing it because I copied it. And then I'll remove person

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:36.771
and I'll remove simulation. So like I just mentioned, right now Car isn't

00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:40.668
compiling. What import statements would you need to add to this project to make

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:44.762
it compile again? Go ahead and reorganize all of the classes into the right

00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:50.954
packages. Then to get the CarShareApp running again. To which class should I

00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:55.770
add the import com.udacity.person? Write none if I never need to import this.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.510
To which class should I add the import com.udacity.carshare.car? And to which

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.053
close should I add the import com.udacity.carshare.simulation? And remember

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.998
write none if you never use a particular import statement. And separate answers

00:03:10.998 --> 00:03:15.161
with commas, if you find that there are two classes that use the same import.
