00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now we can look at this as a decision problem

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and we'll call it the long and simple path decision problem and it goes like this.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Given a graph G and a link L and two nodes U and V,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is there a simple path from U to V consisting of L or more nodes?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're not looking for a short path, we're actually looking for a long and simple path,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we're going to imagine and I'm saying imagine because I actually don't know

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
whether this is true or not, but we're going to imagine that there is an algorithm

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that solves this decision problem, yes or no correctly,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and its running time is n to the k for some constant k like two.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Θ(n²) or 10 like Θ(n¹⁰) or a thousand Θ(n¹⁰⁰⁰) but k is not a function of n.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It can't be an exponential or it's going to be bounded by some polynomial.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It could be a nasty polynomial, but let's just imagine that it's bounded by a polynomial.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Here's a different problem. Find a simple path from U to V in G consisting of L or more nodes.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This one is just asking me yes no question. This one is actually asking for the path.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And we'd like to know is there a polynomial time solution to this problem, we'll call it problem B.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Assuming that there is a polynomial time solution for problem A.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We can use the solution of problem A as subroutine in solving problem B. All right.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Here's how we like you to do it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I want you to write a Python command called long and simple path that takes a graph G

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and node U, node V, and the link L

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and it's allowed to call long and simple decision with whatever it wants.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
As many time as it wants as long as it's a polynomial in the number of

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
nodes and edges in the graph, and ultimately return the path that there is one.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Here's a little skeleton to get you started.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We call long and simple decision G, U, V, L and if it's the case that the decision problems says

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
or the solution to this decision problem says there is no path of link L or greater from U, V, and G

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
then you don't have to do anything, just return false.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But otherwise, you actually need to build and return the path as a list of nodes

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and the first element, at least should be U and the last element should be V

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and all the steps in between should be actual edges

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the total number of nodes on that path needs to be at least L.
