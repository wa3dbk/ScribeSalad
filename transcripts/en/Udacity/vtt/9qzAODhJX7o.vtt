00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.650
Now I know its really tempting to think that the answer is seven but this would

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.698
be a mistake. We know that the square root of five is really just a number. So

00:00:08.698 --> 00:00:13.960
we have seven times one number minus one times another number. So if we have

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.540
seven of one number and we subtract one of that number. Then we'll six of that

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.260
number left. This is why this answer is really six times the square root of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.708
five. If we think about factoring the square root of 5 from both of these

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:30.299
terms, we would be left with the quantity of 7 minus 1 times the square root of

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:36.224
5, and when we subtract, we'll get 6 times root 5. Another way to think about

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:40.226
this reasoning is with an object. If you thought the answer was seven, then

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:44.200
consider this, if we had seven cakes and subtracted a cake we wouldn't be left

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.967
with seven cakes we'd really be left with six cakes. This is sort of an analogy

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:53.987
for what's going on here we have seven cakes at root 5's minus one cake or 1

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:59.104
root 5. This leaves us left with 6 root 5.
