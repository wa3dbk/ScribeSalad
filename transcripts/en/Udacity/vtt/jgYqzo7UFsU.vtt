00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.890
At the end of this unit, you'll be asked
to do a project on supervised learning.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.210
We'll give you a label data set and

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.150
ask you to instruct multiple
models of that data.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.437
You'll then comment on those models
from the perspectives of accuracy,

00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:13.671
predictive power,
computational efficiency.

00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:16.930
And decide what you think is
the best model for that data.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.970
That's another project for
your portfolio as well.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.220
Your portfolio will then have an example
of you actually using supervised

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.680
learning techniques to generate new
conclusions about some incoming data.
