00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:04.509
We're going to introduce one of the most important parallel primitives--scan.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.926
Let me give you a very short example of a scan operation.

00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:11.593
The input to scan is a list of numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:13.961
and an operation, such as add,

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:17.201
and the output is the running sum of those numbers.

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:22.300
So each output is the sum of all the numbers in the input up to that given point.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.239
6 is the sum of 1, 2, and 3.

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.907
Scan is important because it allows us to address a set of problems

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:31.276
that seem difficult to parallelize.

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:36.765
At first glance it might seem difficult to compute this output from this input in parallel

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.394
because each element in the output depends on the previous element.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:45.427
So 1st we compute this, add 2 and get 3, add 3 and get 6, add 4 and get 10.

00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:47.832
That doesn't seem like a very parallel operation.

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:51.870
But this style of operation turns out to be incredibly useful.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.670
It's also interesting because scan is just not a very useful operation in the serial world.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.836
It's really only useful when you're doing parallel computation.

00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:03.341
But once you know it and use it, you'll wonder what you ever did without it.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.374
There's lots of uses for scan, with compaction and allocation being 2 of the most popular.

00:01:09.374 --> 00:01:12.542
Later in this lecture we'll discuss histogram, which uses scan.

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:15.986
And our research group has used scan for quick sort, for sparse matrix computation,

00:01:15.986 --> 00:01:20.000
and for data compression, among others. It's a very useful parallel primitive.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.896
But for this part of the lecture I'm only going to concentrate on what scan does

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:26.628
and how it works rather than how it's useful.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:30.441
We'll learn about some more general scan applications in the next unit.
