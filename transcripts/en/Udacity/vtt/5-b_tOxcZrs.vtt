Here's our calculator and all we need to do is plug in e to the power of 10. So

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.010
remember, luckily we have a button for the number e, it is right here. That'll

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.372
take us to the power, remember you press the button x to the y and our exponent

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:23.690
is 10. So now we enter that. Great. E to the 10 equals wow a big number. 22026

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.991
and some decimal. So round it to the nearest integer, that's 22026. Awesome.
