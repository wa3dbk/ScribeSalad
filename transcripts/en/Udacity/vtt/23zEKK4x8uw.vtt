Well, they both share a factor of x plus y. Remember that a here is one factor,

and the quantity x plus y is another factor, since we're multiplying these two

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.943
numbers together. The same is true on the right, 2 is a factor, and then x plus

00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:15.228
y is another factor.
