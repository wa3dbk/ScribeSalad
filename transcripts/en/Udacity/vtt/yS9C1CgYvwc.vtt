Okay. Now what would happen to the dog's response if we repeatedly presented

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:10.974
the tone and never followed it with meat powder? It would salivate more. It

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:16.040
would salivate less. It would bark. Or, it would stop salivating. So check as

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.574
many or as few of the responses that you think are correct. If you're not sure,

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:23.740
that's okay. Just think carefully about the question and give it a try.
