00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.380
A bit earlier you changed some
permissions on the authorized key file

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.030
and the .ssh directory using
a command called chmod.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.090
But what exactly does that mean?

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.480
Let's dive a bit deeper into how
Linux manages file permissions.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.740
I've listed the contents of
the students' home directory.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.060
And we're going to look at three
pieces of information provided here.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.830
The first column we've
looked at briefly before.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.040
Remember the d means
that this is a directory.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.420
The dash means that it's a file.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.610
Now, you might think that there are nine
additional spaces here for information,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.810
but what's actually happening is
there are three separate sections and

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.460
each of those sections has
three pieces of information.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.260
Let's break out this entry here for
bash.rc.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.459
The three individual entries are rw-,
r--, and r--.

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:52.580
Let's go ahead and
label each of these entries.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.800
This first one I'm labeling owner,
then group, and finally everyone.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.410
This means the owner can read and
write the file.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.390
The dash here indicates that
the owner cannot execute the file.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.980
If they could, there would be an x here.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.290
Users within the group can read
this file, but they cannot write or

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.800
execute it.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.920
Finally, everyone can read this file,
but they cannot write or execute it.
