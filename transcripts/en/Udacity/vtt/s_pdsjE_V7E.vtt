00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.430
Let's pretend you're traveling 100 miles, this will cost $180.13. If you

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.330
want to travel 101 miles, this will cost you $180.33. The difference here is 20

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.930
cents and notice that's the slope. Remember when we said earlier that the slope

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.560
is the change in y, after we change x by one unit. In this case the units are

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.706
miles. So with every additional mile traveled, you would expect to pay 20 more

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:34.276
cents.
