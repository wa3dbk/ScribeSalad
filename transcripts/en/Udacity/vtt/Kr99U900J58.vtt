00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.280
Let's look at the solution to the second part of this quiz,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.310
which is about figuring out, when do these two instructions issue dispatch and

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.750
write results. We first have to figure out when the add here will issue.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.340
Normally, it would issue in cycle five, assuming that the reservation station is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.170
available. Let's check whether a reservation station is available in cycle five.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.670
At this time we have already issued two ADDs, so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.990
we can occupy both of the reservation stations. So one is available here,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.920
only if one of these two ADDs frees our reservation station before a cycle five.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.940
So reservation station is available only if one of these two frees its

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.800
reservation station before cycle five. Note that our reservation station needs

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.580
to be freed a cycle earlier than when we allocate it, so if we are going to

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.040
use it in cycle five, it needs to be freed in cycle four. Unfortunately,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.980
these two adds do not release their reservation stations until cycles 10 and 12.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.630
The first one that becomes available will be freed in cycle ten.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.040
It cannot be allocated to this add immediately. So

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.130
this add can only issue in cycle 11 because it needs this reservation station.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.570
Once this add issues, it might dispatch in cycle 12, assuming

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.360
that it has no dependencies. And indeed, it doesn't. So it issues in cycle 12,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.300
and then executes for one cycle, and broadcasts its result in cycle 13.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.350
The next add here will issue in cycle 12,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.950
because issue needs to be done in order. So if this one issues in cycle 11,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.650
the next add in the program order will not be considered for

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.730
issuing until cycle 12. So we will try cycle 12, but

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.870
we have to check whether a reservation station is available. This add by then

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.110
has freed the reservation station but these two are still holding onto theirs.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.280
Note that this add here is freeing its reservation station in cycle 12, but

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.850
it cannot be allocated to a new instruction in the same cycle. So

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.980
this add here actually issues in cycle 13, and then it doesn't wait for

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.920
anything because F3 and F4 are not produced by previous instructions. So

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.784
it will dispatch in cycle 14 and finally write it's result in cycle 15.
