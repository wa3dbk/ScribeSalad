00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.891
One thing that has fascinated me for literally my entire life, is stars, and

00:00:03.891 --> 00:00:08.119
how far away from us they are. Did you know that when we look at a star, like

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.955
the sun for example, we're looking at something from the past because of the

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:15.905
time it takes the light to reach us. That's pretty weird and pretty awesome, I

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.880
think. So let's work out how long it takes the light to reach us from the sun.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.424
As you saw before, the distance from the earth to the sun is approximately 1.5

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:29.932
times 10 to the 11th meters. Light travels at a speed of 3 times 10 to the 8th

00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:34.896
meters per second. As we can see from the units of speed here, meters per

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:38.678
second, speed is equal to some distance, divided by the time it takes to go

00:00:38.678 --> 00:00:44.362
that distance. Now thinking about this equation, what do we need to do to

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:49.880
calculate time? Do we need to multiply speed by distance, divide distance by

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.449
speed or divide speed by distance?
