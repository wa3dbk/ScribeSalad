00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This first question asks us to make a few statements about formal grammars.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's go over a little bit of vocabulary.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A language is simply a set of strings.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A regular language is a type of language.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In particular, it's a set of strings that can be represented by

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a finite-state machine or a regular expression.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A context-free language is also a set of strings

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but can be represented by context-free grammar,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and what these 3 questions are asking us in this problem

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is to determine the relationship between a regular language and a context-free language,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so let's say this bubble represents the set of regular languages.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's a set of sets of strings.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And let's say this blob is the set of context-free languages.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What we want to determine is how we can connect these two.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is it the case that no regular languages are context-free languages and vice versa?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Or perhaps there are some regular languages that are not context-free.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There are some context-free languages that are not regular,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but there are some languages that are regular and context-free.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And the last 2 possibilities are that all regular languages are context-free and vice versa.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This kind of looks like a Pac-Man. Nom, nom.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
As it turns out, this diagram is the correct one.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
All regular languages are context-free, but not all context-free languages are regular.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Briefly in lecture, Wes outlined the proof that all regular languages are context-free.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The way the proof works is that you show that given an arbitrary

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
finite-state machine, you can create a context-free grammar

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that embodies it, that represents the same functionality.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Namely, it generates the same exact set of strings,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and to show that there are some context-free languages that are not regular,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we just have to come up with an example.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
An example of this is this set of matching parentheses.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
As it turns out--and I'm not going to prove it here--you can't represent this language

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
with a regular expression.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
That's because you can't count

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
how many times you see a left parentheses

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and then require that you see exactly that many right parentheses.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
There's just no form of counting in a regular expression.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You can't hold that much state.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Given that review, let's go over the actual questions.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
If a language is regular, than that language is also context-free.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is always true because we have our Pac-Man diagram here,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and also because you can take any regular language

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and represent it with a context-free grammar.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You can take any finite-state machine and represent it with a context-free grammar.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
If a language L is context-free, than that language L is also regular.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This is sometimes true.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If we have a regular language, that language is context-free,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and, well, it's also regular.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We have a case where sometimes a context-free language is regular.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The question is is this always true, and the answer is no.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
If we have a context-free language such as the matching parentheses I went over before,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
this is a language that's context-free, but it's not regular.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Sometimes this statement is true, and sometimes it's not.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
If 2 context-free grammars, G1 and G2,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
both accept an infinite number of strings, than they accept the same strings.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is sometimes true.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Let's think of a couple examples.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Well, there's a straightforward example that shows

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that this is a statement that can be true,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and that is when G1 and G2 are the same grammar.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Let's say we have the language ba* that Wes likes to use in the examples.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We have baaa, baaaaa.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
All right, so we have ba*.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Let's say we have the grammar G2.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And you know what?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Let's make it the same exact language.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I have 2 grammars.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Both accept an infinite number of strings.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
They happen to be the same strings, so this statement is sometimes true.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We didn't say G1 and G2 had to be unique.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You could also come up with examples where G1 and G2 are different,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
but they're the same exact string, so you could do baa*.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And you'll also note I used a regular expression for my grammar,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but all regular languages are context-free, so this is perfectly acceptable.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Let's come up with a situation where this isn't true.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Let's change G2 so that instead of ba*

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it's fa*, so we've got fa, faaa, and faa.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I don't know, a lot of a's.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
These are both infinite, infinite grammars.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They're regular expressions, therefore, they're context-free,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but they don't accept the same strings, so we've come up with a case

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
where this can be true, and we come up with a case where it can be false,

00:04:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so we're going to say it's sometimes true.
