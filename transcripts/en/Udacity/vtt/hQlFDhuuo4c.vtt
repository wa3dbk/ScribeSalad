When you want to just try an idea out in BlueJ, you have a couple options to

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.370
start. One is to open the test prog BlueJ project that we made for you. It's in

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.830
the files for lesson 1. The other option is to make a new project using BlueJ.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.130
To open the test prog project, open up BlueJ, click the Project menu, and then

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.600
from the drop down select Open Project. Use the window that pops up to navigate

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.560
to wear ever the lesson 1 code is. Double click, and open Testprog. It should

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.670
look something like this. If you right click, you can open the editor. And then

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.280
you have a main method all set up and ready to go for you where you can put

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.860
whatever code you want to try out. If instead of using the test project that we

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.150
made for you, you want to make a new project. You would go to the same Project

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.555
menu, select New Project. And then give it a name. Some examples are compiler

00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:02.990
runtime, errors, hello, whatever your project is going to be about. I'll just

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.000
call this one a new project. Now I close whatever project I had open before and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.800
I can see my new project. Before I can write code in it, though, I have to

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.295
click New Class. And then come up with a name. I'll just call this one Testing

00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:23.480
An Idea for now. Now you edit this the same way you always would. Open Editor,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.820
and there's a lot of stuff in here. I always just delete it. Except for the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.170
class definition. And then add back whatever code I need to try out the thing I

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.030
want to try. Again, you can put whatever code you want in here. Now that you've

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.710
seen how to make a new testing project, let's put that skill to use. We're

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.720
going to try out some code.
