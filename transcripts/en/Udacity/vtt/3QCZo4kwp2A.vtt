00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here is my answer. It would start by yielding 0.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Then for i in all the positive integers yield first +i and then -i.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you didn't want to use ints here, you could do an alternative solution that looks like this.

00:00:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
While True means it's an infinite loop, and I'm yielding +i and -i and then incrementing.
