00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:03.393
So let's state the specific problem that we want to solve today,

00:00:03.393 --> 00:00:05.232
and then we'll look at how we might solve it.

00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:08.309
We want to start at a specific node, and we'll call it s.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.414
And then visit every node in the graph and record its distance

00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:13.986
from s in terms of graph hops.

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:15.895
We call this quantity its depth.

00:00:15.895 --> 00:00:18.564
So any neighbor of s has depth 1.

00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:20.355
Any neighbor of those neighbors

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.702
that we haven't visited yet has depth 2.

00:00:22.702 --> 00:00:27.736
And in general, a neighbor of a node with depth d that hasn't already been visited has depth d plus 1.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:32.404
I'm not sure how familiar our international audience is with the actor Kevin Bacon,

00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:37.713
but the Bacon number of a particular actor is the number of degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon.

00:00:37.713 --> 00:00:41.620
So if I had acted in a movie a movie with say, John Belushi,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.730
my Bacon number would be 2,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.089
because John Belushi's Bacon number is 1,

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.655
because he appeared with Kevin Bacon in the outstanding film, Animal House.

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:52.945
We could generate the Bacon numbers for all movie actors

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:55.894
from a graph that records who appeared in movies together,

00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:59.937
and we could do this with a breadth-first traversal that begins at Kevin Bacon

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:03.937
and calculates depth for each vertex for actor in the graph.
