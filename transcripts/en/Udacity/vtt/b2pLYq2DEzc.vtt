So how do we learn to describe the world within our skin? What's going on?

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.956
Well, we learn, through trial and error, experience, and reinforcement. So,

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:13.930
here's an example. My niece, Sophia was about six years old. And we were at the

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.630
airport, and she was going to fly to Switzerland for the summer to see her

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.056
Grammy. And she said, aunt Sue, my tummy feels funny. And I said oh, honey

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:26.726
those are called butterflies, you're just nervous about flying. She said no it,

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:30.770
it doesn't feel right. It kind of hurts. I said no, no. That's just called

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.846
nervousness or anxiousness. And she kept telling that something was wrong, and

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:40.120
I was trying to describe it as excitement, as anxiousness. And it turns out

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.320
that when they got to Switzerland, my brother called me, and Sophia actually

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.940
was vomiting the entire way. so, it turns out that Aunt Sue was wrong. she

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.800
wasn't anxious, she wasn't nervous, she actually had some type of stomach bug.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.148
But that's an example of me as an adult, trying to teach a child about what's

00:00:57.148 --> 00:01:02.833
going on inside their skin. So, besides experiencing pain or an upset stomach,

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:07.279
how do we describe feelings such as love or passion? There's a lot of

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:11.311
literature out there on love and passion. But until you experience it, it's

00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:13.100
very difficult to describe.
