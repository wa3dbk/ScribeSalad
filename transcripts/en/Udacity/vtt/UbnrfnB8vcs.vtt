00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.782
&gt;&gt; So let's say we have this population here. I calculated that the mean is

00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:09.964
18.97, approximately, and standard deviation is 5.99. If you want you can go

00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:15.374
ahead and see if you get those same parameters. By the way, I randomly generated

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:20.588
these numbers using R. So let's take a sample. Let's say this is our first

00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:26.192
sample. It includes 18, 20, 23, 18, 21, 15, 17, 22, and 21. So there are 9 in

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:32.104
this sample. Calculate the standard deviation of this sample the way that you've

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:32.846
learned.
