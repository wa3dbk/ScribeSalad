Now that you've heard of the this reference, open up your code for drawing the

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.326
lines between people. Remember how we had to make up these special names,

00:00:07.326 --> 00:00:13.430
xCoord, yCoord and aName, to avoid bugs from shadowing. You wouldn't have

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.940
called it that at the time but that's what we were doing. I want you to rewrite

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.335
this constructor to use name, x and y, for the parameter variable names.
