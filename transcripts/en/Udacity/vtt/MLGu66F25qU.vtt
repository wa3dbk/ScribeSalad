Surveys are one of the easiest ways to get info on a population. Sometimes it is

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:09.446
really difficult to conduct the survey, but surveys are often a lot easier than

00:00:09.458 --> 00:00:14.639
doing, say, a controlled experiment. They're also relatively inexpensive. They

00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:19.188
mostly just require time to implement, and for the respondents to write their

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.307
answers. Surveys can also be conducted remotely. You might have gotten a survey

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:29.084
in the mail at one point. And finally, this is my favorite thing about surveys.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.947
Anyone can access and analyze survey results if the survey owner is willing to

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:39.150
give out that data. But assuming they are, the survey results are timeless. The

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:44.135
National Center for Education Statistics created this Education Longitudinal

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:48.945
Study and thanks to them, I was able to look at factors that influence effort

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:53.820
including how much students enjoy school, or how much students value school, or

00:00:53.832 --> 00:00:58.485
their relationship with their teachers, their gender, and a bunch of other

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:03.010
things. it was really fun and interesting to analyze this data. Looking at

00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:07.241
someone else's survey results can be a lot easier than conducting your own

00:01:07.253 --> 00:01:07.644
survey.
