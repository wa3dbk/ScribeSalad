00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's a usual thing to note that there's a relationship between the class NP

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the cluster problems that are solvable in exponential time.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Any problems that's in NP is also going to be solvable in exponential time.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the set of exponential time solvable problems includes NP.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now that by includes I mean that it takes at most exponential time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
None of the problems in NP can be any harder than that,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
say requiring double exponential time or factorial time or whatever happens will be,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
they can all be solvable in exponential time.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So if the problem is in NP that means there's a bound on the size of the certificate needed.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Say it's polynomial n to the c for some constant that's specific to this problem,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
where n is related to the size of the input

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and there is also a bound on the running time of the verification algorithm like n to the k where

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
again is related to the size of the input and k is some constant that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
can depend on the problem but it can't depend on the input.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Well, if we have those two things, we can actually create an algorithm

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that can solve the problem for any input.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So what it needs to do is we can just run through all the certificates

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that could possibly be relevant for the input x and for each one we run the verification algorithm,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and if the verification algorithm ever says--oh, yeah that's something that shows that x is true,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
then we can return true as the solution for the problem and if we run through

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
all the possible certificates and none of them made the accepting, the verification algorithm return true

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
then we can return false, and the running time of this algorithm

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
is well the number of times we go to this loop is like 2 to the n to the c,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
if we imagine the size of this certificate is written down in bits.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is the number of different assignments of bits to certificates of this size.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So if we run through all possible into those, we know that we've checked everything

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and then for each of those the running time is in the order of n to the k.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So the total running time is like n to the k,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which is a polynomial times 2 to the n to the c, which is exponential.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So the total running time is exponential. It's not worse than exponential. It's not great.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Unless we are talking about problems that are really tiny, this is going to be horrible,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but sometimes problems really are tiny and mostly I'm introducing this as a way of just connecting

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
these two concepts of the class NP and what it means to be able to find an exponential time.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's nice to know that at least any problem that's in NP is solvable.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
All right, we can write an algorithm that would run it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It just that algorithm may take a very, very long time to complete.
