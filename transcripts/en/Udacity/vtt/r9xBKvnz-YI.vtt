00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.210
Of course, it's nearly impossible to graph performance into

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.200
your application after it's already been built, but before

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.890
we get into good performance patterns, the first step

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.990
to insuring great performance, is being able to analyze your

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.170
performance. I want to introduce you to Colt McAnlis,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.790
who you may remember from his excellent HTML 5 game

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.700
development course. Colt's going to show you how to analyze

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.390
your performance using the Chrome developer tools. Many developers take

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.950
way too long to start addressing performance in their applications. You see,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.189
they get in their time lines and schedules, and they try to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.470
get features checked in, and all these other things. And way too

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.110
late in the game, they actually realize that performance is actually a

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.670
huge issue. But you, because you're watching this video and we're having

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.500
this little private one on one talk. Are not going to fall into

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.680
that same pattern, instead your going to do two things to stay out

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.710
of it, now the first thing your going to do, is your actually

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.540
going to follow the perfmatters hash tag on your favorite social

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.130
media network, there's a lot of smart people talking a lot

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.380
about web performance. All over the net. And following this

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.270
hashtag is going to get you keyed into the exact problems on

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.510
the net and how to fix them. The second thing

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.240
you're going to do, is you're actually going to become an amazing ninja

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.220
by using Chrome developer tools to find your performance problems. Now,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.810
we're going to walk through some of the key scenarios. And some

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.610
of the key tools that you're going to use

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.730
to address these problems. Let's take a look.
