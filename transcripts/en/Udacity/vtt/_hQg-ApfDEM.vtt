00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.680
So median filtering for

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.250
background subtraction does
exactly what you might think.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.560
All right, now we're going to
assume that the background

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.510
will be modeled by the last end framed
but I'm not going to take the average.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.250
I'm going to take the median value.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.550
What's kind of nice about that is
now n can be kind of nice and long.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.360
Let's suppose the average, let's
suppose when I look at the, the road.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.952
Let's suppose its value is 57.

00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:33.410
Plus or minus a little,
57, 58, 56, 52, 57, etc,.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.502
Then comes along a white car.

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:38.866
[NOISE] And it's like got 112,
119, 194, fine.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.730
Then comes along a black Porsche.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.350
Slowly because he's being cool,
you know it's three and not.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.890
But if you take a look
at all those values,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.950
the one that's going to dominate is
going to be the 57 to 56 etc, so

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.300
when I do a median filter, that's
the one that's going to get pulled out.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.440
So now your foreground mask is we
just take the current image and

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.270
we subtract that the median
of the last end frames, okay?

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.459
And again, threshold.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.490
Your n by the way now is
a little less sensitive.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.480
I mean it has to be big
enough to capture it.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.780
There is, as you know, those of
you know about in your computing,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.530
a running average is easy to compute.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.020
You just have to know how many frames
you've, you've added into the average so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.980
far and the previous average and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.740
then it's 1 over n of the new 1
plus n minus 1 over n of the old 1.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.050
A median,
you have to actually keep them.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.410
And then resort them, and
that can be expensive.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.070
So, unless you'd play some interesting
tricks, median filtering can be

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.660
expensive, but it, but it's,
it's not too much of a problem.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.580
All right.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.510
When you apply the median, well,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.410
it turns out if you use short n,
it might not be quite so great.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.240
So, for example, here we have
the estimated background and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.510
you can see a lot of stuff has gotten
cleaned up, but because of the small

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.450
n I still get this problem in terms
of where the van is and you're

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.070
doing a better job getting the van but
you still get a little bit of the stuff
