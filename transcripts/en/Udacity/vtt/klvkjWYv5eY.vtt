00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.344
We multiply this first fraction by p plus 3 divided by p plus 3. The denominator

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:11.596
here is missing a factor of p plus 3. This is the one factor we need in order to

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:16.995
change our denominator into the LCD. For our second fraction we multiply by p

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:21.670
minus 1 divided by p minus 1. And this denominator, p minus 1 is the missing

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.904
factor we need in order to get the LCD. Now we multiply these two numerators

00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:30.808
together and these two denominators together this gives us our new first

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:35.347
equivalent fraction. We do the same process for the second fraction to get this,

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:39.784
these two denominators may look different but they really the same. We know the

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:44.107
order of the factors don't matter because its multiplication. Now that the two

00:00:44.107 --> 00:00:48.580
fractions have like denominators, we can simply add the numerators together. We

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.450
add the like terms. The p's and the constants. 1 p and 1 p would equal 2 p and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.075
positive 3 and negative 1 would equal positive 2. Now that we're here, we should

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:04.489
ask ourselves, are we done? Well, we added two things in a numerator together,

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.871
so we have a new numerator entirely. We want to see if we can factor it if

00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:14.512
possible, and it turns out we can. We can take out a 2, to have 2 times p plus

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:19.178
1. But this doesn't really help us. We can't cancel a factor of p plus 1 since

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:24.139
another factor of p plus 1 does not appear in the denominator. So the answer is

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:29.698
yes, we're done, and here's the addition of these two rational expressions. Now

00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:31.793
this is some algebra.
