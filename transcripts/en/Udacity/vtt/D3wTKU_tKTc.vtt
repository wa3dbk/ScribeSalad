If you got 64 minus 9 y squared, excellent work. This problem was a little bit

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.347
tricky, because I switched the signs on the parentheses. But remember with

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:14.198
multiplication, we can switch the order of our parentheses, 2 times 3 is the

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:18.920
same as 3 times 2. The same is true for more complicated expressions, so the 8

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.830
is my a, and the 3y is my b. A Squared would be 64, we just square 8. Then we

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.375
have a subtraction sign and then we have b squared, which is 9y squared. Good

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:31.049
thinking if you got it.
