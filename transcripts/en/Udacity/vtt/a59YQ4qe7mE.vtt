00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.830
What about rotation?

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.220
So here,
I'm basically showing a simple example.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.135
I have two points, x and, this would
be the original points here, and

00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:11.590
x prime, y prime, where I want
the transformation to happen.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.400
Of course, in this case,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.850
these two vectors kind of show how the
transformation would be, and of course,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.700
there would be an angle
associated with this.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.130
Let's call that theta.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.140
So in case now,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.430
just looking at the simple 2D example,
let me ask the question.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.271
So in this case of the simple
2D rotation by a theta,

00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.510
where I have transformed points x and
y to x prime, y prime.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.558
Question comes up is, how would I now
figure out the values of x prime,

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.840
y prime, given x and
y and this angle theta?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.550
Now, if you may remember this from
your old trigonometry classes,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.040
this can be done, and I encourage you
to look it up again if you haven't,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.532
looked at such things recently.

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:50.288
And this would basically say that x
prime would basically be computed by

00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:54.647
taking the cosine of the angle
theta here, with x the original x,

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:56.012
minus y sine theta.

00:00:56.012 --> 00:01:01.780
And similarly y prime would be given
by x sine theta plus y sine theta.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.080
So this basically now gives us an input,
interesting way.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.640
Now of course I can write
this in a matrix form,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.540
which basically would
mean I would move x and

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.400
y into a column, which would now give
me the elements of the M matrix.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.764
So M in this case would be cosine
theta minus sine theta, sine theta,

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:17.570
cosine theta.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.395
And if of course,

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.755
knowing this angle I can apply
this as an image transformation.

00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:26.285
Again, I encourage you to look this up
or try to kind of do the derivation.

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:27.995
Just as a hint, to do this derivation,

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:30.905
you'd also need to
represent this angle and

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:34.145
then basically come up with equations
to kind of compare all of these.
