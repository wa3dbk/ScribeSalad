00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.886
These first three values of f we want to rewrite can be rewritten using

00:00:04.886 --> 00:00:11.862
exponents, 2 times 2 is just 2 squared. Three 2s, multiplied together, is 2 to

00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:18.842
the 3rd, and 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 is 2 to the 4th power. We can see here

00:00:18.842 --> 00:00:23.630
that the base of each of these exponential expressions is 2, and in each one,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.796
the exponent corresponds to the value of x. The same should be true for these

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:35.864
three values of f down here. F of 10 should be 2 to the 10. F of 100 should be

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:42.790
2 to the 100, and f of x should just be two to the x. Now, maybe without even

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.806
realizing it, you've actually just found the equation for your first

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:52.615
exponential function. It's right here, f of x equals 2 to the x. So that you

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.450
can keep acquainting yourself with different exponential functions, I'm

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.789
actually going to give you a new one to check out right now.
