00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.130
This video doesn't contain an exhaustive list of everything you

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.140
might have related to exploratory data analysis. But here are

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.390
some of the things that we thought about. If you

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.510
have other ideas, please share your thoughts on the forum. The

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.290
first thing I notice is that Nathan used histograms to

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.910
show the distribution of TV sizes in any given year.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.190
You can also see that for each year, Nathan included

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.050
a dark line in the middle. Which represents the median size

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.900
television for that year. So in 2005, it looks like

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.950
the median TV size was about 40 inches. So half

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.670
the TVs were larger and half of them were smaller.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.410
Second, Nathan describes where the data originated. In this case he

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.110
got his data from CNET Reviews. Nathan describes a caveat

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.470
in the source of his data. He mentioned that the

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.570
screen sizes are based on the TVs that were on

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.070
the market at the time and not on how many people

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.100
actually bought them. The average television size that people

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.070
bought could be quite different from the average television size

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.870
on the market. I think the second part is key

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.350
and is something we should remember when approaching any data

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.010
set. We should always be skeptical of what story the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.640
data may tell. We should ask questions about our data,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.550
inspect it and consider its context. Finally, Nathan conducted a

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.550
time series analysis. So each year after 2002, Nathan indicates

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.080
whether the median size of televisions increased

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.140
or whether or not it decreased. In

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.060
the case of the circle, we know that the television size remained the same.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.100
This leaves me wondering what television sizes are doing now. Maybe you can find

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.560
some data out there and let us know by the end of the course.
