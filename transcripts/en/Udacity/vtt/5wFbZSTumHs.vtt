00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.650
Planning is another process central to cognition.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.260
It is central because action selection is central to cognition. You and

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.060
I are constantly faced with the problem of selecting actions.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.170
Where should I go for dinner today? What should I cook for dinner today? How do

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.530
I cook what I wanted to cook? I got a bonus. What should I do with the bonus?

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.600
Shall I go for a vacation? How should I go to a vacation?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.840
Where should I go to a vacation? These are all problems of action selection. And

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.800
I need planning to select the appropriate actions.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.110
Cognitive agents also have multiple goals. As a professor, one of my

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.300
goals right now is to talk with you. Another goal that I have is to become rich,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.290
although I know that becoming a professor is not going to make me rich.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.340
The point is that cognitive agents have multiple goals that can

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.410
have interactions between them. Sometimes interaction is positive.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.420
Achieving one goal provides an opportunity for achieving the second goal.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.570
Sometime the interaction is negative, there are conflicts. Cognitive agents

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.000
detect those conflicts. They avoid those conflicts. And planning, then,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
is a central process for achieving multiple goals at the same time.
