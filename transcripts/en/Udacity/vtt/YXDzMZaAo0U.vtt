00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.088
Say you've designed your robot, now you want to put a skin over his frame to

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:06.400
make him look more lifelike and infiltrate the humans, become more accepted by

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.015
humanity. A robot model typically has a few rigid elements that do not change

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:15.756
over time, such as a forearm and an upper arm. At the joint the objects are

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:19.804
clearly separate. That's where you'd like to put skin. One simple solution is

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:22.610
to just put some triangles connecting the two rigid pieces, sort of like a

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.905
cylinder. As the joint bends, these triangles deform and stretch, keeping the

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:31.220
two arm pieces attached. This doesn't look very good as the more the arm bends,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.022
the more the joint flattens out. What we'd prefer is something more like a

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:38.742
flexible tube that bends, but mostly keeps its shape. Say we now add such a

00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:42.872
joint, with three cylinders, one after the other. The challenge now is how to

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:46.590
move these cylinder vertices as the joint bends. The basic solution is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.377
surprisingly simple. Each vertex is assigned a weight. This weight is how much

00:00:51.377 --> 00:00:55.319
each rigid part's position affects the vertex. The top and bottom of the tube

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.619
still stays connected to its rigid body part, so that body part's influence has

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:03.370
a weight of 1. For vertices closer to the forearm, the weight is say, 2 3rds

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.740
forearm, 1 3rds upper arm. This modeling process of adding polygons and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.218
assigning weights is called skinning, or sometimes vertex blending. The rigid

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:16.000
parts of the model are defined by bones. These bones are like a skeleton, so

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.890
this whole area is sometimes called skeletal animation. As a bone moves, the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.716
skin is influenced by the bone's transform times its weight. Specifically,

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:27.170
let's look at this one vertex on the skin that's near the forearm. The vertex

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.000
location is transformed twice. Once with respect to the forearm, and once with

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.995
respect to the upper arm. These two transformed locations are then multiplied

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:38.915
by their corresponding weights, giving the interpolated point between them. The

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.526
basic algorithm works fairly well, but can have problems. For example, in the

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:45.968
inner part of the elbow, the points may bend inwards in an unconvincing way. In

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:49.959
practice, the vertex can be influenced by more than two bones. The bones and

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.533
weights are something the person modeling decides, and the weights always add

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:56.298
up to 1. These characters were exported from Valve's Team Fortress 2 game and

00:01:56.298 --> 00:02:00.099
animated with Three.js' skinning class called skinned mesh. Skinning is well

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.125
suited to the GPU, as the vertex shader can transform plates multiple times and

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:08.860
add together the weighted locations. There are more elaborate algorithms that

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.674
give better results, but for interactive rendering in particular, skinning is

00:02:11.674 --> 00:02:12.970
the mainstay.
