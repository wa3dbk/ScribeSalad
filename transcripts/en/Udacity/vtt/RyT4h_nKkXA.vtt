00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.800
We have now explored the data set and drawn a few histograms.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.810
This particular quiz is not graded.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.650
But please do follow the exercise along.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.900
Use what your learned in lesson two about the irreducible variance to treat

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.610
the average values of the three variables as random variables and

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.300
the standard deviation as the irreducible variance int he data.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.150
So write code to do the following.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.540
First, draw histogram of f naught of the charged amounts.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.428
Then in the same plot, make another histogram of f

00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:43.550
naught plus 1 times the standard deviation of f naught,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.290
which is another variable given in your data.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.833
In the same plot again,

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:54.830
draw a histogram of f naught minus 1 times the standard deviation of f naught.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.080
You should see something like a histogram with a error band.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.010
Once you are done with that, click on the box here.
