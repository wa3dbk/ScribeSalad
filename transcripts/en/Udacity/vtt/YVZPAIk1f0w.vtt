00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
Now we finally come to the last part of the business model canvas.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.040
We've talked about value props, customer segments, channels, customer relationships,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.970
revenue streams, partners, resources, and activities, and now we get to cost structure.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.940
It's kind of ironic we're getting to the last part of the business model canvas

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.660
that could actually put us out of business.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.900
Because remember costs need to be less than the revenue stream.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.740
At least if not on day 1, over time,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.640
or else you haven't built a profitable and sustainable business.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
Let's take a look at cost.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.510
If you really think about it, there are two general types of cost.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.310
One called fixed cost, that is how much does my building costs?

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.940
How much are my employee costs going to show up every month,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.990
month to month, that don't move.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.910
The other things are, what are my most important costs?

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.880
Are there resources from the resoures part of the business model canvas?

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.129
Are there activities that are most expensive?

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.630
Did I have to do something with my suppliers?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.010
I really want to understand what's the cost structure to operate the business.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.470
What are my fixed costs? What are my variable costs?

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.650
What are my most expensive resources? What are my most expensive activities?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.250
I want to add them all up and make sure that the interaction between cost and revenue

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.730
has costs less than my revenue.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.410
Again on day 1 you could say no we're not going to make money for the next year, 2, or 3,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.570
and as long as your investors agree and you eventually make money and can prove

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.280
to yourself and them you can make money,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.280
it's okay to have costs being a little more expensive.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.870
But you and your investors need to be in sync about costs versus revenue from day 1.

00:01:54.870 --> 99:59:59.000
This is something you don't want to surprise investors about.
