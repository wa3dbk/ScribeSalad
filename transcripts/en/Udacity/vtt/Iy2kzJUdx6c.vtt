00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.393
The least common denominator is going to be 40. I dont' need to worry about the

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:08.708
4 since 4 goes into 8, so I just need to worry about the 5 in the denominator,

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.215
and the 8 in the denominator. The only factors in common between 5 and 8 are 1.

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:17.644
So that leaves 5 times 1 times 8, which is 40. That quiz is pretty tough, so

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:20.760
don't worry if you didn't get it right on the first try.
