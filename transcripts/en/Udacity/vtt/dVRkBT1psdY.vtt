00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.060
For this module,

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.590
you'll need to open up the file entitled
lesson eight, Calm the compiler.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.493
And now we're going to play a few
rounds of Calm the compiler.

00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:11.573
You'll see a series of
compiler errors and

00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:14.970
quiet them by using
the correct protocols syntax.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.580
In this first error, the Minion class
has adopted the dirty deeds protocol.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.200
But the compiler is complaining.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040
Type minion does not conform
to protocol dirty deeds.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.190
Pause the video.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.780
Take a minute to fix this error.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.680
And then, continue on.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.910
To conform to the dirty deeds protocol,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.800
the Minion class needs to implement
the methods cheat and steal.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.510
So if we add those implementations,
the compiler is happy again.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.080
Let's try another one.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.120
Here we have our DinnerCrew class again,
along with the Souschef protocol.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.310
The goal here is to initialize
a deviousDinnerCrew

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.080
with an array of minions.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.240
But we get the following error.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.940
Cannot invoke initializer for

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.430
type DinnerCrew with an argument
list of type [members: [Minion].

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.930
How can we fix this?

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.080
What could be wrong
with the argument list?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.570
Right now, the Minion class does
not adopt the Souschef protocol.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.520
So minions can't be a part
of the deviousDinnerCrew.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.260
If we add the Souschef protocol to
the Minion class definition, and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.370
then implement the methods in
the Souschef protocol, chopped and

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.760
rinse, this error goes away.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.410
Let's do one more.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.400
Here, we have the DogWalker protocol.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.060
And the class Neighbor is
adopting this protocol.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.060
We've seen this error before.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.380
Type neighbor does not conform
to protocol DogWalker.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.390
Last time we got this error it
was because we hadn't implemented

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.320
the protocol methods yet.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.298
But here you can see that
the methods have been implemented.

00:01:42.298 --> 00:01:43.598
What's going on?

00:01:43.598 --> 00:01:45.483
Here's what's going on.

00:01:45.483 --> 00:01:48.690
The throwBall method signature
in the protocol definition

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.592
indicates that throwBall
should return an int.

00:01:51.592 --> 00:01:54.430
The throwBall method in the Neighbor
class, on the other hand,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.420
is not returning anything.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.010
If we add the return type int to
neighbor's implementation of throwBall,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.050
and then add the line return count,
the compiler is satisfied.
