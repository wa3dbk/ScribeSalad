00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.623
Within 3JS, you can create a set of particles by using the particle system

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:07.520
object. The code here shows one way to make some particles. For the material,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.618
we load a disc texture that is transparent around the edges. Using this texture

00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:14.786
and particle basic material says to make a billboard type of object that points

00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:18.880
towards the camera. In other words, we want to see this sprite texture always

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.498
facing towards us. Setting size attenuation to false means we that want each

00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:27.540
particle to have a constant size on the screen. Setting the size to 35 means

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.683
that we want the particle to be 35 pixels wide. The next bit is to make the

00:00:31.683 --> 00:00:34.177
particle system object itself by using a set of points in the particle

00:00:34.177 --> 00:00:38.746
material. By setting sort particles to true, this means we want the particles

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:42.488
in the system to be sorted with respect to the camera's view. This is

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:46.350
important, as otherwise blending will not occur properly. When you have objects

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.870
with transparency, you need to draw them in a back to front order so that they

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.336
combine correctly. The geometry object you pass into a particle system is a

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:57.275
list of vertices. In this example, 8,000 particles are being created and added

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:01.756
to the scene. I randomly generate these vertices within a box going from

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:06.206
negative 1,000 to 1,000 and x, y, and z. And check that each is inside a sphere

00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:10.385
of radius 1,000. If not I ask for another random point. There are more

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:13.283
efficiently is to generate to random points in a sphere, but this is quick to

00:01:13.283 --> 00:01:17.293
remember in code. Try the demo out, if you dolly out far enough, you'll see the

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:18.580
sphere formed.
