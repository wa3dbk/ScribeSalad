00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.199
Welcome to CS212. Now, in this class,
you're going to be learning by example. So

00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:09.963
I will pose some problems to you and
you'll get a chance to create your

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:15.189
solution. And then I'll show you and
discuss my solution. It's important to

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:20.465
note that there's more then one way to
approach a problem, and I don't mean that

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:26.711
my solution is the only way or the best
way. My solutions are there to help you

00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:32.743
learn a style and some techniques for
programming. But if you saw problems a

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:39.554
different way, that's fine. Good for you.
All learning that goes on happens inside

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:45.699
of your head, not inside of my head. So
what's important is that you understand

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:51.798
the relation between your code and my code
that you get the right answer by writing

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.544
out the solution yourself and then you can
examine my code and maybe pick up some

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:03.558
pointers and some techniques that you can
use later. For example, suppose I ask you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.815
to compute the sum of a list of numbers.
Here's the mathematical formula. And I ask

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:16.990
you to write function, which we'll call
ss, for sum of squares, which takes a list

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:23.590
of numbers as input. If you've taken
CS101, you might write a solution like

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:28.522
this, initialize the total=0.
We'll go through the indices of the

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:33.503
numbers and for each one we'll increment
the total by the square of the number, and

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:37.806
then when we're done we'll return the
total. So that's a perfectly good

00:01:37.818 --> 00:01:42.586
solution. No problems with that
whatsoever. If you're able to come up with

00:01:42.598 --> 00:01:48.275
that you've done your job. But then after
you come up with your solution I'll show

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:54.179
you mine and mine might look like this,
same function definition. But I might

00:01:54.191 --> 00:02:00.008
prefer a functional style rather a
sequencial style where I'm return the sum

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.306
of the squares of X for each X in number.
Now maybe you've never seen something like

00:02:06.318 --> 00:02:12.600
this before maybe you didn't know about
the sum function. Maybe you didn't know

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:19.050
about this type of generator expression in
line so this might all be new to you.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:25.220
Important point is that this solution of
yours is just as valid as mine. So what I

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:30.355
want you to do is just compare your
solution to my solution and see if

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:36.635
there's anything interesting or new in
mine that you might pick up. I don't want

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:41.078
you to say, hey, that's not fair, Peter,
you introduced some new idea that I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.624
haven't seen before. Don't let that make
you upset. Instead, I want you to say,

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:50.234
well, my solution works, but this is
interesting, too, and this is something

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:54.716
new. I want you to be happy that you
learned something new, and proud that you

00:02:54.728 --> 00:02:59.166
came up with a solution that is just as
good. But happen to just use some

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:04.163
different techniques. So remember,
learning is not me saying something and

00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:09.431
pouring that into your head. Rather,
learning is what goes on inside of your

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:14.595
head. And it's up to you to make use of
what I show you. So that you can learn.

00:03:14.712 --> 00:03:20.435
This class is an apprenticeship. You
learned first by observing, then by trying

00:03:20.447 --> 00:03:26.115
it yourself when the next example comes up
and then finally now you really got it

00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:31.845
down when you can take what you've learned
and teach it to someone else, may be in

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:37.621
the forums or may be outside of class. Now
one final point. The problems in this class

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:42.459
are hard, the best learning takes place
when you're challenged and this class

00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:47.440
will challenge you. Don't worry if you
don't get everything on the first try, use

00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:52.056
the forms to ask questions, view the
videos more than once if you think that

00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:56.883
the helps, give yourself time to let new
ideas sink in, you may have to see them

00:03:56.895 --> 00:04:01.424
multiple times before it makes sense so
don't worry about having to review

00:04:01.436 --> 00:04:06.942
multiple times or ask for help. It's hard
but it's fun hard, so welcome to the

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:10.613
class, good luck. I hope you enjoy as much
as I do.
