00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.302
In the last quiz, we transformed the function f of x equals x squared, into the

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:09.750
function f of x equals x squared minus 2. And we saw that the way this affects

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.046
our graph is, it moves it down by 2 units. We called this a vertical shift

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:18.142
downward. But remember, we're trying to help Athena with her function. And I'm

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:21.911
not sure yet if we're going to need to move things vertically. We do know,

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.737
however, that she's going to want to move her function horizontally. So why

00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:29.880
don't we try that for a second. So let's say that, once again, we start out

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.268
with the function, f of x equals x squared. This time however, I know that I

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:38.111
want to get a graph that's exactly the same as this one, but shifted over to

00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:44.533
the right by 3 units. What equation do I need for this new graph? Please write

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.709
it right here.
