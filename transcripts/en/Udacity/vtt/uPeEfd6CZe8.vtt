00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.180
Now that we humans find addressing problems like this almost trivial,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.590
we know what to do here. Put D on the table, put B on the table, and so on.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.790
And then put C on top of D and so on. The question is, how can we write an AI

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.850
program that can do it? And, by writing an AI program, how can we make things so

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.320
precise that that will provide insight into human intelligence. To do this,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740
let us start writing the operators that are available in this particular work.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.350
There are only two operators. I can either move block x to block y,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.000
which is the first operator here. Or I can move block x to the table.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.150
Note two things. First, instead of saying block A and block B,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.010
we have variabalized them, move block x to block y, where x could be A, B,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.850
C or D, and similary for block y. And this is just a more concised notation.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.590
Second, that in order to move block x to block y,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.800
both x and y must be clear. That is neither x nor

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.060
y should have any of the block on top of them. Given this setup, please write

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.510
down the specification of the first operator as well as the second operator.
