00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
All right, so let's see if we can refine that a little bit.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.970
We've already implemented from the last question a very naive vertex cover algorithm

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.960
that will basically check every single possible cover.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.620
Now, let's improve that by instead of checking just one vertex v,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.460
let's check two vertices--u and v that are still not assigned.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.050
Now, if no two such vertices can be found, we simply output the size

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.010
of the vertex cover implied by the current assignment.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.610
Now, there may still be vertices that are unassigned, but as we've discussed in the unit,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.840
there's a very straightforward way to tell if this should count as 1 or 0.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.570
If you're confused about this thing, I'd recommend going back and looking over the unit.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.880
What I'd like you to do then is simply add un right here and it starts off as just setting u=-1

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.740
and then add un to the logic here wherever you would then normally be just manipulating v.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.600
So you don't have to do a little bit of changing things around to check for other vertices

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.620
that are still unassigned and that's going to be a little complicated

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.020
but most of these should be relatively straightforward.

00:01:10.020 --> 99:59:59.000
So okay. Good luck and I hope you have fun with us.
