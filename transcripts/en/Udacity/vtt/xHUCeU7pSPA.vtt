00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.854
All of these questions can be answered with a simple term, learning. Learning

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:09.670
is defined as enduring changes in behavior that occur with experience. Learning

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.384
is fundamental to being successful in our environment. In this lesson, we're

00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:16.910
going to cover three distinct types of learning. First, we're going to look at

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.899
the classic, Pavlov's dog and classical conditioning. Then, we're going to look

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:24.839
at B. F. Skinner and his rats, and operant conditioning. And, finally, we're

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.480
going to look at Albert Bandura's Bobo doll study and social learning.
