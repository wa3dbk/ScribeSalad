00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.520
We've now completed our review of
data and interoperability standards.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.830
This is an immense field, and we've
only skimmed the surface in an effort to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.940
equip you with a working knowledge
of the areas being standardized,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.320
the approaches and technologies being
used, and the potential benefits.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.730
You should recognize that for
the most part health informatics

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.490
standards have been developed
within the industry and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.140
have only recently begun to adopt
approaches such as XML and web services.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.120
You should also appreciate
the inevitable attention

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.240
that exists between the need many feel
to create very detailed standards for

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.240
everything and
the complexity that creates.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.260
Often this complexity gets in
the way of the real objective,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.520
which is implementation and use of the
standards in day-to-day patient care.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.050
And the increasing recognition of that
seems to be leading to a new willingness

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.955
to look outside of healthcare and
to adopt more facile and

00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:01.520
easy-to-implement approaches,
such as FHIR.
