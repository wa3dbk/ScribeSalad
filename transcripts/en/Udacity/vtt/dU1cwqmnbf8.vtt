00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.715
So, here, once again, is our graph of the volume of a box versus the length of

00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:09.182
the cut that we put in it, to be able to fold the sides up. And clearly, the one

00:00:09.182 --> 00:00:12.878
that we have here is the restricted domain version, the one that Athena wanted,

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:16.684
because of the real life situation that she was using this in conjunction with.

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:21.402
However, let's take a second to look at the equation for this function. We had A

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:27.047
of x so you go to 7 minus 2X times 5 minus 2X times x. And you'll remember

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:32.046
earlier on, I multiplied all of these out. And when we do this all of this

00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:36.930
multiplication out, we get a different form, for expressing this function, 4x

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.754
cubed minus 24x squared plus 35x. And the reason I wanted multiplication out

00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:46.564
right now, so I think you might notice, this equation is pretty different from

00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:51.253
anything else that we've grasped so far in the course. In particular, we have an

00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:55.080
exponent of 3 in our function. What on earth does a graph that has a third

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.596
degree term in it look like? Well, why don't we get rid of these domain

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:02.250
restrictions briefly and zoom out, and look at the entire graph that this is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.745
part of. So, here's the full version of our function without any domain

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:10.540
restrictions. Multiply it out. The function, itself, is 4x cubed minus 24x

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.197
squared plus 35x. This is a totally different equation than anything we've dealt

00:01:15.197 --> 00:01:19.481
with before, graphically, at least, though we did see expressions that look like

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:23.153
this early on in the course. Because this function has a different degree than

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:26.377
other functions we've dealt with, it's going to have different graphical

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:30.248
properties as well. Now, I've labeled a few different special points on the

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:34.372
graph or points that may potentially be special. And I'd like you to help

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:38.610
identify what they are. So, in each of the purple boxes over here, to complete

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.390
the statements, I'd like you to fill in letters that go with these different

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.016
points. And there's this blue one right here, this, I'd like to be a number that

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:51.782
you just type in. So basically, I'm asking you which points are the x-intercept

00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:56.031
and how many are there? Where the function changes from increasing to

00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:59.816
decreasing, and when it changes from decreasing to increasing.
