00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.680
What do we do for crash recovery? Suppose the system

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.800
crashes and come back. Treat it just like an abort. Recover

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.975
the old image from the undo log. Remember that undo

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.460
log will survive crashes, because it is in the RIO file

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.170
cache. So if the system crashes and comes back up,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.030
you see there is an undo log. Take that undo log,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.330
apply it to the virtual address space that it corresponds

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.450
to. You're back in business again. Could there be a crash

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.270
during crash recovery? No problem with that. Because of idempotency of recovery,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.870
there's no problem in dealing with

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.080
crash that might happen during crash recovery.
