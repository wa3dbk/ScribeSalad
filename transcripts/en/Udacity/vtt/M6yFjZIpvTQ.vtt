00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.608
We know that we don't know how to get a solution within the real numbers, for

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:07.316
expressing the square root of a negative number. So that means it needs to go

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:10.915
outside of the real numbers, in what right now looks like a sort of no man's

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:14.428
land. I think that means that we actually need to define a new part of our

00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:14.933
diagram.
