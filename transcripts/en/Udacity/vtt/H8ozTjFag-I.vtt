00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.568
Let's see what this graph predicicts the population will be in 2013. I'll slide

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:11.737
my point down to the corerect X value. In 2013, it says there should be 3.2

00:00:11.737 --> 00:00:18.880
billion people. So is this an accurate prediction? The answer is no. We saw on

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.613
our chart earlier that by 2011 there were 7 billion people in the world. So,

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:28.951
this is greatly underestimating the total world population. Using only the

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.427
first two points in our chart doesn't actually predict very well what the

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:34.880
population ended up being.
