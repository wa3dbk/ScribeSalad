00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And now for our programming challenge, this is completely optional and is fairly challenging

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and requires a decent knowledge of programming but if you're up for a challenge

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and want to learn to do something fun, let's dive in.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We have a bag filled with coins. Each of these coins maybe a bit different.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This coin may have a probability of landing on heads of 0.5

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and this coin might have a probability of 0.1

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, I'm going to draw one coin from this bag and I'm going to flip it repeatedly and each time I flip it,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'd like you to tell me what your best guess is for the probability of it being heads on the next flip.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
To do this, we're going to write a program in Python.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What we're going to ask you to write is a Python class called flip predictor

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that's going to take the set of coins in the bag.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In this case, coins with probabilities of landing on heads of 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
then we're going to flip the coins several times.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
In this case, the results were heads, heads, tails, and heads.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
After every flip, we'll tell you what the result was and then we'll ask you to tell us

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
what the probability of heads will be the next time we flip the coin.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So to solve this, remember that Bayes' Rule tells us that the probability of the coin selected

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
being a given coin is equal to the probability of the flip being what it was that it's head or tails

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
given coin i times the probability of coin i being the coin divided by the probability

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
of the flip either heads or tails.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So now let's look at the code you're going to have to write.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So here we are back in the our editor

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
with an outline of the program you're going to have to write.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
First, we just make division work the way you'd expect it to work

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that is 1/2=0.5 so you don't have to think about it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Then we defined this thing called a class.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
If you aren't familiar of what a class is, don't worry, you're not going

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to actually have to do anything with the class.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We set up the class right here for you.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
A class is just a way of grouping functions and data those functions can use.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So here we just set up our data and that is we're given a set of coins in our bag and we just call that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
self.coins and so in these functions down here you're going to be able to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
access the coins in your bag as self.coins and that's going to be a Python list.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And then we create this new list called self.probs and that's just going to be a list

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
with the same number of items as in coins giving the probability that

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
each point in time of a coin being the coin selected.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
At first, since the coin was selected at random that probability is simply 1/n

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
so if there are three coins it's a third, if there are 10 coins it's a 10th.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So what I'd like you to do is fill in these two functions.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
P heads is a function that just returns the probability of heads right now.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So given your best guess of the current probabilities,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
what's the probability of coming up with heads?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And you can compute this using self.probs and self.coins.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Then for the slightly trickier part, I want you to write an update function and that's going to take

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
a result either in H or a T, and based on that result, you're going to update self.probs

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
so that p heads will return with the correct value in the future.

00:04:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Good luck! This is a very challenging problem. I hope you enjoy it.
