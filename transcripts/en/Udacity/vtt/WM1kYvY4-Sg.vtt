00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's go back to our list of concepts, go back to our diagram of where we were

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and say, "What should be the next step?" Well, what can we do now?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We can take a hand and we can take a single letter on the board and we can say,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
"Yes, I can pick letters out of the hand and maybe do a S-I-D-E."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That would be a good play, except if there was an X here, then it would not be a good play.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Similarly, if there were letters in the opposite direction, that could be a bad play.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But sometimes, there's letters in the opposite direction and it makes a good play.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Where here I'm forming two words at once, and the rules are the play I have to make

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
has to be all in one direction and all adjacent to each other so forming one consecutive word.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then if it incidentally forms some other words in the other directions, that's okay.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But I can't put some in this direction and then put some others down in that direction.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I think my next goal will be to place words on a row

00:00:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
while worrying about the crosswords in the opposite direction.
