00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.290
So from the Trait Theory perspective people have consistent and unique

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.645
dispositions for behaving and there are five major dimensions of personality,

00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:13.130
openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and nervousness or

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.290
neuroticism and recall also that traits lower our threshold for behaving in

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.320
particular ways and that these traits exists on a continuum from low on one

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.801
side to high on the other. And therefore we can plot any person's personality

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:35.749
on a graph, just as we have here. So here are my scores after taking the big

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:43.712
five personality test. So I was very high in openness to new experiences. I was

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:50.170
medium low on conscientiousness, a little bit closer to the disorganized side.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.552
I was medium high on extroversion. I was high, quite high, on agreeableness and

00:00:56.552 --> 00:01:00.776
I was also quite low on nervousness or another way of saying that would be high

00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:06.181
on calmness and relaxation. And the nice thing about this personality

00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:11.006
questionnaire is you can compare other people too. So Lauren, for instance,

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:16.753
took the same test. And here were her scores. We were very similar on openness

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:21.870
to experience. She was higher on conscientiousness, very high on extroversion,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.938
you might have gotten a sense that she's very extroverted. She's also a very

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:32.299
agreeable, medium high at least. And we're very similar on calmness, neither

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.230
one of us gets too nervous and high strung.
