00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.090
So we just looked at how we do simple queries

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.460
in MongoDB. If we to more precisely specify the form of

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.300
documents we're looking for, we can simply add additional fields

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.540
to our query document. Here's an example building on the last

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.860
one. So, again,manufacturer Toyota. In this case though, we're also

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.600
going to specify that we want to see documents where the

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.650
class field has been set to mid-size car. And let's run

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.135
this. Okay, now in this case, we can see manufacturer and

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:30.380
mid-size car have the correct values for the documents that have been retrieved.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.600
And again, if we were to scroll through, we'd see that for every document.
