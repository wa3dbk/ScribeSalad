00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.100
Whenever you're working with core data,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.400
a mysterious words start
showing up every now and then.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.720
Fault if you see log
messages about fault.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.000
Set your worries aside
it's not your fault and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.930
everything is okay,
before we explain what a fault is and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.830
why it makes core data such
a useful tool for iOS development.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.270
Let's go back to table views for
a second.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.380
A table view never loads
all the cells at once,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.460
that would be incredibly wasteful.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.950
Think of a fetch request that
returns one million objects and

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.310
you tried to display
them in a table view.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.050
Would one million cells
be created at once?

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.980
Of course not.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.910
A table view is smarter than that.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.170
The table view by using
its data source will only

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.600
load the cells that
are visible in a given moment.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.010
This means that cells are created
on a per need basis which

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.000
optimizes performance and memory usage.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.280
This is such a brilliant idea that it's
used in many other places in Coco,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.030
such as collection views.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.080
Let's take a look at one.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.490
When I scroll up and a cell disappears
it gets removed from memory.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.650
This is only the view but

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.590
wouldn't it be great to have the model
object being displayed in the cell,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.320
to be removed from memory
once it's not needed anymore?

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.510
That's exactly what core
data does by using folds.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.080
So hang on there and
we'll explain it in the next video.
