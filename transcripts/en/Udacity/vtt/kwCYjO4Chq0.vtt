00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.931
One way to solve this problem is to look at the graph and see that it's between

00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:09.378
10 and 11 hours that the graph drops below 5 bacteria. So, after 11 hours,

00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:13.471
there are fewer than 5 bacteria remaining. Now, if you wanted to get a more

00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:16.943
accurate answer, you could use the method like we used when we were finding

00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:22.198
zeros using the intermediate value theorem. You could plug in two values of t

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:25.852
into the function that you can tell on either side of the point we're looking

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:31.625
for. So maybe like, t equals 15 and t equals 5. Then you could zoom in closer

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:36.889
and closer to the point by considering smaller and smaller intervals in time.

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:41.299
But this is really time-consuming. If only there were a quicker method.
