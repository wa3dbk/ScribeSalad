Okay.

00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:03.959
Let's try out our order of operations with a quiz. Here's the problem, and I

want you to tell me its value. You can put your answer in this box here.

00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:10.868
Remember, if you don't get the question right the first time around, ask

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.700
yourself, are you making the right choices based on the priority of the order of

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:15.245
operations?
