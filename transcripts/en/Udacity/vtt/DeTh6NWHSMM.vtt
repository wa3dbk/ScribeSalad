00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.188
Well, they're actually both right, let's see why. Let's look at the blue code

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:10.940
first. When we start, the value is 100. We go to the loop, value is greater or

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.600
equal than 100. In fact, we've set it, to make sure we enter the loop. We ask

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.534
the user to enter a value. Let's say the user is uncooperative and enters 200,

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:28.620
then we go back up. Now, the value is still greater or equal than 100. And we

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.544
go back in the loop. That was the whole purpose really, of this while loop. We

00:00:31.544 --> 00:00:35.574
wanted to keep asking the user while the value is greater equal than 100, since

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:40.798
our target is to get a value less than 100. Remember, the while condition is

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:45.740
always the opposite of the target. So now, let's say the user is doing better,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.081
enters 99. I'll go back to the top of the loop. 99 is less than 100. And we

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:56.664
follow through, so it worked. So this one was a good solution. Now, let's look

00:00:56.664 --> 00:01:01.205
at the black solution. This one is a little different, we ask the user to enter

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:08.244
a value less than 100 and let's say they do, then now comes the loop. This loop

00:01:08.244 --> 00:01:13.450
is never entered. And in this case we get the right behavior. So, let's look at

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.993
another situation where the user doesn't makes a mistake first. So, we're again

00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:24.987
at the top. We ask the user to enter a value less than 100. The user enters

00:01:24.987 --> 00:01:29.158
200. Now, that's greater or equal with N100, So now, we get into the loop and

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:33.765
we ask the user again and say no if they give the right answer. Then we go back

00:01:33.765 --> 00:01:37.446
to the top and now we're satisfied, so this also works. But both of the

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:42.200
solutions are a little unsatisfactory. Look at the first one here. We have this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.720
trick where we're setting the value to an artificial value not to a user input

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.572
so that we enter the loop the first time, it's a bit ugly. The second one we

00:01:51.572 --> 00:01:56.182
repeat part of the code. Look at this statement here and the statements here,

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:59.350
they're exactly the same statements and we need to repeat them because we first

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.564
need to get the user input before we can see whether it's any good. And then,

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:08.863
we need to keep bugging the user until it's any good. That repetition is also,

00:02:08.863 --> 00:02:13.084
somewhat undesirable. There is a Java statement that can take care of this

00:02:13.084 --> 00:02:14.159
issue.
