00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.270
So I started as a pilot
in the Israeli Air Force,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.550
which is a very entrepreneurial place.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.854
When I finished that, I started my
first company and like many of them,

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:11.190
it was not very successful.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.994
And then I started my second company
which luckily was more successful which

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:18.275
I sold many years ago,
talking about close to 20 years ago now.

00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:21.792
After that I started my
journey to the dark side and

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:27.580
moved to become an executive in
the company that acquired my company.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.911
Moved on there up to being a CEO, then
became the CEO of another company and

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:32.273
then built another company.

00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:33.706
Last company I ran for

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:39.740
five years was a publicly traded company
in London called 888 Gaming Company.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.253
Around 1500 people
dealing with internet and

00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:45.319
started investing in companies or
11 years ago as a hobby.

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.710
A friend came to me with
an idea I really like the idea.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.235
I gave him a bit of money and
the lot of advice and then after a year,

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:56.539
I got a big fat check and
I said well I can do that.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:57.790
I love that.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.540
And so I took all that money and
I decided I'm going to reinvest it in

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.090
other companies and I was very lucky
in that some of the companies I chose

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.400
became more successful and
so I continued with it.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.479
And so over the years,
I invested in quite a few companies.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.210
And then when I left my last corporate
role five years ago, I decided that it's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.296
going to be a good idea to not take
another big ugly corporate role and

00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:23.401
instead of it just stick to
the entrepreneurship and investments.

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.080
And that's what I've been
doing the last five years.
