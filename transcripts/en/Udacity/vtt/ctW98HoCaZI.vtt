00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.520
To get started, let's answer the question,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.550
what is information visualization? Information visualization is

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.430
the effective communication of complex quantitative ideas.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.310
This is usually done through geometry and

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.540
color. What do we mean by an

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.490
effective communication? Well, an effective communication is

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.180
the expression of ideas with clarity, precision,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.150
and efficiency. An effective visualization will let

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
you see things that might go unnoticed if you

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.500
didn't visualize the data. Any data set contains tons of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.490
information but you might missed out on trends, behavior

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.150
patterns, and dependencies if you don't visualize it. Additionally, an

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.060
effective visualization can highlight certain trends in the data

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.090
or tell a story to people who might be looking

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.120
at the visualization. So why don't we take a look

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.200
at an all time classic visualization of information, Charles Minard's

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.670
graphical depiction of the terrible fate of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.640
Napoleon's army when they marched on Russia.
