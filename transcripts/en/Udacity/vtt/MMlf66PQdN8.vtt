00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.740
The most well-known heuristic for

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.860
graph partitioning is
the Kernighan-Lin algorithm.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.730
By the way,
the g in Kernighan is silent.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.830
That's gnu as in the wildebeest,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.470
not the the free software thing,
which has a hard g, as in ga-nu.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.858
So it's gnu, not ga-nu.

00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:17.120
Got it?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.010
The idea behind the K-L
algorithm is simple.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.990
Given a graph, divide the vertices
into two subsets of equal or

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.930
nearly equal size.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.520
Yes.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.570
Any split will do.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.620
I'm serious, any one you want.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.200
It's okay.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.470
Go ahead.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.000
Oh, for goodness sake,
just pick a partition already!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.200
Let's define the cost of this
partitioning to be the number of edges

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.800
that go between V1 and V2.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.590
Now imagine that a magic bean hands you
two equal sized subsets of V1 and V2.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.040
Let's call these subsets X1 and X2.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.150
Imagine that you were to
swap these two subsets.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.880
Naturally you would expect
the cut size to change.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.460
But by how much?

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.430
To answer this question in a formal way,
let's start with some definitions.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.380
Consider one vertex, let's call it a,
which lives on one side of a partition.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.250
Define its external cost
as the number of edges that

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.320
land in the other partition.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.140
In this cartoon,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.870
a's external cost, denoted E 1
of a is equal to three edges.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.870
To find a similar external cost, E 2 of
b for any vertex b that lives in V 2.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.300
Next, define the notion
of an internal cost.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.540
The internal cost will count
the number of edges from a vertex to

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.450
other vertices that live
in the same partition.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.110
&gt;From these definitions, you can write
down the cost of a partition as follows.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.090
It's the cost of the partition, ignoring
a and b, plus the external cost of a,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.810
the external cost of b,
and minus some constant.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.600
So what's this constant?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.060
You need that constant to account for
a possible edge between a and b.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.940
The constant is one if there's
an edge there and zero otherwise.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.900
But why subtract it?

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.950
That is a terrific question and
you should take a moment to ponder it.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.410
Now suppose you swap a and b.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.080
What's the new cost?

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.810
Well, any edge that was
incident on a that was

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.690
previously external is now internal.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.370
Same thing goes for b.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.190
So to get the new cost, let's start
with the old cost, ignoring a and b, and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.220
then add some adjustments.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.740
The adjustments involve
the internal costs of a and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.130
b plus the constant again.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.630
Hey, what's with the plus constant, now?

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.230
Now let's look at the change in cost.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.960
That's the old cost minus the new cost.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.010
After some algebra, you get this.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.430
The larger this change,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.400
the better, because it means
a larger decrease in the cost.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.510
Let's call this cost the gain
from swapping a and b.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.296
By the way,

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:48.386
do you see that it's possible that
gain of ab could actually be negative?
