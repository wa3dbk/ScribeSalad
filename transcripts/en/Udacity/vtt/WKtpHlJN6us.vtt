00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.040
Another problem that arises when reading state,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.390
is that ,extra unexpected events may introduce

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.420
inconsistencies. A common programming idiom, is that,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.220
the first packet goes to the controller

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.840
and once the controller figures out what policy to apply for that flow, the

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.790
controller then installs rules in the switches,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.540
in the network, corresponding to that flow.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.390
What if more packets should arrive ,at the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.230
switch before the controller has a chance to install

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.050
rules for that flow? At this point, multiple

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.170
packets may reach the controller, but the application It

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.270
is running on top of the controller, may

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.600
not need or want to see these additional packets.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.940
So, the solution, is to have the programmer specify

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.410
by a high level language a limit of one,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.320
indicating that the application should only see

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.590
the first packet of the flow and that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.330
the subsequent packet should be suppressed. The

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.690
runtime system then hides the extra events. So

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570
to remind you where we are, we

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.240
talked about problems with consistency when reading state

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.495
from the network, and we talked about ,three

00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:17.790
approaches to, helping guarantee consistency when reading state.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.270
Predicates, rule unfolding and suppression. And let's now talk

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.090
about primitives that can help maintain consistency, when writing State.
