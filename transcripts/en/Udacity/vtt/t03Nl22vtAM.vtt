00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.820
The upshot of bundling the IPC and recovery management is that a service

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.880
can safely collect all the breadcrumbs it left behind in all the places that it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.610
touched through the course of its service.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.138
Examples of such breadcrumbs include memory that

00:00:18.138 --> 00:00:21.666
was allocated but not reclaimed, file handles,

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.362
communication handles, or often windows that have

00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:28.227
been created on the display. All of these

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:30.712
are breadcrumbs that may be left behind by

00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:33.634
failed clients or servers. And the fact that

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.742
you have a transaction tree that records the

00:00:36.742 --> 00:00:39.514
trail of all the nodes that were touched

00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:42.706
and the temporary states that were created in

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:45.982
all these nodes allows these breadcrumbs to be

00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:50.462
cleanly reclaimed. And there is no extra communication for

00:00:50.462 --> 00:00:54.202
the recovery management itself, because whatever

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:58.112
communication is needed for the transaction managers

00:00:58.112 --> 00:01:03.807
to talk to one another in participating in the transaction that is shadowing the

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:09.288
IPC, actually rides on the IPC itself, and therefore it comes for free.

00:01:09.288 --> 00:01:12.919
And Quicksilver only provides the mechanisms. The

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:16.020
policy is entirely up to each service.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.110
And in fact, services can simply ignore these

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.370
mechanisms if they don't need any recovery management,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.660
or choose a policy that is commensurate with

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.890
the type of service that it is providing.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.696
Because there's a variety of mechanisms available in

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:33.441
the operating system, simple services may choose to

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:38.060
use low-overhead mechanisms. Whereas a more involved service

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.650
such as a file server may use weighty mechanisms

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.810
in order to recover from failures. The

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.530
overhead for recovery management in Quicksilver is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.840
very similar to what we already saw

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.512
in LRVM. The transaction managers have to write

00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:56.510
log records at every one of these

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.182
nodes. Because they are handling the interactions

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:02.954
between clients or servers at this node

00:02:02.954 --> 00:02:06.902
with respect to other sites, the transaction managers

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:08.918
have to write log records for

00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:13.708
recovering persistent state. Similar to LRVM, Quicksilver

00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:16.284
also uses in-memory logs for the

00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:20.860
transaction managers. And these transaction managers flush

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.600
the in-memory logs that they create

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.440
to record persistent states to disk periodically.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.120
How often these in-memory log records are written out to the disk by

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.080
the transaction manager is a performance factor,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.240
and it is a window of vulnerability just

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.990
as in LRVM. Ideally, if you want to be absolutely sure that you can recover from

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.630
failures, whenever any persistent state is modified and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.560
a log record is written by the transaction

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.270
manager, that log record should be committed to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.910
the storage. But that costs synchronous I/O, and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.420
so if you're worried about that, you might want to do

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.640
that more opportunistically, assuming there are not going to be too

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.210
many failures. So there is a performance vulnerability trade off in

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.170
how often the transaction manager writes log records to the storage device.
