00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.380
So one thing that's really interesting to note here, is that, the remainder

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.942
that we got, when we divided x cubed minus 4 x squared plus x plus 6 by x minus

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:11.590
1, is the same as the number that we got when we plugged 1 in for x in this

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.837
function. That's pretty interesting. This would be a pretty incredible

00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:23.754
coincidence, if it weren't actually caused by something. You'll also remember

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:27.943
that, when we plugged in 2 to our function, we ended up with 0, and we know

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:32.610
that x minus 2 is a factor, so if we divided by x minus 2, we would get 0 as a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.895
remainder. Seems like remainders in the numbers we get, when we plug in

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:41.678
different values for a function, are very closely connected. Let's keep going

00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:45.517
with this idea. So, what will the remainder be if we divide the function we've

00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:49.990
been working with, instead, by x plus 3? Think for a second about what to do.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.746
And now, I'll give you a hint. Why don't you see what happens if you just find

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:57.428
f of negative 3. You can still think about the connection we were seeing

00:00:57.428 --> 00:01:01.513
before, between remainders and plugging numbers into the function. And then if

00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:04.163
you want to, double check by doing the long division.
