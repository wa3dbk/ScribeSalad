00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
Let us do an exercise together to make
sure that we get rich solutions for

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.770
improving.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.310
So consider this sentence
if an animal has wings and

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.010
does not have fur, it is a bird.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.160
Write this sentence
down in formal logic.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.171
You can use the predicates,
has-wings, has-fur, and bird.
