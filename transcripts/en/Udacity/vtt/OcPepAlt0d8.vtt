00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, here's my answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I do is I make a variable called markers,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is going to be a bunch of strings of the format of 'markers = %s, %s',

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
substituting in the lat and long for p and points.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then we're going to join those together with an ampersand,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then we're just going to append that to the base URL. Simple enough.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay, if I were to run this with just a single point, it still needs to be in a list.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Our function is still expecting a list but one point.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Make up some fake coordinates here and give this a run.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We see that this also works just fine-- "markers=100,200',

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and there's this one markers parameter.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.039
Let's go ahead and use this in our program.
