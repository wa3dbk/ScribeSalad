00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.980
Let's also look at examples of what focal length does in terms of

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.350
what viewpoint do you want to capture.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.550
Here I'm showing two examples.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.950
Again, our two friends that have come visited us before, and

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.360
here I've basically shown two images.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.340
This image was captured with a focal length of 18 millimeter on

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.960
a 35 millimeter sensor.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.940
That was a full frame camera.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.620
Distance to the first subject is half a meter, and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.710
distance to the second subject was two meters.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.120
In this case, I used a focal length ten times as larger 180mm.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.100
Again, the same camera.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.560
And, the distance to the first subject is no longer 0.5,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.090
but I moved 2.5 meters away.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.856
And, of course, that meant the distance to the second subject is also now

00:00:45.856 --> 00:00:48.170
2.5 meters more, 4.5.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.480
Exactly the same scene,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.070
shot by two different focal lengths with the same camera.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.470
And you can note this that each one of them has a different impact.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.210
What this shows is that changing the focal length allows us to move back and

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.740
still capture the entire scene.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.040
But, of course, changing this form of a viewpoint also does change

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.240
a perspective change.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.330
For example,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.500
these two scientists are appearing to be actually much closer than they are.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.620
They are actually almost 1.5 meter apart.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.420
But by looking at this image, you can't tell.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.880
They almost look to be sitting next to each other.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.530
One of the best ways to kind of visualize this is to see the vertigo effect.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.450
I recommend you look it up on YouTube.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.809
But this kind of scene perspective tricks are widely used in

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:37.777
movies like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where you could see Gandalf and

00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:42.041
Frodo sitting next to each other, but looking much different sizes.

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:46.337
Of course, there's still approximately same human size, but

00:01:46.337 --> 00:01:48.495
in case Frodo looks much shorter.

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:52.988
And this is exactly the kinds of tricks that were done in movies like this,

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:55.234
by basically moving farther away and

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:59.809
using a high-focal length lens to kind of show them to be different sizes.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.020
So this is the kind of tricks again that are widely used in movie industry.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.610
But just by changing the focal length we can actually change the perspective

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.195
and the viewpoint.
