00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.639
Now for this next task, what we'd like you to do is actually hook up mousemove

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.199
and keydown to proper listener events. So that we can receive and then respond

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:12.928
to those two actions appropriately. Now remember, the proper syntax to add an

00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:17.276
event listener is as such. Make sure you utilize this while filling out your

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:21.150
code. Now for mousemove, the event object itself will contain two properties

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.008
that you'll need to use. The client x and client y values represent the

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.293
position of the mouse on the canvas itself not on the webpage. So make sure you

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:33.460
take that into account. The onKeyDown event, instead of containing a clientX

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.417
and clientY, contains a keyID property.
