00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.100
Branches happen on a single repository.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.080
Of course, you can push and pull branches, but when you create one,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.490
you're creating it on one single repository, so

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.960
the only one that could possibly fit that mold is this one.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.150
We have one branch and here we've got a second branch.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.410
So this one is a branch.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.810
Cloning involves taking an existing repository and making one just like it.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.850
The original repository could either be remote, like in this case, so

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.440
here we cloned from GitHub to local.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.180
Or you could even clone a local repository into another spot on your computer.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.660
We haven't really talked about this, so this one was probably a little tricky.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.770
This one looks a lot like a clone too, but

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.660
remember, we are cloning our repository from GitHub onto GitHub.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.880
You do that using GitHub's built-in fork feature.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.830
Forking is only used within the context of GitHub, taking an existing GitHub

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.540
repository and making a copy of it, whereas clone works on any two repositories.
