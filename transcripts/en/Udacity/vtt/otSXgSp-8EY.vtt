00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.680
So let's see what pipelining is about. So let's

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.055
say we have discovered oil somewhere very far away and

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:09.796
we have a gas station somewhere. And now we

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:12.568
take a bucket of oil, give it to somebody to

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:16.312
carry. Three days later, they are here and they

00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:19.570
pour the bucket of oil here. Now we have a

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.450
quarter of a tank of oil. So we need

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.180
to do this about four times. It's going to take ten

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:32.110
days probably for us to have enough oil to fill the car. So clearly, the guy

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.670
with the bucket approach is not working well for us. What does work, you have

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.100
a long pipe and you start pumping some oil into the pipe. The front part of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.446
the oil moves through the pipe. Takes it

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:50.170
several days to travel and after three days,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.360
we get the bucket of oil here. So, what's the big deal? The latency is still

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.484
three days. The big deal is that after

00:00:58.484 --> 00:01:01.774
we have filled the first bucket three days

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:08.600
after we send the oil, the second bucket of oil comes right after it. So, pretty

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.004
much, once we fill this pipeline with oil,

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:15.224
we pump some oil here, and we keep pumping

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:18.910
oil in and the oil keeps coming out. So

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.510
the rate at which oil is coming out is going to

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.130
be many buckets per day, although it takes three

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.935
days for the first bucket to get there. So the

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:31.661
idea of pipelining really is that although the latency

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:34.334
is long for one unit of oil to get there,

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:37.331
we can be having many units of oil in progress

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.490
so that when one comes out, we can very quickly

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.510
get the next one and the next one and so on. Pretty much we are not

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.870
moving buckets one at a time. There is

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.680
many, many buckets traveling at the same time.
