00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 6370.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In order for this to work, well, we need a mapping.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We need encryption to be invertible.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Given that the output is mod n,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we have output values that the possible values here

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
would be from 0 to n - 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We need to know that this mapping

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
maps each message to a unique cipher text, otherwise they wouldn't be invertible.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If 2 messages map to the same value,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
then we wouldn't know which to decrypt to.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That would definitely be the case if we have more than the modulus number of values.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That would mean that we've wrapped around and we've definitely used one at least twice.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But as long as m and n are relatively prime,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we should generate all the different values, so we can use each of these as

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
different messages, but we should be very careful.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What if the value m is 0?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If m is 0 no matter what the exponent is,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we still get 0 as our result.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That's not a very good encryption function if the result doesn't depend on the key.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The same thing if m is 1.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We still get 1 as the output, and in fact,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
it's dangerous for any small value to use this encryption.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And one reason you can see that--and we'll talk more about this later--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is the key is public.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We're assuming that the adversary knows e,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
so if there's only a small possible set of m values,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the adversary can just try them all and see which one maps,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so it's very dangerous to use a small m as the input message for RSA.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We'll talk more about that later,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but first I want to talk about why RSA is correct

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and then why we think it's secure,

00:01:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
at least when it's used in a very careful way.
