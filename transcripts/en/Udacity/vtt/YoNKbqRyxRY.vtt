00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.220
An interesting application of MapReduce and these design patterns

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.010
is making top N record lists. These are especially useful

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.240
if you work at a company like BuzzFeed. But even

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.370
if you don't, you still might want to use these. And

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.640
in this question we're going to, in particular, find the top

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.190
ten longest forum posts. Now, with a relational data base

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.880
management system you just first sort your data. In this

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.810
case forum posts. And then pick the top N records.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.840
But with MapReduce, this just won't work. The

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.100
data isn't sorted and it's processed in several machines.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.100
So, instead, what we're going to have to do

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.640
is have each mapper generate a top N list

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.700
and then send these local lists to the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.480
reducers who can then find the global top N.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.480
It's sort of like what happens in the Olympics. If

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.830
you want to find the top three I don't know,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.330
swimmers, every country needs to send their top three swimmers

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.320
to the Olympics. And then, through a competition, figure who globally

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.372
the top three swimmers are. Anyways, let's go ahead and find

00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:08.220
the top ten longest forum posts in the Udacity forum data.
