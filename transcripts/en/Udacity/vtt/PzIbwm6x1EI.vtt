00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.570
Okay, so I hope that wasn't too bad, there are only a few errors that you needed

00:00:04.582 --> 00:00:09.035
to spot. let's go through them one at a time. The first one is right here, you

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:13.725
can see that this is opened with an opened square bracket, but it's closed with

00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:18.557
an angle bracket, and this should be a square bracket right here. Now, the next

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:23.362
error is right down here and this is missing a semicolon after the

00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:28.058
first section of the for loop. Now, the next error we'd like to point out is this

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.403
if statement right here. We need parentheses around this not entity clause.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:35.098
Let's go ahead and add those in.
