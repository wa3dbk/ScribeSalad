Let's look at the code that I wrote to do this. Here's all that stuff that we

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:07.418
had to do just to make the computer happy. And then here's the interesting

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:13.486
part. I wanted to print on two lines, so I used system out print line twice. On

00:00:13.486 --> 00:00:19.000
the first line, I wanted to print hello, so I put hello in quotes. And I passed

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.533
it out to system out print By putting it in the parentheses. On the second

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:26.986
line, I want it to print out world, so I write world in quotes and again, put

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:33.187
it in the parentheses. To run this in the Udacity IDE, I just copy this. I'm

00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:40.324
going to use Cmd+C or Ctrl+C depending on whether I'm on a Mac or a PC. And

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:48.183
then I'm going to go to the Udacity IDE and I'm going to paste it in. Now I can

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:57.520
test run it. And like I expected it prints hello and world on separate lines.
