00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.610
First, I'll use git status to recall what's currently in the staging area.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.435
I've added my lesson_1_reflections to be committed.

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.260
I'll go ahead and commit those using git commit and

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.560
I'll enter the commit message, Add lesson 1 reflections.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.490
Now I want to commit my lesson_2_reflections, so I'll add those and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.490
then run git commit again.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.720
Now that all my changes are committed, the result of git status is that I

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.410
have nothing to commit and my working directory is clean.
