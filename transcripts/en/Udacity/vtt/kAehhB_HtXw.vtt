00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
And of course, once you have the complete table, then you also have found the solution to knapsack

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.230
because once you have the complete table, you just start out in the right-most column

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.030
and then go to the left, to the left, to the left, to the left, and each time, you look through each column

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.980
and find what is the minimum size that I would need to achieve exactly this value

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.520
and once you find a size that is at most as large as your container you would be done.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.990
So constructing this table here solves knapsack.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.080
Now, my question, the second quiz is of course the time required to build this table.

00:00:33.080 --> 99:59:59.999
Is that time 2^n given that we have n objects here, is that time O(2^nn) or is that time O(nv)?
