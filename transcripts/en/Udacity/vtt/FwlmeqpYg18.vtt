00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.890
So now we know how to provide the daily
special in different languages.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.290
But how do we take the user's
food preference into account?

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.880
That doesn't seem to be a predefined
variable for food preference.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.600
They might be vegan,
they might prefer fish.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.070
We want to show them a special
that suits their taste.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.570
So we're going to use
the tag manager's data layer.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.050
Your app can put values in the data
layer by setting data layer variables.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.030
Then, tag manager can get
the values from the data layer.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.450
And use them to figure out which
variable values for your app to use.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.560
So now I'm going to look
specifically at the daily special.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.890
So the user chooses a food preference,
and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.020
the app can put that preference in
the food preferable in the data lay out.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.400
And then, the triggers in the tag
manager can use a data layer variable.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.160
To determine which
variable value to use for

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.590
your app to display the daily special.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.019
So if the food pref is to prefer meat,
you get a meat special.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.490
If you prefer fish,
you get a fish special.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.440
If you want vegetarian,
you get a veggie special.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.260
And if you chose vegan, well,
you get a vegan special.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.060
Let's go find out how to
make our app do this.
