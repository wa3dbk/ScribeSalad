00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.810
Let's do another quiz related to Amdahl's Law.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.380
We still have our instruction types of integer,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.398
branch, load, and store. Let's say now that

00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:12.006
the percentage of execution time we spent on each

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:19.131
is 40% for integer, 20% on branches, 30% on loads, 10% on stores. And the CPI,

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:21.770
we get for then is one for integer,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.590
four branches, two for loads, and three for stores.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.329
We have a processor that is clocked at two GHz. Let's say we are considering the

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.418
possible improvements that are reducing the branch CPI

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:40.037
from four to three. Increase the clock frequency

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:46.120
of the processor from two GHz to two point three GHz. And reducing the store CPI

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.620
from three to two. Assuming we can only do one of these, which would you choose

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.010
according to the overall speed?
