00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.729
Try this fourth problem out. Now, I know this looks really complicated. But it's

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.646
just about a cylindrical tank. This cylindrical tank is going to hold gasoline

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:13.532
in it. The number of gallons in this tank varies directly with the height and

00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:17.732
the square of this radius. See if you can set up the correct proportion to

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:22.284
relate the number of gallons, the height, and the square of the radius. Use all

00:00:22.284 --> 00:00:26.119
this information in the problem to figure the new height of the gasoline level

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.663
if these other conditions are true. Good luck.
