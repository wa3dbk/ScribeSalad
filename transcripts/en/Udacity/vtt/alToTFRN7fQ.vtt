00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.420
Let me give you a very quick refresher on encryption. There are two families of

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.940
encryption systems. One is the private key cryptosystem. And in the private key

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.830
cryptosystem both the sender and the receiver sse symmetric keys for encryption

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.160
of the data and decryption of the data. A common private key system that we all

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.950
are using probably on an every day basis is passwords. When we log

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.170
into either a corporate network or a university network. We use a username

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.400
and password and that is using a private key encryption systems. The

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.270
idea is simple. The sender takes the data that they want to

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.480
send a receiver and encrypts the data using a key and this key

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.890
is a private key that is known only

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.760
to the sender and the receiver space and nobody

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.490
else. So by encrypting the data with this key

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.950
they produce what is called a cyphertext and the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.140
cyphertext can go on insecure links. Anybody can see

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.930
the bit pattern of the cyphertext, but in order

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.900
to make sense out of the cyphertext they have

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.610
to decrypt it. And to decrypt it they need

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.420
the key and the key is only available between the sender and the receiver. So

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.060
this is where Salsa's principle comes into play.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.800
That is, publish the design, but protect the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.450
key. The keys are protected between the sender

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.590
and the receiver. You're publishing the method by

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.500
which you are transfering information between sender and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.000
receiver. Namely, using a private key encryption system.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.920
But, for any bad guy to access information that is flowing on the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.890
wire they have to have the key in order to make sense out

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.670
of the data that is flowing. And you make breaking the key hard

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.860
enough, computationally, that the system is secure. Now

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.070
one of the problems with the private key system is the fact that the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.889
keys have to be distributed to the

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.390
sender and the receiver and key distribution problem

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.125
is one of the difficulties with private key

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:18.570
cryptosystems. Especially as the size of the organization

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.602
becomes larger and larger. The public key cryptosystem

00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:25.680
overcomes this key distribution problem. And in this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.720
case there is a public key which is

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.320
published. The name itself suggests the idea behind

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.000
the public key cryptosystem. And that is, anyone

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.910
can create an encrypted data by taking this public

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.590
key, which is available, let's say published in the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.810
Yellow Pages. They can take the public key, take

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.290
the data that they want to send and encrypt it, and send it on the wire. But

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.560
in order to decrypt the data. The public key

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.960
is no good. You need a private key that

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.370
is the only way to decrypt this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.850
data. Well, in other words, the mathematical underpinning

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.970
of the public key cryptosystem is that there

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.420
are asymmetric keys, a pair of keys for

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.650
information exchange. In order to encrypt you use

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.960
a key that is a public key. Anybody

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.920
can have access to that. But in order to decrypt that, you need a private key.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.500
And, conversion of data into a cyphertext using the public key

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.520
is a one-way function, which is not reversible. Similarly, converting the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.472
encrypted message into the original data using the private key is another

00:03:43.472 --> 00:03:48.992
one-way function. So one-way functions are the mathematical basis for the

00:03:48.992 --> 00:03:55.810
public key cryptosystem. So now, the way you would send data, if you're the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.190
sender, take the data, encrypt it using

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.710
the public key. You create a cyphertext. Once

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.901
you have the cyphertext, you cannot convert it back to the data using the public

00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:11.140
key. The only entity that can convert

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.690
the cyphertext back to its original data is

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.120
the entity that has the private key.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.620
The other part of this asymmetric key infrastructure,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.800
namely, the private key and using the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.510
private key, you can decrypt the cyphertext and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.610
create the original data. So this is the workflow for a sender to encrypt the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.600
data, clear the cypher text, send it

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.780
to the receiver, receiver decrypts it using the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.410
private key, and produces the original data.
