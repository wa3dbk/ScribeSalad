00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.441
Now let us suppose that the AI
program had background knowledge,

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:07.620
which said that brick is a kind of block
and wedge is a kind of block as well.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.610
In that case, the AI program may
use this background knowledge to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.790
further revise this current concept
definition and replace this brick or

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.390
wedge by a block, because both bricks
and wedges are examples of blocks.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.880
So we'll call this
a climb-tree heuristic.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.730
Here is a tree of background knowledge,
we're climbing the tree.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.190
Note another interesting aspect of this.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.280
Suppose that there was under the kind of
block that was possible, say a cylinder.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.780
So now that the AI program has
generalized from brick and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.100
wedge into a block, and
this is the current definition.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.720
If a new example comes along and
it has a cylinder at the top here,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.470
that would be covered by
this particular concept.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.695
And this AI program would be able to
recognize that particular instance which

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:58.390
had the cylinder at the top as
an example of this concept definition.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.130
That is the power of being able to use
this background knowledge to generalize.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.810
The more we know, the more we can learn.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.010
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like this is actually
an example of what I was doing earlier.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.898
I had said that because
I saw a brick and

00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:14.800
a cylinder both playing the same role,
that they were both examples of block.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.880
And therefore,
any block could play that role.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.830
Then when I saw that funny kind of
little arch shape holding up

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.075
the block on top, I inferred that
that would also be an acceptable

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:25.800
answer because both brick and
cylinders were blocks.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.840
And I generalized out to say
any block could play that role.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.880
&gt;&gt; Good connection, David.
