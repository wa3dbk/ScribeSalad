00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.010
This question concerns the abstractions that is

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.109
available in Nucleus. Remember Nucleus is the microkernel

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.120
of Spring. And the question asks, what is

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.200
the difference between the primitives, or the abstractions

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.690
available in Nucleus, and Liedtke's prescription for

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.946
what a microkernel should look like? And these

00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:22.910
are the features that I am talking about.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.518
The first feature is the abstraction of threads,

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:30.390
second is interprocess communication, and the third is address space.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.838
And what I want you to do is fill this table

00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:35.862
in terms of, what are the abstractions that I have

00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:38.094
mentioned here available in Nucleus

00:00:38.094 --> 00:00:41.220
versus Liedtke's prescription for a microkernel
