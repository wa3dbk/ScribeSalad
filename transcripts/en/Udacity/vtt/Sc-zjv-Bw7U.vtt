00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.427
Here are our answers. Equation e, would shift our graph up by 6 units, that's

00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:09.130
why we have a plus 6 outside the original function. And if you want to shift

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.272
down instead, you need to subtract. In this case, we're subtracting by 1 with

00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:18.680
equation d. Equation c, which of the graph left by five units since we're

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.570
adding to x. And graph a would do essentially the opposite, it would shift the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.226
graph right, this time, by four units. Finally, graph b here, f of x equals

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:33.036
negative x squared, represents that reflection in the x-axis of the original

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:38.212
graph. This negative sign out in front of the original function takes all of

00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:41.740
the function values of the original graph and flips them across the x-axis,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.339
makes them negative.
