00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We see that this regular expression starts with an unmodified "a".

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we can rule out immediately any of these strings at the bottom that start with a "b".

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
They're not going to match it. The first letter has to be an "a".

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So we have an "a," and then remember that open parenthesis, question mark, colon,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and close parenthesis are a Python syntax loosely just meaning open and close parentheses.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So we've got an "a" followed by zero or more copies of "a? b*".

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"B*" can be no b's, and this " * " can be once,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so this could be "a?" or just "aa," so yeah, we can match that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
How about this, "aab"? Same strategy as before except that we make this "b*" be one "b".

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We can match this "abab"--"a", "b." We'll take one of these and then we'll repeat this whole group once.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This time, we'll take the "a" that we really want and one more "b". Yeah, we can match this.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
"Abbabb", "a". We'll skip over this optional "a?". We will have this "*" be twice.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We'll repeat the whole thing. We'll include the optional "a?".

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We will have this "*" be twice and now we're done. Yeah, we can match that.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And then finally here, just like the previous string, but we want one more "a" at the end.

00:01:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Well, we'll take the outermost loop one more time. Take this. Not take the star.
