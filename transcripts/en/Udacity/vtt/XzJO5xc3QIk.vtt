00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.600
So the answer is none of the above and we'll

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.460
see why in a minute. First I want to mention

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.790
that all of these are sort of real words. It's

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.920
not that well defined what it means for something to be

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.010
a word. The first one is the longest word used

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.800
by Shakespeare. This is 27 letters long and it means

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.280
roughly, with honor. The second one is one letter longer.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.970
It means the movement against the division of church and state.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.240
The third one, which is 35 letters long,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.300
means fear of long words. You can see it's

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.390
made up of phobia, which is fear and a

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.740
really big sort of made up root about things

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.250
being big and words. So it's fear of long

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.370
words. The fourth one is the longest word in

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.570
most large dictionaries. It's a kind of lung disease

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.730
that you get from having contact with volcanic particles.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.320
So, the reason the answer is none of the above

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.520
is that I'm very confident whatever you claim is the longest

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.550
word, I can alwauys make a bigger one. There is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.519
no such thing as the longest word in the English language.
