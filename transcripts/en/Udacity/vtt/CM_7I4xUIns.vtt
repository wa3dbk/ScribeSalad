Okay, so to share videos and photos, I

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.170
will click on the Discussion thread with a star.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.990
Now, the star means that I created this thread

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.090
for you to submit your responses. Once the discussion

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.379
forum has opened, you can simply scroll down

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.550
and add a YouTube link right here to the

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.670
discussions. You will notice that there is a YouTube

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.220
video that is embedded right within the discussion forum.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.600
There. Now let's talk about how to upload a

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.120
photo. To do that, I will click on this

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.110
tiny photo icon, and then simply upload a photo

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.950
from my computer. That's the one I want to upload.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.930
And you will notice that much like the YouTube

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.640
video, the photo is also uploaded right here within the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.870
discussion forums. Let me hit Submit, and done. So

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.860
here I am, back to the mini project, which is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.400
for you to teach the program that we have

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.610
written together, to a friend or a colleague. We also

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.310
want you to use your smartphone to record a video

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.050
of your conversation. And then share that YouTube video with

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.220
us on the discussion forum. Oh, by the way, if you are

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.030
an unable to record a video, we would love to see some

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.450
photos or some text describing your conversation with your friend. After you've

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.960
submitted your responses on the forum, make sure you check this box.
