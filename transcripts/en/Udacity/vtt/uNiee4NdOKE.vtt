00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
What I like to do with the equations written in standard form, is to first put

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:08.339
them into slope intercept form. If I had an equation like this, I would want to

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.485
change it to slope intercept form. I would want to get the y alone. So I'd have

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:16.885
3y equals 6 minus 2x. And, really, I could list the negative 2x first. In slope

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:21.352
intercept form, that's the case. The x term comes first. I can make the switch

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:25.827
here, and write my equation like this. Because of the commutative property of

00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:30.423
addition and subtraction. 1 plus 2 is the same as 2 plus 1. Likewise, positive 6

00:00:30.423 --> 00:00:34.690
minus 2x is the same thing as negative 2x plus 6. Notice that the sign stays

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.569
with the term. The 6 is positive. And the 2x is negative. Finally we divide

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:44.406
every term by 3 to get y equals negative 2 3rds x plus 2. Now we can read that

00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:49.509
the slope is negative 2 3rds. Pretty great. I can also see the slope by looking

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:54.256
at standard form. The slope is going to be equal to the value of a divided by

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:59.375
the value of b. In this case a is positive to And b is positive 3. So I

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:05.372
substitute 2 for a, and 3 for b. So, we get negative 2 thirds.
