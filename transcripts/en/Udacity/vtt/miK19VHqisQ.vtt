00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.674
Let's recap the 2 systems of the Autonomic Nervous System. The Parasympathetic

00:00:05.674 --> 00:00:11.490
and the Sympathetic. Remember Parasympathetic is when we're normally resting.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.719
This results in things such as constricted pupils. It also constricts the

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:23.940
bronchi. It also results in slowed heart rate, and finally allows us to digest.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.763
However, when something happens that is arousing, frightening or stressful. The

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:32.850
Parasympathetic Nervous System turns off, and the Sympathetic Nervous System

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.938
turns on. Here, we're going to see an opposite effect of what happens in the

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:42.960
Parasympathetic. So, for example, here we'll have dilated pupils. We'll also

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.914
see that the bronchi will relax. When the bronchi is relaxed, it allows for

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:53.116
increased air intake. So we have more oxygen for our muscles. Also we'll see

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:57.034
that we'll have an increased heart rate. Again, this allows for our fighting or

00:00:57.034 --> 00:01:01.250
our fleeing. Finally, we'll also see that the Sympathetic Nervous System will

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.412
inhibit digestion. We don't need to worry about digesting our food when we need

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:07.899
to run away from a dangerous situation.
