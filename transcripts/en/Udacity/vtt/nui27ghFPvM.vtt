00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.480
One of the most widely used security
services is the secure socket layer or

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.650
SSL and the follow on standard known
as the transport layer security or TLS.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.000
TLS can be provided as part of
the underlying protocol suite and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.840
therefore, all applications
above the transport layer

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.730
can benefit from the security
services provided by TLS.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.680
Alternatively, TLS can be imbedded
in specific application packages.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.890
For example,
most browsers come equipped with SSL and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.640
most web servers have
implemented the protocol.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
TLS is designed to make use
of TCP to provide a reliable

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290
end to end secure service.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.650
TLS is not a single protocol but

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.200
rather, two layers of protocols
as illustrated in this figure.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.840
The record protocol provides
basic security services

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.790
to various higher layer protocols.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.580
For example,
HTTP can operate on top of TLS.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.640
Three higher layer protocols
are defined as part of TLS.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.070
The Handshake Protocol,
the Change Cipher Spec Protocol, and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.630
the Alert Protocol.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.590
These TLS specific protocols are used
in the management of TLS exchanges.
