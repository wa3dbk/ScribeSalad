00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.130
Okay, so I will search for Python Standard

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.420
Library, and I got to this documentation page.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.700
By the way, the link to this page is also

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.800
available in the instructor notes. I will check to make

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.079
sure that I am reading documentation for the version of

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.130
Python I downloaded, which is version 2.7. In here, I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.598
can scroll down to web browser. You will notice that

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:27.414
it says here, that the web browser module provides a

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:30.870
high level interface to allow displaying web based documents to

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.750
users, which is really a fancy way of saying, it will

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.181
show you websites. And if I scroll down,

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.751
I can find the function, webbrowser.open, which takes in

00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:45.440
a URL and displays that URL using the default browser. If I go back, I can also

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.030
find the module named time. Here it is, and if I click on it, I can read

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.000
its documentation. It says, this module provides various time

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.100
related functions, and we use two of those functions.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.190
If you scroll down, you'll find time.ctime,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.900
which gives the current time of the computer,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.070
and time.sleep, which suspends execution for a given number of seconds.
