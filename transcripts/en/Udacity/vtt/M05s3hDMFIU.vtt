00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the answer is p--is indeed contained within np and the reason is if the problem that we had

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
can be decided by some polynomial time algorithm s that takes the input, runs in polynomial time,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and either says yes or no correctly for that input, then we can design--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
remember that the main thing in the definition of np is that it has a verification algorithm,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so we can define a verification algorithm like this--define a to take the input and any certificate

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that simply returns s of x--this runs in polynomial time and it accepts inputs and certificates correctly.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So for any input x, there's some certificate that makes it say yes--that is to say any certificate--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because if the answer is yes, it's always going to return yes.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And if the answer is no, there's no certificate you can give it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that would get it to say anything other than no.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's again because it's a growing certificate and actually just giving the answer.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So it's satisfies the two things that we need for the problem to be an np.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So anything np is also an np.
