00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.069
One of the interesting things
about learning to use Core Data is

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.024
the chance to see
an entire NBC architecture,

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:07.830
as envisioned by some
of Apple's developers.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.880
In this last Core Data lesson we want
to look at a particular issue for NBC.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.110
How should the view code be
notified when the model is updated?

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.385
Core Data encourages two techniques,
NSNotificationCenter and

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.800
NSFetchResultsController.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.522
You may recall NSNotificationCenter
from the networking course, but

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:27.420
this FetchResultsController is new and
pretty cool, we think you'll like it.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.600
We recommend that you use
the FetchResultsController

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.280
in the Virtual Tourist app.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.730
In this lesson we'll show you how
it works in a similar app, and

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.780
at the end of the lesson,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.280
we think that you'll be ready to
tackle the fourth portfolio project.
