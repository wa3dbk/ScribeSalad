00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.120
So there are actually two options here, two right answers. One way that you

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:08.455
could move towards having x by itself would be to multiply each side by negative

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:12.530
1. The coefficient here in front of x is negative 1, so if we multiply it by

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:16.855
negative 1, we get negative 1 times negative 1, which is just equal to positive

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:21.109
1, and that would leave us with x equal to 6. However, there's one other way you

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.869
could do this. You could also have said that you would divide each side by

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:28.405
negative 1. I'm just writing in here what you would type if this had been your

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:32.246
answer. The reason this works is that the coefficient here, as we said, is

00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:35.060
negative 1. So we take negative 1 and divide by negative 1. We're just dividing

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:39.007
a number by itself, and we get positive 1. So once again, that would leave us

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.633
with just x by itself. And a positive 6 on the other side. So, both methods

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:43.934
work.
