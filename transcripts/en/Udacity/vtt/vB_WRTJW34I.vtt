I'm feeling a little impatient. I don't think that I can wait, a thousand

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:07.040
years, for my money to mature to a million dollars. What if the invention of

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.725
self driving cars, changes the economy so completely, that interest rates go up

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:15.660
to 10%. How long would it take to get to 1 billion then, starting with 100?

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.492
Start with the same code that you started with last time, and modify the

00:00:18.492 --> 00:00:22.019
program, this time, so that, you change the interest rate.
