00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But why does the post condition of square root fail? The answer is simple, yet not so simple.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What we lack here is diagnostic information.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We don't know the values of r or z or anything that happens in between.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So what we do is, we set up a framework that allows us to access these.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So what we have set here is we have set up a try except block around the square root function,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which catches the assertion and when an assertion is being raised,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or any other kind of error is being raised, we print out the offending parameter r

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we exit the loop, so let's see what happens here if we invoke the whole thing.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So here's the bad value, 8*436.9207865. Wow, magic value.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So why can't we just square this. What's wrong here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So we print out the value and now we go

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and actually square the square root and multiply it by itself.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's see what we got--again, we run the whole thing and 2123.01753488

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and this is 2123.01753488.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Well, by all means and measures, these two look identical to me.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Why does the assertion above it failed.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We can solve the mystery simply by looking at the actual difference between these two values.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Let's see what the numerical difference is between

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the square root, square, and original value itself.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Here comes another value which fails 9,049. something and here at the very end,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you see the difference--it's 10^-12, meaning that 12 digits after the comma

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we do have a difference between r and the √r²

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The reason why this assertion failed is simply a rounding error,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the numbers are the same up to the 11th digit.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
At the 12th digit, they actually are different and this is why the assertion failed.
