00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.380
Prototypes come in various forms.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.180
Some are paper, some are clickable
screens, some are built using code.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.470
No matter the medium,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.680
one thing these prototypes have in
common is their intended purpose.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.840
The core purpose of a prototype is to
help you communicate the story of your

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.930
app to your stake holders for
feedback or research sessions.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.270
This stops you from wasting time
building a really polished product

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.410
that has really glaring flaws.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.600
Prototyping is not just
specific to the tech industry.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.790
Product design companies and

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.920
car manufacturers have been utilizing
prototypes from the very beginning.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.910
Prototyping is a way to help you
make the best decisions possible

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.450
around the user experience
of your product.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.630
Helps you make key decisions and help
you build better products through moving

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.640
through various stages,
which we'll talk about later.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.560
It's been said that an estimated
50% of engineering time

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.150
is spent doing rework that
could've been avoided.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.350
What's more, fixing an error after
development is up to 100 times

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.050
as expensive as it would've been before.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.750
Customers who have a positive user
experience are going to be more likely

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.409
to stick with your products and
become your brand advocates.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.310
Now let's take a look at the various
stages of prototyping that we'll cover

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.930
in this course.
