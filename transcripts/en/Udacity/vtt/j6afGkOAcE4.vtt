00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.500
So it turns out that this middle sheet of paper is going to make the box with

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.606
the biggest volume. But in order to really visualize that you have to put the

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:17.940
boxes together. So let's start out by doing that. Okay, so now we have three

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.895
boxes and I think it's time to make use of our M&amp;amp;Ms now.

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:28.605
[NOISE][SOUND]

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:46.164
Okay, so I've filled each of these boxes with M&amp;amp;Ms as best I can.

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:49.796
Unfortunately, I ran out over here, probably because I ate some of them. But I

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:53.720
think we can already tell, just by looking at the dimensions of this, little

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.600
skinny box. That its volume is definitely less than the other two boxes. It's

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.305
so flat, it can't possibly be the biggest. So now that we're left with two

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:08.910
choices. Now I could go through and count every single M&amp;amp;M in this box and

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.938
every single M&amp;amp;M in this box. But, I'm kind of lazy and that would take a

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:16.639
really long time. So, I will tell you that when I filled these M&amp;amp;Ms it took me

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:21.312
several more handfuls of M&amp;amp;Ms to fill this box than to fill this box. So that

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:26.310
means that its pretty good guess that this one has more volume. However as with

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.317
many things you see in this course I think we're going to need to do some math

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:32.603
to find a more rigorous way of analyzing the volume of any kind of box that we

00:01:32.603 --> 00:01:36.589
could make out of a piece of paper.
