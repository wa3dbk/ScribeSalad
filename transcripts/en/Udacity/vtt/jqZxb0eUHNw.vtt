00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the answer is 1,024.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If the hash is a good cryptographic hash

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and it produces a uniform distribution,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the probability that any bit is a zero is 1/2,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we need to find an applet that starts with 10 zeros.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Note that it doesn't matter how big the output of the hash function is.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is the same whether it's a 256-bit output or 192-bit output.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It doesn't matter how big the output of the hash function is,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
whether its only outputting 10 bits

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or its outputting a more reasonable number, like 256 bits,

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as long as we restrict it to the first 10 bits having to be zero.
