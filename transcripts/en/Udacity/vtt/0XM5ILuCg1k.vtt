00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.406
Let's extend these ideas to a more complicated situation. You might have

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:07.826
received a survey that I sent out, asking you to rank your engagement and

00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:13.700
learning, from 1 to 10. Thank you to everyone who took this poll. I collected

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.976
the first 235 scores, as reported by Saturday, March 16th And I put them in a

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:23.175
link at the bottom so you can click on that and analyze the data. I removed any

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:27.960
blank responses but that's it. One thing to note before beginning to analyze

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380
this data is that I didn't state a very clear operation definition of

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.540
engagement and learning. FOr example if someone has only had time to view one

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.486
lesson, but then life got in the way. Their engagement might be one. That

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:46.610
doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't enjoy what they were watching. So,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.110
there are many arbitrary reasons why someone may choose the number they did.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.728
This is a good example, where confidence intervals are not necessarily the best

00:00:54.728 --> 00:01:00.400
way to analyze this data after some kind of intervention. Because there's not a

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.760
real meaning to the scores people give, but in general, we know that higher

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.420
scores are better, and this is where hypothesis testing comes in. First let's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.162
get to know this data. Here are histograms showing students' responses. For

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:18.797
this next example, let's just focus on engagement. What are the mean and

00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:23.106
standard deviation engagement scores? Even though the responses are a sample,

00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:27.410
just treat it as a population for the sake of this example. You're welcome to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.714
also calculate the mean and standard deviation for learning if you're

00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:35.693
interested. But we really only need the parameters for engagement.
