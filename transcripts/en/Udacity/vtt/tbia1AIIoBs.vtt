00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.970
Talking about text, if you really want
to reduce the number of file requests

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.390
your page makes,
you can inline images using code.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.350
Two ways to do that, SVG and DataURIs.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.570
Now here's a vector graphic
you may have seen before.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.450
Both versions look identical, and
here they are in emulation mode.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.310
And here on a real phone.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.402
Looking at the page source, you'll see
that the logos are declared inline.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:35.365
There's an SVG and
an image element with a data URI source.

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:40.520
Inline SVG has great support on
mobile and desktop browsers, and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.230
optimization tools can
significantly reduce SVG size.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.990
Spot the difference, these two
inline SVG logos look identical, but

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.150
one is around 3 kilobytes and
the other only about 2k.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.032
SVG is incredibly powerful.

00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:02.838
Check out this interactive version of
Trajan's Column, works on mobile too.

00:01:02.838 --> 00:01:05.976
And the best thing,
all that responsive interactivity for

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:07.555
less that 160 kilobytes.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.040
For more amazing SVG examples,
check out the link below the video.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.030
Data URIs provide a way to include
a file such as an image inline as

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.970
a base64 encoded string
using the following format.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.580
The full version is
around 5,000 characters.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.020
Just like SVG, Data URIs
are well supported on mobile and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.130
desktop browsers.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.600
That's around well,
nearly 97% of browsers.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.676
So you can inline images in your HTML,
but

00:01:40.676 --> 00:01:45.110
Data URIs and
SVGs can also be inlined in CSS.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.970
Works on desktop and on mobile.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.510
Here we have two identical looking
images implemented as background images

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.370
in CSS, one data URI and one SVG.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.950
Now the code looks a bit crazy so
why would you want to do this?

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.330
Well, to reduce HTTP requests.
