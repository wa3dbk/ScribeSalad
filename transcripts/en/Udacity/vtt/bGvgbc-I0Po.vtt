00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.469
So as Lorenzo mentioned, there are two qualities to the central nervous system

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.904
that influence introversion and extroversion. And these two qualities are

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:12.697
cortical arousal levels and sensory threshold levels. For example, by cortical

00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:17.635
arousal, we mean how much the brain is active at rest. And some people, while

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:22.235
at rest, not being stimulated, their brain is really quite active. And coupled

00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:27.210
with that often, is a low sensory threshold. Meaning for these people, it

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.734
doesn't take much stimulation to arouse them. And we call these people who have

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:36.438
this pattern introverts. And introverts are often regulating their behavior in

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:41.804
order to optimize their arousal level. So they withdraw from people they don't

00:00:41.804 --> 00:00:46.547
know. They tend to avoid real sensory experiences like parachuting and roller

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:52.864
coaster rides, and jumping off cliffs into water. So on the other hand we see

00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:56.896
the opposite pattern in extroverts, and in extroverts we have low cortical

00:00:56.896 --> 00:01:03.670
arousal and high sensory threshold. Meaning that at rest the brain activity of

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.980
extroverts is relatively low in activity. And coupled with that is a high

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.828
sensory threshold, meaning it takes more stimulation to arouse extroverts. So

00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:21.500
they regulate their behavior and arousal levels by seeking out stimulation.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.372
They really want to be around people, around noisy environments. Do thrill

00:01:26.372 --> 00:01:30.207
seeking and risky kinds of things like parachuting and roller coaster riding

00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:34.984
and jumping off cliffs. So you may or may not have noticed that, in fact, we

00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:38.020
filmed these two different scenes, talking about introversion and extroversion

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.227
in different environments. So when we were talking about in introverts, we were

00:01:43.227 --> 00:01:47.640
in a white background room. And now we're in a room with more colors and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.054
there's more going on. This was not a coincidence because as it turns out

00:01:52.054 --> 00:01:55.564
introverts tend to feel more comfortable in, in rooms and environments where

00:01:55.564 --> 00:02:00.475
there's less going on. And extroverts tend to feel more comfortable in rooms

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:03.460
and environments where there's more going on.
