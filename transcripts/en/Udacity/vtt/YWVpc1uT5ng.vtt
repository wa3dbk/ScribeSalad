00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.230
Once again, I've drawn the vertical, and the horizontal asymptotes, for this

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.836
rational function, on our coordinate plane. And we can see, that this time, the

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:13.166
graph is divided into six different sections, by these asymptotes. In which

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.774
sections of the plane does the graph reside? Think about where its x and

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:20.990
y-intercepts are, and also, try plugging in points, from these different areas,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.822
and see which ones work for this equation.
