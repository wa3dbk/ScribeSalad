00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.096
So, I'll pick up where I left off. I wrote those tests to protect the

00:00:03.096 --> 00:00:06.889
functionality of the person class. So, I can run them again to find out which

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:11.298
method's broke when I changed the friends variable. Looks like the first thing

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:16.309
that's broken is that I'm trying to add a string into my array list of person.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.760
So, I no longer need to get the name out of the friend before adding it. If I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.598
run the test, it looks like the getFriends method is still broken. But the

00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:28.898
getFriends method that takes a separator is good. The get number of friends

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:32.790
method seems to be working alright still. So I'll need to look at this original

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.452
getFriends method. When we run the two string method on the friends array list,

00:00:36.452 --> 00:00:41.430
it doesn't have a good way of printing a simple representation for each friend.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.782
I can think of two convenient solutions to this problem. One possibility is to

00:00:44.782 --> 00:00:50.520
delete this, and just use the other getFriends method, that we already fixed.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.344
I'll just call getFriends, and pass in a comma and a space as a separator. And

00:00:56.344 --> 00:01:00.530
now if I run the test, the getFriends method prints what I would hope.
