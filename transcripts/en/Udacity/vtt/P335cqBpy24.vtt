00:00:00.672 --> 00:00:03.167
Responsive design, I know.

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:07.728
It's fun to resize your web browser 
and see which sites resize gracefully,

00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:12.480
and which sites remain defiantly large 
with gross horizontal scroll bars.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.568
But responsive design 
is not just for the web.

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:19.395
Today, the lines between phones 
and tablet's are disappearing.

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.158
So it's important to think about how 
your UI will scale

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:24.181
in our multiscreen world.

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.685
Don't be overwhelmed. 
Just like designing responsive layouts

00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:31.280
for the web, build your layouts 
to be reasonably flexible

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.851
or within a common device size.

00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:37.516
Then you can set break points, 
providing alternative layouts

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:40.414
for those various sizes. 
Think about it this way,

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:47.704
small phone, large phone, 
medium tablet, and large tablet.
