00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
And What we'll find is

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.292
that party A got 7/12 of the vote,

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:07.117
which is the majority, whereas the other ones

00:00:07.117 --> 00:00:11.285
only received 2/12, 1/12, and 2/12.

00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:15.135
So if we go forward 7 pieces in this diagram

00:00:15.135 --> 00:00:20.265
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- we check mark this box.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.991
Another 2 gives us this box.

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:25.315
Another 1 gives us this box.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:27.200
and these are the final two.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.771
So here’s how this chart will look like,

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:33.219
Obviously A takes the majority outcome,

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.585
B reaps this slice over here,

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.748
C is the smallest party,

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.447
and D is the one over here.
