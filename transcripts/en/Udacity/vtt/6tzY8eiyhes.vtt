00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.744
When we first look at the composition of two function, we first evaluated a

00:00:03.744 --> 00:00:08.774
function, add a number. And then we took that output and plugged it back into a

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:14.080
new function to get a new output. But we wouldn't want to do this every single

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.050
time for every single different number. Wouldn't it be nice if we just had one

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.092
function that could do the composition for us? This is what we're going to find

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:29.550
right now. F of g in terms of x. To find f of g of x, we're simply going to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.766
take the entire function, g of x and plug it in for the variable x. We'll plug

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:43.752
this function into the other function as an input. So anywhere that we see x in

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:49.475
our function for f, we're going to replace it with x plus 5. So notice that I

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:56.540
have 3x here. So instead of 3x, I'll have 3 times, x plus 5, my new input.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.155
Notice how I took the entire function of g of x. And I put it inside as the

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:07.396
input for f of x. Distributing this positive 3 will get the function 3x plus

00:01:07.396 --> 00:01:12.400
15. This is the composite function f of g of x.
