00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.742
So we have seen in the latest quiz, that the

00:00:02.742 --> 00:00:06.342
one bit predictor works reasonably well for rules that have

00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:09.214
a lot of iterations. So what are the problems with

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:13.227
one bit prediction that have related to better predictors. The

00:00:13.227 --> 00:00:16.590
one bit predictor predicts well,branches that are always taken it

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.068
might make a mistake that first time it's used the

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:22.136
branch, but after that it's going to start predicting taken

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:25.360
and because of branches always take it always works well.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.285
Similarly always not taken is predict as well because

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:31.340
the very first time it might mispredict, but after that

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.810
it learns the behavior and it stays the same so

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.290
we just have the always not taken. It also predicts

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.410
well,the branches where the number of taken outcomes is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.702
vastly more than the number of not taken outcomes. Here

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:46.898
it's going to learn after the first taken outcome that the

00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:50.570
next outcome should be predicted taken, and very, very rarely

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.950
it's going to be wrong because of a not taken

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.178
outcome. Similarly, the one way predictor predicts well when the

00:00:57.178 --> 00:01:00.016
number of not taken outcomes is vastly more than the

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:04.250
number of taken outcomes for the same reason. Basically we

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.700
will see not taken, not taken, not taken many, many

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.780
times. The first time we see one of those we're

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.960
going to learn it. And then the taken outcome will be

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.550
mispredicted. So what's wrong with the one, one bit predictor.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.770
What's wrong with it, can be glimpsed from these.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.800
Let's look at the branch that is for example,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.760
more taken than not. So it's been taken many

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.580
times. And then there is a not taken outcome and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.240
then it's going to be taken many more times.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.470
Let's now look at whether the one we predicted would

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.130
be right on these. It's been taken many times,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.600
so it's going to predict taken, and then because it's

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.500
been taken it's going to predict the next one as

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.190
taken. The next one is going to be predicted taken,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.400
taken again. When we reach the not taken outcome, the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.840
last outcome was taken, so we will have a misprediction.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.210
This would not be much of a problem if not

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.700
taken occurs very rarely, because we are basically mispredicting just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.440
the very rare occurrences. However, there is an interesting problem

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.910
here, which is now that we are back to our

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.610
taken behavior, which is the vastly dominant behavior

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.450
in this case,. The last outcome was not not

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.290
taken. So we're going to mispredict this branch too.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.830
Now, we're predicting not taken and the branch will

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.650
be taken. After this, the previous outcome was taken

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.770
so we predict taken. And we continue predicting taken.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.730
So the problem really is. That each anomaly, such

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.970
as we have a branch that is almost always

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.920
taken but sometimes it's not taken, results in two

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.532
mispredictions. One for the anomalous behavior and then once

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:40.648
more for the normal behavior that follows the anomaly.

00:02:40.648 --> 00:02:43.035
So the one bit predictor will not do so

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:46.654
well, when the branch is biased towards, let's say,

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:49.657
doing more taken branches but the number of not

00:02:49.657 --> 00:02:53.199
taken branches is still significant, or when there is

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.230
more not taken branches. But the number of taken

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.070
branches is significant. Because for each of the less

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.730
dominant behavior is going to do mispredictions not just

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.674
one. Typically also a branch predictor like this will

00:03:06.674 --> 00:03:09.550
not do well on short loops. Why? Because in a

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.520
short loop we have a branch,that for example, exits

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.460
the loop. Then we have some loop behavior and then

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.580
a branch that loops back. The branch that exits

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.260
the loop. Will be predicted correctly as long as we

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.290
stay in the loop by this predictor. The exit from

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.320
the loop will be mispredicted. The branch vector will now

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.950
be trained to take this path here. When we come

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.400
back to this short loop. It's going to mispredict the very

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.290
first iteration for this branch. Because now it's going to think

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.560
it should be this way. But, in fact, now we're

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.132
staying in the loop. So have, for example, an eight

00:03:43.132 --> 00:03:47.640
iteration loop. We will have two mispredictions every 80 duration's.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.620
One at the end of the loop and one

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.930
at the beginning of the loop because the previous

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.640
ending of the loop trained the predictor that way.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.840
And then of course the one with predictor will be

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.030
pretty bad. When the number of taken and not taken outcomes is similar, yet

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.900
predictable. We will talk about this more later. But now, let's

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.070
first devise a predictor that will fix this. So, can we devise

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.252
a predictor that behaves similarly well here, but

00:04:16.252 --> 00:04:19.880
does not mispredict twice whenever there is an anomaly.
