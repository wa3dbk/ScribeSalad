00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.437
This one. The means are significantly different, because you can see that their

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:10.269
variability within each sample is less. The more variability each sample has

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.970
with itself, the less significant the sample mean differences are. The same

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.308
goes if we have three or more samples. Remember how we used a sample mean to

00:00:19.308 --> 00:00:23.276
construct a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean that the

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:28.968
sample came from? In this case, the true population mean would most likely be

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:33.838
somewhere in here in this interval. And the the true population mean from the

00:00:33.838 --> 00:00:39.315
red sample would probably be somewhere in here. It's very, very unlikely that

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:45.053
the true population means will be the same. But in this case, when there's more

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:49.609
variability within the samples, the population mean could be anywhere from here

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:56.626
to here for this blue sample, or here to here for the red sample. Thus, there's

00:00:56.626 --> 00:01:00.847
this overlap here, and it's likely that the populations that these samples came

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:03.420
from have the same mean.
