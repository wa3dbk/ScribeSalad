00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.858
So for this I'm going to want you guys to fill in the chart that I'm about to

00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:06.900
make. Now first, we know that our Nervous System is divided into two main

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.487
areas. One, that deals with our outside body. An the other that's responsible

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:17.250
for our brain an spinal cord. Then we further divide this system into two more.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.533
One that deals with sensory information and one that deals with our involuntary

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.802
systems. We divide the involuntary system into the Sympathetic and the

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:29.638
Parasympathetic. One of these systems brings us back to normal and the other

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:35.150
system is responsible for the flight or fight response. Here are your options,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.840
the Somatic Nervous System, back to normal, Central Nervous System, Autonomic

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.872
Nervous System, fight or flight, Peripheral Nervous System. Type in the answers

00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:46.939
in these blanks.
