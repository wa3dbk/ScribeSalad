00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.160
Engaging with your customer,
isn't always as easy, as it may seem.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.240
Some companies have gotten themselves
into some pretty sticky situations,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.110
because of the lack of thought, they put
into responding to customer feedback.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.140
One example, is when Lululemon,
a popular yoga clothes company,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.580
blamed their customers for
the flaw in their yoga pants.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.800
Their response was not consistent
with the tone or the voice,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.070
the company typically
displays to their customers.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.720
When your responding, their goal should
be to attempt to make things right for

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.210
your customer, or sincerely
offer what ever support you can.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.170
You're going to want to keep track of
complaints, suggestions or feedback and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.790
use this opinions as options
to improve your product.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.190
Now, when you want to respond
to customers keep in mind

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.610
the following things.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.860
Don't wait too long to respond, but make
sure you're not being overly reactive.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.960
When you can,
try to avoid templated responses.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.570
Well, it may be easier for
your team, to just send them out.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.200
You want to show each customer
that you appreciate the feedback,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.400
because after all they're only trying
to help you improve your product.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.740
And because of this, you should
thank the user for their feedback.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.580
If there's a problem,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.810
take ownership over that problem,
it is your product, after all.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.155
If it's something the customer
could do to improve the problem,

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:15.680
try something like, hey,
your feedback was helpful, or

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.940
sorry you're having trouble with,
[INAUDIBLE] Viewing the settings.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.620
We may not have been clear enough as to
where you can find it, so try clicking

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.020
in the lower left hand corner to see
your settings, if it doesn't work,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.240
go ahead and reach out to support@ .com
and we'll try to fix it right away.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.570
And finally, like I said before,
monitor the situation.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.280
Make sure you're tracking
all of the feedback and

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.270
you want to make sure whatever
problem customers are having,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.570
end up being solved.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.010
Make sure you're listening
to the feedback and

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.310
getting the full story
of what's going on.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.650
If somebody gives you feedback like,
I like that you offer vet service for

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.420
my dog but it could be better,
this is really vague and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.660
it doesn't really help you build off of.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.130
So we,
at Should attempt to reach out and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.190
get a better understanding of how we
can improve their customer experience,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.820
which could help us in the long run and
make more customers happy.
