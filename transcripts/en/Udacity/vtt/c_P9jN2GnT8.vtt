00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.130
We can use this same approach to simplify radicals that contain variables.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.611
We'll want to simplify these numbers first and pull anything out, or any

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:11.848
factors out that we can. Remember since we have square roots here, we can only

00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:16.100
pull out factors that appear twice. Once we have like radicals, we can add them

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.953
together. So what do you think for this one, what would be the answer?
