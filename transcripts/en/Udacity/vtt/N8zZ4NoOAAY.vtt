00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.877
Here I have angle A and angle B. We call the angles by their vertex. The point

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:09.917
right here at the corner of each angle is the vertex. But we're not so concerned

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.364
with that. We're going to look at the angle measures. Angle A is going to

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:19.287
measure 30 degrees and angle B is going to measure 60 degrees. A and B are said

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:24.259
to be complementary angles. Why do you think that is? What do you think this

00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:29.018
work complementary means? Let's see if you can figure it out. So if C and D are

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.813
complementary angles, and E and F are complementary angles, what do you think D

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:38.633
and F measure? Type your answer in here and don't worry about the degree symbol,

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.372
I've already put it for you.
