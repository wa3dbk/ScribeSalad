00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.100
So let's see if we understood how
test and atomic-op logs work.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.820
Remember our original code for
load links for

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.140
conditional locks which loads
the previous state of the lock,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.910
tries to put one into the lock and
then checks whether we

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.380
observe the unlock state of the lock and
whether we successfully grab the lock.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.180
So if we apply the test
an automatic approach to this.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.430
Amazingly we do that by just
rearranging these instructions.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.950
The first two instructions
are exactly the same.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.000
And then in what order do we use
the remaining three instructions?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.430
Instead of writing out the instruction,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.980
just say which of these is
instruction A, B, and C.
