00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.080
Armed with an abstract model of
a message-passing algorithm, what about

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.630
a programming model that implements it
so that we can write an actual program.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.660
That's the topic of this lesson.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.100
It's a particular library standard
called the message passing interface,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.230
or MPI for short.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.430
Now I've picked out a couple
of things for you to read so

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.290
that you can get familiar
with how MPI works.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.580
The main things I want you
to keep an eye out for

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.150
are how to do hello world in MPI.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.250
How to do asynchronous sends and
receives using the routines MPI I send,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.600
I receive, wait, and wait all.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.620
How to use the built in collective
operations like barriers, reductions,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.320
scatters, gathers, all to alls.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.015
And finally,
what the heck is a communicator?

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:47.580
MPI_COMM_WORLD, what is that?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.120
Now, sometime after you're done,
I'm sure there will be

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.440
an assignment of some sort to give
you hands on experience with MPI.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.210
So pay attention!
