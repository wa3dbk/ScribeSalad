00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.080
The acronyms API get's thrown around
a lot in the computer science community,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.300
but what is an API and
why is it so important?

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.060
Well, APIs
are Application Programming Interfaces

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.220
refer to any method of communication
between two entities of code.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.010
You can think of APIs as
connection points in code

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.810
that allow one application
to talk to another.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.780
When you copy code from a browser and

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.240
paste it into a word
processing application,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.480
an API inside your computer helped
make that transfer of data happen.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.970
If you listen to music on your computer,
like with Itunes or

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.640
Spotify, the music-playing application
communicated with your operating

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.435
system's API in order to send
that music to your speakers.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.480
APIs are a great way for
controlling the exposure of code,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.140
allowing internal functionalities
of an application to be used

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.888
from the outside world without
exposing all of the internal code.

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:51.230
Companies that want to keep
their code bases private,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.500
like the makers of Microsoft Windows or
Mac OS X,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.070
use APIs to make it possible for their
applications to still have interactions

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.340
with other applications without
having to reveal the actual code.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.070
Even for open source code projects, like
the Ubuntu operating system, APIs make

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.300
easy entry points to code that other
developers will most frequently use.
