[Evans] So here's the idea of how to do this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're going to start by selecting some secret,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and then we're going to compute the hash of that secret,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and then we're going to do that again.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We're going to compute the hash that we got for the first time as the input,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we're going to keep computing hashes here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This could be done anywhere. I've written it on the server side.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The important point at the end of this--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so what Alice gets is the hash of s, the hash of the hash of s,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the hash of the hash of the hash of s and so forth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Of course, if she just has s, she could compute all of these herself.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The server only stores 1 thing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The only thing the server stores is the last value in this hash chain.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So let's suppose we did this 100 times.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is the value the server would store, and that's the only value stored by the server.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So now the protocol to log in will be Alice will send the 99th value in this hash chain.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So what the server will do is compute the hash of p,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
check if it's equal to the stored value x.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If it is, it will allow Alice to log in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and will also update the value of x.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The new value of x will be the value Alice sent as p.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So that's how the first login works.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now the question is, the next time Alice logs in, what does she need to send?

00:01:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Here's the choices. Different number of times of doing the hash starting from the secret s.
