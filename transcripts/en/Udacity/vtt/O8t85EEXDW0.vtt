00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.340
So in the versions basis technique of learning concepts incrementally, we always

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.980
have a specific model and a general model. As a new example comes along,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.740
we ask ourselves is this a positive example of the concept that we learned, or

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.950
a negative example of the concept that we learned? If it's a positive example,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.480
then we generalize the specific model. If it's a negative example,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.420
we specialize the general model. Here is another set of visualizations to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.540
understand the specific and general models. This is a specific model.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.730
This is a general model. The most specific model, matches exactly one thing.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.200
The four legged, furry, black animal called Buddy. The most general

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.820
model matches everything, all animals. Here is a current specific model, and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.010
as more positive examples come, you're going to generalize this specific model.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.730
Here are some of the generalizations. Similarly,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.330
here is the current general model, and as negative examples come, we're going to

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.390
specialize the general model, and here are some of the specializations.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.280
As we'll illustrate in a minute, I'll start with the most general model and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.520
try to specialize it. Some of these generalizations and specializations that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.470
we are creating will no longer match the current data. When that happens,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.520
we'll prune them out. As we prune on this side as well on this side, the two

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.620
pathways may merge depending on the ordering of the example. When they do merge,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.010
we have a solution. The right generalization of the concept for the given

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.850
examples. So far we have been talking about this in very abstract terms.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.930
Let's make this concrete with an illustration.
