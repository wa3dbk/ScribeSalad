Remember I said earlier that if we have the equation of the probability density

00:00:05.358 --> 00:00:10.461
function we can use calculus to find the area under the curve between any two

00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:16.064
values or between negative infinity in any value. Mathematicians have put these

00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:21.283
values in a table. Here is the top of this table, it gives you a little diagram

00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:26.180
saying that when we have the z score, the values in this table tell us the

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.637
proportion less than that z score, in the standard normal curve. So this table

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:36.837
is for the standard normal distribution, and remember that's when the mean is

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:42.292
zero and the standard deviation is one. This way, after standardizing any normal

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:47.471
distribution. In other words after calculating the z scores for the values that

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:52.476
we're interested in, we can use this table to approximate the proportion less

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:58.524
than that particular z square. Here, the tenths place runs vertically and the

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:05.092
hundredths place runs horizontally. So if we have of a z score of say, negative

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:13.059
2.75. Remember, that would then be less than the mean. Negative 2.7 is here, and

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:23.137
0.05 is here. So if we follow over, these cells meet at .003. So the proportion

00:01:23.137 --> 00:01:31.348
less than negative 2.75 is .003. Or .3%. So again that's the probability that we

00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:37.922
get less than negative 2.75. And that's the proportion of objects in the sample

00:01:37.922 --> 00:01:44.381
that have a score less than negative 2.75. There's a link to the z table that we

00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:50.643
shared and so use that link when you use the z table which you are going to use

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.110
in the next quiz.
