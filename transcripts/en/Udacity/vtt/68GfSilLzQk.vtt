00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.859
The other way that, that we can do
certain types of understanding what's

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.860
going on in the brain is with what's
called physiological measurements.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.540
And so again using animals, typically,
what you'll have is you'll have a screen

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.490
where certain display,
certain things are being displayed.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.010
An animal whose head is restrained so
it's looking at a particular direction.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.630
And there's actually an electrode
recording from the neurons in the brain.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.902
You hook that up to an amplifier.

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:27.680
In the old days, you'd look at it
on oscilloscope, and actually,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.790
you'd just connect it to a speaker and
you'd listen.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.180
And more clicks meant you
were getting more response,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.760
and you have to write it down,
and report it.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.160
Then you'd have an oscilloscope
with traces, now of course,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.730
it's all computerized, all right?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.520
You've seen this picture before, this
is a picture of what it looks like for

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090
a microelectrode to be
recording from a neuron.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.650
And up on top, this is what the actual
voltages look like, these spikes.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.690
And so then down here,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.880
you have something that just sort of
counts the, the spikes that go across.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.698
So one of the first areas that people
want to look is what was called V1.

00:00:59.698 --> 00:01:02.517
Back in to old days, it was actually
called area 17, I think, but

00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:04.458
that sounded too much like UFOs or
something.

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:07.160
I don't know.
It's V1, the first visual area.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.270
And when you record from
the first visual area, and

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.960
here's an example, the way you get
a monkey to look at a particular place

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.542
is you give him juice whenever he
pushes a button when something happens.

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:23.030
And he, so he'll attend very carefully
there, and it, and it happens,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.840
he pushes the right button,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.120
he gets juice, and apparently,
monkeys really like apple juice.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.920
But while you're doing that, you're
doing other things to the visual field.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.320
And one of the things they've
found is that there are cells

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.780
that if you put up a bar,
if you put the bar,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.460
let's say horizontally,
you get hardly any reaction at all.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.010
In fact, put it up at a 45 degree,
still hardly re, any reaction.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.270
Put it up vertically in this case,
and you get a tremendous amount.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.860
And by the way, again,
this is the part where it's off.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.830
This is the part where it's on.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.640
This is the part where it's off.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.900
Now, for this particular trace, I don't
know if the bar was moving at all,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.430
or just being flashed up there.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.330
The movement I'll,
I'll show you in just a minute.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.258
But the idea is that within V1,
the first visual area of cortex, there

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:16.420
are cells that are extremely sensitive
to the orientation of essentially edges.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.880
Remember, we did
oriented edge detection?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.600
So this feels an awful lot
like oriented edge detection.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.740
It would be an oversimplification
to say that's what it's doing, but

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.770
it's related.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.720
If you recall,
we also talked about motion.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.570
Well, it turns out in V1, you also get
directional selectivity, all right?

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.680
So here, we have a cell, and these,
of course, are the spike trains.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.230
And this particular cell, if you have
a bar that's almost, that's tilted just

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.000
a little bit and moving upwards,
you get a small amount of motion.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.920
If you have a bar that's here
on this 45 degree angle and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.910
you moved it upwards,
you got a lot of spikes.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.430
What's remarkable is when you move it
down, you got no spikes at all, or

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.570
even less than resting state spikes.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.640
So not only do we have
orientation selectivity,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.890
we have movement selectivity.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.530
And you can actually make a pretty
cool plot of how this distributes

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.760
in the brain.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.830
And so this is, this is essentially,
I guess this is your brain on drugs

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.570
because, I don't know,
anyway, it's all colored.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.070
But the idea is that each
of these colors represents

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.050
these different orientations.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.740
And you can get these mappings, and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.340
you can see that it's not randomly
scattered individual points.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.815
There are regions, all right?

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:31.552
And in fact,

00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:35.639
these were referred to as hyper columns
in the sense of that little tissue

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.875
areas within the brain will all be
associated with a particular movement.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.730
Now remember, it was retina topic.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.710
So this area is all up on
one part of the retina.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.960
Sure, but within that area, there'll
be little sub parts that are for

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.990
verticals and oriented edges like that,
including different kinds of motion.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.830
So those were the kinds of things that
people saw in these first visual areas.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.140
There was a group of neuro-physiologists
Hubel and Wiesel at Harvard,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.020
who I think they worked in,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.230
in cats originally, where they first
looked at these some of these cells.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.740
They also look at a thing called XY
cells having a steady state in motion,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.430
and they won the Nobel Prize for
this work, okay?

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.680
So this idea of trying to understand
how the visual cortex was

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.950
processing the visual
signal was really in fact,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.520
that Nobel Prize was announced during,
when I was in grad school.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.450
So it was in the 80s at some point.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.310
So that gives you an idea of sort of
the recency of some of this work.
