00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.652
So, what do you think the domain of f of g of x is? Well, you may be tempted to

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:08.373
say all the real numbers since we found earlier that f composed of g equals

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:13.185
negative x squared. But I'll tell you right now that all real numbers is not

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:17.101
the Cartesian answer. Think about how we created f of g of x and you may come

00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:21.272
up with the answer. I'll give you a hint that you should probably consider the

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:24.310
domain of the input and think about how that's going to affect the domain of

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.035
our composite function. This is definitely a challenge problem so if you don't

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:30.529
get it, no big deal.
