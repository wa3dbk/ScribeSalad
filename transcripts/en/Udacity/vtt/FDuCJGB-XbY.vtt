00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.540
To answer a question,
both are okay options.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.520
This option is called software TLB
mishandling and it has the advantage of

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.410
letting the operating system use
any sort of page-table that it

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.970
wants because the hardware doesn't
really need to access the page-table.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.000
The hardware simply has the TLB.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.300
And the job of the operating
system is to put the correct

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
translations into the TLB.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.510
But you can use any organization for
the page table it wants.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.440
So the operating system,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.840
for example, may not even have
the page table in form of a table.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.450
It can use a binary tree, or
a hash table, or anything else it wants.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.800
The second option, where the processor
automatically reads page tables and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.500
updates the TLB is called
hardware TLB miss handling.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.120
In this case, the page tables need to be

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.050
in a form that is easily
accessible by the hardware.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.563
So we will have a flat or

00:00:53.563 --> 00:00:59.370
a multi-level page table like we have
seen already in our previous videos.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.770
This approach does require more
hardware, because the hardware now needs

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.900
to actually be able to access the page
tables and sequence the accesses to

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.300
the multiple levels and so on, but
it is faster than software handling.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.637
This is treated kind of
like a cache miss almost,

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:16.723
whereas here we need to execute
a little program to fill the TLB.

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:21.834
So because this is faster and
because hardware is cheap these days,

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:26.230
most high performance processors
like x86 will use this

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.940
approach of hardware TLB mishandling.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.510
But some embedded processors will
use the software TLB mishandling

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.790
because they're concerned
about the hardware cost.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.420
So they want to be as
simple as possible.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.410
And also because in this
embedded processors,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.500
TLB misses occur frequently because they
are running more regular applications.
