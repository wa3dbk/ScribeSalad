The best way to learn about classical conditioning is by starting with its

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.228
discovery by Ivan Pavlov, who was looking at digestion in dogs. Actually Pavlov

00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:13.584
learned about classical conditioning by accident. Here's what happened. Pavlov

00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:17.094
was actually a physiologist who was interested in studying digestion, and he

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:21.857
used dogs to do so. Every day he would come into his laboratory, put a little

00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:24.866
bit of meat powder on the dog's tongue, and the dog would automatically

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:30.148
salivate, and Pavlov collected that salivation and analyzed it. However, one

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:34.306
day when Pavlov came into the lab, he saw that the dog salivated automatically,

00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:39.835
even though it didn't have any meat powder. Pavlov wondered if perhaps he could

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:44.310
be the reason the dog was salivating, and it turns out he was correct.
