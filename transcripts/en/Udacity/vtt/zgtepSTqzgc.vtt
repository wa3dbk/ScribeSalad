00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.210
So here's our update rules what they end up being.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.220
The gradient descent rule we just derived says what we

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.300
want to do is more the weights in the negative

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.000
direction of the gradient. So if we negate that expression

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.410
that we had before and take a little step in

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.210
that direction we get exactly this expression. Multiply the. The

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.610
input on that weight times the target minus the activation.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.810
Whereas in the perceptron case what we were doing is taking

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.220
that same activation, thresholding it. Like,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.050
determining whether it's positive or negative.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.400
Putting in a zero or a one. And putting that in here, that's

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.390
what y hat is. So really it's the same thing except in one

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.670
case we have done the thresholding and in the other case we have

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.240
not done the thresholding. But we end up with two different algorithms

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.410
with two different behaviors. The perceptron

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.290
has this nice guarantee. A finite convergence,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.810
which is a really good thing, but that's only in the case where

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.640
we have linear separability. Whereas the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.880
gradient descent rule is good because, calculus.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.551
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:56.780
&gt;&gt; I guess that's not really an answer is it. It's, the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.220
gradient descent rule is good because it's more. Robust. To to data sets

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.120
that are not linearly separable, but it's only going to converge in the limit.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.240
To a local optimum. Alright is that, is that the story there Charles?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.080
&gt;&gt; As far as I'm concerned.
