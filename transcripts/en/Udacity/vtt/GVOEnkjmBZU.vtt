00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.330
Now let me show you how we use
these very same algorithms

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.160
in a real application.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.530
This is a cloud-based
application called QuantDesk.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.900
It was developed by a company I
cofounded called Lucena Research.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.090
Now, the way it works is
over on the left here,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.840
there are various lists of
stocks that you can choose from.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.890
I've chosen Dow Jones, and
when you click on that,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.068
you can see the list of stocks
that make up that group of stocks.

00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:31.110
There are any number of ways that you
can list particular stocks you're

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.900
interested in looking at.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.410
Now, over here are our
forecasting options, and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.160
this is how we tell the machine
learning algorithm which

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.750
factors we want to use, how far in the
future do we want to predict, and so on.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.060
We're using right now the default model,
and what that is is that's the list of

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.080
factors that we think are important for
making a future price prediction.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.310
So we can click here and
see what those factors are.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.620
This is the list of factors
that we're using now.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.900
So it turns out that these
factors are determined

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.220
using another machine
learning algorithm.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
We use a genetic algorithm for
discovering these.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.610
That's a subject for
a different lecture.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.310
But anyhow, these are the list of
factors considered at present.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.620
Now, let's do a one week forecast.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.580
Let's make it a one month forecast.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270
And let's use three months of data.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.800
So we're going to be looking back
three months at all these factors.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.810
When we roll back time, we're able to
see the future price of these stocks.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.930
So we can see how those factors
presumably affected the future price.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.900
So let's do a forecast and
see what the result looks like.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.740
So, this area here is the forecast for
Apple.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.310
This is the historical price,
looking back the last three months, and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.140
this is the forecast future price.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.330
So that line is indicating that
we think it's going to go up,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.860
and this arc line above and
below Is our confidence interval.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.949
We also report that data in
a tabular format up here.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:14.180
So this is the current price, this
is the forecast change in price, and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.150
the forecast percentage change.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.249
So, our system thinks that from today
Apple is going to go up about 2.5%.

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.000
Now, we also report some
other information over here.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.490
We report what we call confidence and
back tests score.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.640
Confidence refers to when we
find those k nearest neighbors,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.810
how diverse are the ys that comes back?

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.710
So, k is the number of neighbors, and
when we look at all those neighbors,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.540
are the closest to the values of the
quantities that Apple has today, we find

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.880
the 30 closest ones, and we look at the
standard deviation among all those 30.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.620
If they're very close,
we're confident in our prediction.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.360
If they're spread apart,
we're less confident.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.210
So you can see here, American Express
is a more confident prediction, and,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.820
we rate this by a number of stars, by
the way, where five stars represent our

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.710
most confident estimates and one star,
of course, our least confident.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.606
So our system thinks that
American Express is going to go down by

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.530
0.9% over the next month.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.800
It's got a high confidence, and
it's also got a high back test score.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.650
So what's this back test score?

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.660
What we do is we roll back time, and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.440
we look over all this last three
months and look forward one month.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.160
And we see how accurate
all those predictions were

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.920
over the last three months.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.030
The more accurate those were,
the higher ranking we get there.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.500
So this is just an example of
how we can use these same tools

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.820
to make predictions in
a live real system.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.960
And this is using, behind the scenes,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.800
the same software that you're
learning in this class.
