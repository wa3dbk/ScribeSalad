00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
So once again we need a new kind of number classification, one that goes beyond

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.524
just imaginary numbers and just real numbers. You can see I've drawn a new giant

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:14.276
rectangle around both of those families of numbers and labeled it with the name

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:18.825
complex numbers. So examining our new diagram, can you tell me which of the

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:24.117
following statements are true? All real numbers are complex. All complex numbers

00:00:24.117 --> 00:00:29.236
are real. All imaginary numbers are complex. All complex numbers are imaginary.

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:34.323
All real numbers are imaginary, or all imaginary numbers are real. Please check

00:00:34.323 --> 00:00:39.062
off as many of these as you think are true. Be careful in remembering how our

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:43.984
diagram works. In particular, how do you tell if one set of numbers is a subset

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:45.000
of another set?
