00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.590
The distribution of public keys is often
done through a certificate authority

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.780
or CA.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.340
Alice sends a public key to the CA.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.900
The CA verifies Alice's identification,
and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.640
then creates a certificate of Alice's
public key and sends it to Alice.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.780
The certificate contains time of
creation, validity period, and

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.100
the ID of Alice, and the public key.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.870
And, it is signed using
a CA's public key.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.480
Alice can then send this
certificate to any user, say Bob.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.950
Or, Alice can publish it so
that any user can get it.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.640
It is assumed that all users
have the CAs public key, and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.080
therefore a user, say Bob,
can use the CAs public key

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.230
to verify the certificate and
obtain Alice's public key.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.020
Likewise, Bob can get his
certificate and send it to Alice so

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.540
that Alice has Bob's public key.
