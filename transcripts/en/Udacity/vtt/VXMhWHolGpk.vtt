00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.510
There's always more changes
that we wish we could do,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.663
if we just had a little more time.

00:00:05.663 --> 00:00:07.798
We're going to leave those
as exercises to you

00:00:07.798 --> 00:00:09.416
if you want to keep polishing it up.

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:12.558
For example, for simplicity,
we had all tablet sizes

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:15.002
and orientations, 
use the same layout.

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:19.320
However, 7 inch portrait would
actually look better as a one pin UI.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.030
So you can modify your resource folders

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.920
to make 7 inch portrait 
use the phone layout.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.130
You can also tweak the two pane behavior
so that the today layout is auto selected

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.020
when you first launch the app.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.000
Also, this should just say "today"
instead of having the full date.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.600
That way, it'll look more
like the other items.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.245
As you play around with the app, 
feel free to make any changes

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:41.000
you think would help improve
the user experience.
