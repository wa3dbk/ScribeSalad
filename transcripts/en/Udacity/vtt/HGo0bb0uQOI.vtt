00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.105
Let's start by finding the degree of each term in either polynomial. So I'll go

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:07.893
ahead and do that right now. Once we figure out the degree of each term in

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.809
either expression, we rearrange those terms that the term with the highest

00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:15.661
degree comes first and then the rest of the terms go in order of decreasing

00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:21.001
degree. So for this top polynomial, we'll need the terms to go in order of

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:26.257
degree from 3 to 2 to 1 to 0. So that's going to give us 32x cubed minus 16x

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.823
squared minus 7x plus 12. We can do the same thing for the second polynomial.

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:37.471
Written in standard form, this polynomial is negative 12x to the 7th plus 3x

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:41.968
squared plus 64x. X. Now that we have them written in this way, we can see right

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.567
off the bat that this top polynomial is a third degree polynomial and this

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.347
bottom one is a seventh degree one. So, standard form definitely makes our job

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.663
easier. Remember that standard form is something that applies to all

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:56.418
polynomials, not just ones with single variables or ones with just x's. You'll

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.400
get more practice with other polynomials in standard form later.
