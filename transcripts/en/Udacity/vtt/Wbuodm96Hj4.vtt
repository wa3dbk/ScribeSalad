00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:04.280
Final note on sort. All the algorithms we discussed were what we call key sorts,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.444
where we only sort a set of keys. Many interesting applications, however,

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:12.216
require that you sort not just a key, but a value associated with that key.

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:17.555
For instance, in unit two Dave described sorting a set of NBA players by height.

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:22.297
In this case, the key might be the height, and the value would be the player's name,

00:00:22.297 --> 00:00:25.926
the player's team, the player's history and so on.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:29.531
Dealing with values as well as keys is pretty straightforward.

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:35.139
First, if you have a value that's large in terms of bytes, it's usually smarter to make the value instead,

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:39.710
a pointer to the actual data, and then just sort the value and its pointer.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.599
For instance, if you had a large NBA player data structure, don't sort the whole data structure as the value.

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:48.618
Instead, just use a pointer to the data structure as the value.

00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:52.830
Second, our sort algorithms generally move around data keys,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.633
whether that be a sorting network, or a radix sort, or a merge.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:00.363
Instead of just moving the key, if you have to deal with a key value sort,

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:03.433
move the key and the value together as one unit.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:07.535
Finally, since today's GPUs can often natively handle 64-bit data,

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:14.045
it might make sense to use a 64-bit data type to store both a 32-bit key and a 32-bit value

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.782
and just change any comparison functions you have to input 64-bit values instead.
