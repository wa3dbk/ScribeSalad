Now you've seen observational studies where we correlated sleep and memory, and

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.103
you've learned about surveys where we asked people questions. And you've learned

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:14.869
about experiments which are our best bet for proving causality. For the most

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:19.566
part in this course, we're going to focus on observational studies. That's

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:24.351
because we can't exactly do a survey or experiment online. But we do think it's

00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:28.361
important for you to know the different kinds of studies that we use with

00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:32.712
statistics. Here at Udacity, we did our own little observational study which

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:37.041
we're going to share with you so that you can draw your own conclusions. By now,

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:41.359
you know my hand pretty well. You see it all the time when I'm writing out the

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:46.560
lessons. So now, you're going to use what you know about my hand, to know a

00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:51.380
little more about me. There's a link at the right called height and hand length

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:56.225
with real data on hand length and height of the people here at Udacity. Let's

00:00:56.237 --> 00:01:00.755
bring this data up. If we highlight the data, and then go up here to insert

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:06.857
chart. Go to Charts, and select Scatter. And we need to click here on Scatter

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.783
chart, and then click Insert. After you click Insert a scatter plot should pop

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:19.321
up that visualizes this data. You should see a clear relationship between height

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:25.024
and hand length. Based on this scatter plot, if I tell you my hand is 6.75

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:30.115
inches long How tall do you think I am? Write your answer in inches, since

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:35.333
that's how we measured hand length. Just take a guess. This doesn't affect your

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:40.503
grade. The purpose of this is for you to use patterns to make educated guesses.
