00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.820
With this lesson, we begin the second major unit of the course on software

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.750
architecture. Which is you recall, is the highest level of expression to

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.290
a design problem. In actual practice, software architecture and

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.230
industry usually amounts to the preparation of a slide for

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.000
display that contains some boxes and arrows depicting the major components of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.110
a system, and how they're connected together. We want to take a more

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.200
principled look at what this essential aspect of software design is all about.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.550
Here is such a diagram. The boxes depict major components of the system, and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.928
the arrows indicate some form of dependency among the boxes. It might be

00:00:42.928 --> 00:00:47.900
the flow of control, it might be the flow of data. The point being is that the,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.760
there's no actual semantics to the diagram that is universally accepted.
