00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.913
Step 4, copy each act of nodes edge list to this array.

00:00:03.913 --> 00:00:10.312
So vertex 1 copies its 3 element neighbor list into the output array, starting at offset 0,

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:13.550
and vertex 3 copies its only neighbor to offset 3.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.789
So the potential new frontier here are nodes 0, 2, 4, and 4.
