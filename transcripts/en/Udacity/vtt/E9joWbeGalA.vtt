00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.640
Responsive patterns are quickly
evolving, but there are a handful of

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.160
established patterns that work well,
across pretty much any device.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.046
Most patterns used by responsive web
pages can be categorized into one of

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:18.830
four patterns, mostly fluid, column
drop, layout shifter, and off canvas.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.200
In some cases, a page may use
a combination of patterns.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.110
For example, column drop and off canvas.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.270
In each of these examples, and

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.610
the examples moving forward, the colored
boxes represent areas of content.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.540
Let's break them down one by one.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.630
I'm going to show you how these
patterns work, and then using your

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.860
Flexbox skills and media queries, you're
going to practice implementing them.
