00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.470
Let us build on this metaphor of periodic table a little bit further.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.560
So earlier we came across another method of dealing with classification,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.630
which we call top down or establish define.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.390
In that method we had this classification hierarchy which start with a concept,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.940
will establish it, then refine it, and refine it further if needed.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.770
That particular control of processing is very well suited for

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.110
one kind of organization of concepts. It's very well suited for

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.170
one set of situations where we know something is already a vertebrate,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.820
we're trying to establish whether it's a bird or a bluebird. And a different

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.090
kind of classification task. A better control of processing is to go bottom up.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.820
Let's look at this a little bit more carefully. Here are a number of leaf nodes.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.000
And we know, the agent knows something about the value for

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.900
each of these leaf nodes. And the task is to make a prediction at the root node.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.030
So in this particular case imagine the task of the AA agent is to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.349
predict the of the Dow Jones Industrial Average tomorrow. It'll be great to

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.660
have an AA agent like that. If we had a good AA agent like that, you and

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.430
I could both become very rich. Now how could this A,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.270
agent make a prediction about the Dow Jones Industrial Average tomorrow?

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.480
Well, one way in which it could do it is it could look at the.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.930
Information it has about the GDP the inflation and

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.800
employment today. but how does it know about the value GDP or the inflation or

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.890
employment today. Well it can look then at the values of the overtime hours.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.470
The consumer sentiment index, new orders index and so on and so forth.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.730
Now, the processing is largely, bottom up. We know something about the values or

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.460
the features that go into this concept.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.230
And they're going to this concept, they're going to this concept.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.390
You can abstract them and find the value of the GDP. And similarly for this, and

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.710
then abstract it further. So the control of processing in this particular case,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.645
we might call it identify and abstract, identify an abstract.

00:01:54.645 --> 00:02:00.040
Bottom-up controller processing rather than top-down in the previous case.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.700
We have just defined two other elements of our periodic table,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.038
of our growing periodic table of intelligence. In this latter element,

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:12.050
the bottom-up classification, the conditions of application are different.
