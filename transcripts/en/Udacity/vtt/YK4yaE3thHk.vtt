00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
So the first one is obviously correct.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.800
So far, we have not found a polynomial time algorithm for the three problems here.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.930
We've shown in the last unit that they are practically relevant or at least

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.680
slightly simplified versions of highly relevant problems.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.460
All of the simple problems go through an exponential number of solutions.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.870
That's what made all of those simple algorithm so bad and their running time--

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.130
all led to the exponential running time, but the thing is going through that exponential

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.910
number of 0-1 assignments is also what made those problems hard to solve.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.360
If you have given a certain assignment, checking if that is valid and how large it is--

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.780
for example, if it's better than a solution you have found so far--that is relatively easy.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.680
It's doable in polynomial time.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.600
Now, the answers to this quiz might seem rather obvious to you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.220
and you might be wondering what we're going to do with those answers,

00:00:47.220 --> 99:59:59.000
but I promise you it will all make sense very soon.
