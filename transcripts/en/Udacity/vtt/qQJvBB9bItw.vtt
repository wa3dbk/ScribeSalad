Back to quizzes involving the interpreter.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'd like you to write me a short Python program that for all numbers x

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
between 0 and 99 prints x cubed, that is x times x times x,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but only if x itself is even and x cubed is less than 20.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For example, 2 is even, and 2 times 2 is 4 times 2 again is 8, that's less than 20,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so I would definitely want to print out 8 among potentially other numbers.

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And the hint is use a list comprehension. This can be done very concisely.
