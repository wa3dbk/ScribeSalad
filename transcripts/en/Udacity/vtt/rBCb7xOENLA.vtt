00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.348
So, this is our third and last type of system. When we have two equations that

00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:08.993
are identical, the lines overlap. They have an infinite number of intersections

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:13.356
or solutions, so every x and y will satisfy both of the equations. For our car

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:17.701
companies, this just meant that it didn't matter where I got my car from. I'd

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.694
always have to pay the same amount.
