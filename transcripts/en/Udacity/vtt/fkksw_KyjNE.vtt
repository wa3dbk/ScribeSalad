00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Narrator] The answer is 19.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Some of this we need to compute the key space.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well, the key is just a permutation of the alphabet.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have 26 choices for what A could map to.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We have 25 choices for what B could map to.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We have 24 choices for what C could map to and so on through the alphabet.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is equal to 26 factorial, which I won't attempt to write out but will show you in python.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's define a factorial function, and we get this rather large number.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What we need to know now is how this compares to the message space.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The number of possible messages of length N,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
while each letter in the message can be any letter in the alphabet.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That's just 26 to the N.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We're going to find the first number N, where 26 to the N exceeds factorial 26,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we get 19, and we can confirm that.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That 26 to the N is indeed greater than factorial of 26;

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
26 to the 18 is less than it though.
