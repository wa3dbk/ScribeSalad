00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.325
So, when talking about imitation, we see the nature side. In that, all the

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:07.939
children began to speak at about the same time. And they were able to use

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.141
language as functional tool. And we also see the nurture side. And this was the

00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:16.930
number of words that children were exposed to based on their family type. And

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.469
also whether they heard more encouraging words or discouraging words. So, the

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:24.507
important point to take home here is that we should try to expose our little

00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:29.910
ones to as many words as possible, to increase their vocabulary. You may ask

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
why is vocabulary important? Well, Hart and Risley found an interesting study.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.196
They found a strong positive correlation between children's vocabulary size at

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:43.760
age three and their language test scores at age nine and ten. Now remember that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.444
this is a correlational study, so we can't see there was a cause and effect

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:51.009
relationship. But it is a nice demonstration of how powerful different

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.470
environments are in terms of language development.
