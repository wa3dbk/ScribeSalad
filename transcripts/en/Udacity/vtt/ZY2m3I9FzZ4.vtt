00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.660
I covered the core of the checklist.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.430
But there are a couple of things
I didn't walk you through.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.300
Custom view controls and
custom accessibility services.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.250
For any custom views that you create for
your app, you'll want to

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.850
implement the accessibility interfaces
to support the native features.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.590
Beyond that, developers may build
their own accessibility services,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.120
which can provide enhanced usability
features, such as audio prompting,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.250
physical feedback, and
alternative navigation modes.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910
Accessibility services can
provide these enhancements for

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.860
all applications, a set of applications,
or just a single app.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.730
This means that custom services you
build can be used by other apps, or that

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.400
your app might be able to use someone
else's custom accessibility feature.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.120
So be sure to cover all of
your accessibility bases.
