00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.056
With magnification we've found that if a texel covered too many pixels, we

00:00:03.056 --> 00:00:06.176
could just make our original checkered texter larger and larger so that about

00:00:06.176 --> 00:00:11.296
one texel covered one pixel. With minification we'd like each pixel to cover no

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:15.106
more than one texel. The GPU has built into it, special functionality that

00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:19.497
implements an algorithm called mip mapping. With mip mapping the GPU computes

00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:24.128
approximately what the texel to pixel ratio is. If this ratio is less than one

00:00:24.128 --> 00:00:29.480
Magnification happens and the mag filter takes effect. If this ratio is greater

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.714
than one, minification is happening. This is where mid mapping comes in. What

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:38.155
the GPU does, is determines the ratio of texels to pixels. If this ratio gets

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:41.494
much larger than one to one A lower resolution version of the texture is used

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:46.544
instead. As this ratio gets higher and higher, a lower and lower resolution of

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:51.810
the texture gets used. These textures can be thought of as forming a pyramid.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.204
For example, say a pixel needs the texture color. Instead of taking whatever

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:59.050
texel happens to cover the center of the pixel down at the bottom level. The

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.770
GPU determines the texel to pixel ratio for this pixel to see how high up the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.725
pyramid to go. The texture at this level of the pyramid is then sampled. Since

00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:11.958
the ratio of texels to pixels is about one to one for this lower resolution

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:17.894
texture, the rendering looks much better without the noise we saw before. In

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:20.667
fact, for even better quality rendering, we can set the GPU to linearly

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:26.741
interpolate between levels. This is called trilinear filtering. Say our ratio

00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:30.590
is in between two pyramid levels. We then sample the texture above and below

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.442
from where our sample is in the pyramid, and interpolate between these two

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:39.137
samples. My example pyramid was not drawn to scale. Within the GPU, the pyramid

00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:44.034
is created and stored in powers of 2. That is, if you start with a texture

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:48.192
that's 64 by 64, the pyramid is formed with this texture, a 32 by 32 texture, a

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:55.190
16 by 16 texture, 8 by 8. Four by four, two by two and one by one at the end.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.328
This sort of textures is called the mipmap pyramid or the mipmap chain. Each

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:02.514
smaller texture is derived from the larger one. One technique is to simply

00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:05.842
average the four texels of the larger texture to make the smaller which can be

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:10.830
done in advance or by the GPU itself. There are some subtleties, such as gamma

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.300
correction, that can change how these levels are formed. That's for a later

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.165
lesson. This is an important point, so pay attention. You want to make your

00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:23.482
textures to be powers of two in size, both in rows and columns. You will not be

00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:26.745
able to use mipmapping if you don't. GPUs generally expect powers of two, so

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:29.753
don't disappoint them, unless you know what you're doing and have a very good

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:34.502
reason for doing so. Give the new version of the demo a try. You can now pick

00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:37.483
mipmapping as a filtering option for minification.
