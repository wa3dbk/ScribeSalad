00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.656
But what happens when a person takes a drug? That is, why do some people take

00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:09.389
drugs again and again and sometimes to access? We do know that genetics can

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.955
play a role in how reinforcing a drug's effect is for an individual. Now, a

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:19.755
drug reinforcer Is any drug that produces effects that cause or result in the

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:26.660
person taking the drug again. Drugs of abuse are termed positive reinforcers.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.756
We'll discuss reinforcers in more detail in our lesson on learning, which is

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:35.804
the next lesson. One factor that plays a major role in the reinforcing

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:39.769
effectiveness of a drugs action Is the root of administration that the drug is

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.846
delivered. The faster the onset of a drug's action, the greater reinforcing

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:51.941
effects. So injecting and inhaling routes are more reinforcing. In the oral

00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:55.540
route, because the drug enters the central nervous system faster during

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.162
injecting and inhaling. Now, for the oral route, the drug has a path through

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:03.690
the digestive system and compete for metabolism for whatever else is in the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.072
stomach. For example, pizza or cheeseburger. Thus the drug takes longer to

00:01:09.072 --> 00:01:13.730
reach the sites of action in the central nervous system when taken orally.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.202
Here, let's look at these a little closer. Injecting drugs is one of the

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:23.681
fastest and most dangerous routes of administration for a variety of reasons.

00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:28.595
Including the increased risk of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and AIDS,

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:34.969
hepatitis In collapsing of veins after long time injecting. Inhalation or

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.190
smoking over an extended period of time can result in damage to the lungs and

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.900
bronchi, and sometimes results in coughing fits and increased mucus production.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.620
Other roots of administration include snorting, or even transdermal patches.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.097
You're most likely aware of nicotine patches that are used as a method for

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:59.618
quitting smoking. Patches allow for extended release of the drug. There are

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:03.258
even patches for powerful pain reducing drugs that are used for the treatment

00:02:03.258 --> 00:02:07.050
of some cancers. But now, let's switch gears, and talk a little bit about the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.820
brain.
