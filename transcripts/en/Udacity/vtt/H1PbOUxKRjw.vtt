00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.920
So let's return to our memory management subsystem.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.810
And of course the whole idea of objectization

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.740
of the memory management subsystem, or any subsystem

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.630
for that matter, is to increase the concurrency for

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.880
system services that we're going to offer for

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.170
the threads that are executing on the processors.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.330
So in the memory management subsystem, the main

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.320
service that we're offering is the page fault service.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.160
And let's say that in this example, there are

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.130
two threads T1 and T2. Let's assume that they've

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.370
been mapped to the same processor, which means with

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.470
the objectization that I described to you they are sharing

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.910
a process object. So if T1 incurs a page

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.610
fault it's going to through the process object to the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.990
region that corresponds to this particular page fault. And

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.450
now let's think about what needs to happen in order

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.410
to service this page fault. We might do hierarchical

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.550
lockings or for instance if I want to do

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.870
some modifications to the region object to indicate that

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.420
I'm modifying the data structure that corresponds to this

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.950
portion of the address piece, I might say that

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.850
well, let's lock the process object. Let's lock the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.000
region object that it corresponds to. Let, let's lock

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.460
the FCM object that is backed by this region.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.200
And let's lock the COR object that are actually going to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.600
do the I/O for me. If I do this, and now

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.260
let's say the operating system is incurring a page fault

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.400
for this second thread P T2. And let's say that this

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.370
page fault because it is happening on the same processor,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.650
it shares the same process object, but maybe this page fault

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.430
is not for this region, but it is for a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.600
different region, let's say region 2. But if we have locked

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.520
the process object in servicing this page fault,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.640
then we cannot get past this process object, because

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.590
the lock is held on behalf of servicing

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.440
this particular page fault. And therefore, the operating system

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.860
cannot process this page fault, even though you

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.940
may have multiple cores on the processor. And these

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.170
threads are executing on different cores of the same

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.650
processor. You don't have the concurrency that you wanted.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.560
So this hierarchical locking kills concurrency and that's a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.730
bad idea. So, what you don't want to do is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.260
do this hierarchical locking. But it seems like, in order

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.640
to service this page fault, if I want integrity for

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.250
these objects, I want to be able to lock

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.160
the critical data structures. But if the path that is

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.010
taken by this page fault is different from the path

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.660
that is taken by this page fault, why lock this

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.500
object in the first place? So we don't have to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.600
lock this object because the path taken by the page

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.790
fault service is different from this, and so hierarchical locking

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.240
is a bad idea. It kills concurrency. But you do need

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.680
integrity of this process object, and in particular if the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.060
reason why we locked this process object is in some sense

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.470
to ensure that this process object doesn't go away. How

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.680
can it go away? Well, one of the things that can

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.010
happen under the covers while page fault service is

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.860
happening, there could be a decision to migrate a process

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.880
from one processor to another processor. And if that

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.540
happens, then the process object may be migrated. And that's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.410
the reason that you have to worry about the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.820
integrity of this process object. When something is happening that

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.970
is going to modify something in this process object, you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.800
don't want this process object to go away. That's actually

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.920
to do with existence guarantee. So, what we're

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.130
going to do is, we're going to associate a

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.540
reference count with the object, and rather than

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.240
do hierarchical locking, what we're going to do is

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.980
put an existence guarantee. Every time this object

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.200
is being used, there's a reference count that is

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.410
associated with that, and the reference count is

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.000
a way of guaranteeing the existence of this object.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.720
So, let's come back to this example again. So if T1

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.030
has a page fault, it first go to this, goes to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.210
this process object before it goes to the region object, because

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.270
this particular page fault is going to be serviced through this region

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.910
object path, but it is not going to hold lock on

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.080
this object. What it is going to do is, it is

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.850
going to increment a reference count for this object, saying that

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.740
this object is in use, please don't get rid of it. And,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.529
subsequently, if this page fault happens, accesses the same

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.589
process object, it's also going to increment the reference count.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.800
It is not going to lock this object because

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.440
its path is different. It is going through this path

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.750
in order to service its page fault, which is

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.330
for a completely different page. The whole point of having

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.940
a reference count is now, if let's say some

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.200
other entity in the operating system, such as a process

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.850
migration facility that says, I need to balance the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.420
load on this multiprocessor by moving some process from

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.610
this processor to a different one. If it looks

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.250
at this process object and it will say well,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.540
I cannot touch this process object, because its reference

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.460
count is not zero. Which means that this process

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.640
object is currently servicing some requests locally. And that

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.490
is the way we can, we can ensure the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.990
existence guarantee for this objects and integrity of

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.880
this, of this object. And that can allow

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.100
us to get rid of hierarchical locking and

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.470
promote concurrency for service activities that can be

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.900
provided by the operating system for the same

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.840
service, but where there is concurrency that is

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.980
possible. In this case page fault service that

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.750
can be happening in parallel for independent regions of

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.730
the address space touched by the threads that are running on the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.280
same processor, but executing on different cores perhaps of the same processor.
