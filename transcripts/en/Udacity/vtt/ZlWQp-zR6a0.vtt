00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.290
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here are our answers. You've learned that inequalities have ranges of values

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.602
that are solutions to them. So that means that if a number falls in this range,

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.840
we can use it in the inequality to make a true statement. Some of these may be a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.449
bit confusing though. For example, 3 is less than or equal to 7. On a number

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.985
line, if we're curious about all of the numbers that are less than or equal to

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:26.387
7, we would shade in all the numbers to the left of 7 on the number line. And

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:30.630
then draw a square bracket to include 7 in that range. We can see that 3

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.922
definitely falls in this region. It is not equal to 7, but it is less than 7.

00:00:35.922 --> 00:00:40.568
And it only needs to fit one of the criteria implied by this symbol. It either

00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:45.325
needs to be less than 7, or it needs to be equal to 7. Similarly, the statement

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:49.809
8 is greater than or equal to 1 plus 7 is also true. When simplified, this of

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.472
course gives us the inequality 8 is greater than or equal to 8. And you might at

00:00:54.472 --> 00:00:58.754
first think, oh my gosh, 8 is not greater than 8. However it only needs to be

00:00:58.754 --> 00:01:02.902
greater than or equal to 8. It's equal to 8 so that's enough to satisfy this

00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:07.106
inequality. We can see the difference here then, between this symbol, the

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:11.528
greater than or equal to, which implies inclusion of 8, versus the just greater

00:01:11.528 --> 00:01:16.606
than sign. This statement is true. Whereas this statement is not, because 8 is

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:22.150
greater than 1 plus 7, only allows for the greater than criterion, not the equal

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.002
to one. 1 plus 7 no longer fits the bill.
