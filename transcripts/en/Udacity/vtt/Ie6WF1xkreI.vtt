00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.270
So let me introduce some terms here.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.350
One, first term I want introduce is Exposure.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.100
Now if you notice in lenses,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.090
we basically can open the lens to be really small, or much wider.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.990
But just having this kind of a change on how big I want the size of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.800
the aperture, which is the opening here.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.320
I can now vary a lot of different types of things.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.420
So now, let's see what impact does aperture have on exposure.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.549
If we define aperture by capital H, basically what we're interested in is that

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:40.460
exposure is equal to irradiance times the time that the exposure was open.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.530
We can simply write this equation down as H, where the h is the exposure,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.170
irradiance, we define by term E, and time by T.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.570
Basically, an exposure is irradiance on the sensor, for

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.780
the amount of time that it was hitting the sensor.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.860
That is basically, the amount of light that’s coming in and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.640
hitting the sensor for, and how long defines exposure.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.180
So what is irradiance?

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.780
So again, irradiance, in essence, is the amount of light, the measure of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.020
amount of light that falls on the unit area of a sensor per second.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.320
And it's denoted by capital E here.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.570
So the amount of light that will hit a sensor depends on

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.170
the opening of the aperture.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.550
So in essence it's controlled by the aperture size.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.140
Here a small opening.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.390
A larger opening, of course,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.990
larger opening will let a lot more amount of light per unit area of the sensor.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.140
And this of course, will have a lot less light going through.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.380
And of course, exposure time is the timing that we allow the light to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.780
go through this opening or that opening.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.780
That is best designated by the, how long the shutter is kept open.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.930
So now we've looked at aperture, which is the opening.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.870
And shutter is basically how long we keep this open.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.280
That let's me get to the exposure that I'm am interested in for an image.
