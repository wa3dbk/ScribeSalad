00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.453
Again, we have to find the z scores for each of these. The z score slightly

00:00:04.453 --> 00:00:09.974
changes because our sample size is now 50 instead of 30. Now our z score here

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:16.768
becomes about 0.97, which is still outside the critical region. But the z score

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:23.380
for our sample mean is as high as 2.44, approximately. And that's in our

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.720
critical region. In this case, based on the results of our sample, we would

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.236
reject the null. However, we're pretending that the new population parameter

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:39.456
will be outside the critical region, close to the old population parameter. In

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:43.791
this case, we would reject the null, when the null is actually true. Then we're

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:48.395
committing a Type I error. In this case, it just so happened that we randomly

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:54.110
selected a sample of students who were already really engaged. After all, that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.720
is possible. There's a 2.5% chance that we get a mean with a z score greater

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.400
that 1.96.
