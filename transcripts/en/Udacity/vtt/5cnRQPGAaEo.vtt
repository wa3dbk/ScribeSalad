00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.526
We heard a lot of information in the last
video, so here is just a summary of all of

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:08.733
that on one screen. We can think about
Grant's sales story so far as having two

00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:13.281
situations. The situation after the first
day, which I'm going to call the before

00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:17.682
picture and the situation after the second
day of selling, which is the present

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:22.646
situation we're concerned with. The last
equation that we came up with, a = 36w +

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:27.426
22n had to do with just the sales from the
first day. So, I changed the name of the

00:00:27.438 --> 00:00:32.561
total money earned to a old to show that
this is the money earned after the first

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.643
day of selling. This equation still works
if we're only interested in calculating

00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:41.012
the money that Grant earned from his
friends after just that one day, but now,

00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:45.843
we want to find, is what I'm going to call
a new. The money he's going to get from

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:50.537
those people and from these new people who
also want to buy. What we're going to do

00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:54.793
in this quiz is come up with an equation
for a new, which should combine the

00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:59.463
information from a old with this new data
about people who are also going to buy the

00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:04.626
wipers and nozzles. So, which of these
equations down at the bottom is the

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:09.467
correct equation for a new? The total
amount of money that Grent will have after

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:14.802
these people on the first day buy his
wipers and nozzles, and these people from

00:01:14.814 --> 00:01:19.726
the second day buy his wipers and nozzles.
This is a lot of information to take in, so

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:24.744
I'm going to lable this quiz a challenge
quiz. Actually many of the quizzes that

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:27.708
you've had have been challenging, but I
think that this one is especially

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:31.968
difficult. Think really carefully about
how many terms you think this new equation

00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:36.516
should have. Should it have two terms or
should it have four terms? Also, there may be

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:40.235
more than one correct answer. Even if you
don't get it right the first time, just

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:41.421
give it another shot.
