00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.550
Today, I'm talking with Dr.
Rahul Basole, Associate Professor in

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.750
the School of Interactive Computing here
at Georgia Tech and a colleague of mine.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.820
He and I actually worked together on the
research we're going to be describing.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.780
Rahul, you're also the Director
of the Tennenbaum Institute

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.580
here at Georgia Tech.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.948
Can you tell us about that?

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:22.060
&gt;&gt; Sure, the Tennenbaum Institute is a
multidisciplinary research institute at

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.170
Georgia Tech that draws on all
colleges here at the university.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.140
And we're fundamentally interested in
how large, complex enterprises change

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.800
and we use a systems engineering
approach to study that.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.010
&gt;&gt; And we were really brought
together when you decided to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.770
use that approach to model the Center
for Health Discovery and Well Being,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.720
a joint Emory/Georgia Tech project,
that helps people who have

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.120
risks of developing chronic
disease later in life.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.200
Change their lifestyles and behavior
in order to litigate those risks.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.710
We actually developed a business
strategy using this model and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.870
we fit the needs of
all the stakeholders.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.599
Doing this required modeling
all these interests.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.750
Can you describe how that was done?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.520
&gt;&gt; Certainly.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.860
So this particular model
involved a four level approach.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.380
Which consists of people, processes,
organizations and the ecosystem.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.020
And there are interactions that occur
within and across these levels.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.140
Each of these levels really
represents a stakeholder as well.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.330
So at the people level,
we would look at providers and patients.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.560
At the process level,
we would look at how these healthcare

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
processes are actually delivered,
which are often delivered by one or

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.010
more organizations to
third level in the model.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.760
And ultimately,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.060
they are ecosystemic forces that
impact all of these different levels.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.250
&gt;&gt; Now the students are familiar with
the various approaches to modeling and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.830
simulation.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.520
So can you tell us which
approach was used at each level?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.360
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.140
So, we did use
a multi-simulation paradigm

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.930
to approach this
particularly enterprise.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.450
So at the people level, we used
an agent based modeling approach.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.330
Processes tend to be model as
discreet event simulation.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.750
But we also found that later on,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.680
that agent based simulation was
actually quite appropriate.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.908
The other two layers were done both with
systems dynamics, but all is age and

00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:15.450
base modeling approaches.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.050
&gt;&gt; So a mixture of different approaches?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.780
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.100
&gt;&gt; In one model?

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.600
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.020
&gt;&gt; So I know, because I was involved,
how difficult and

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.180
time consuming it was to get
the process layer defined.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.840
Have you found that to be the case
in other healthcare projects and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.540
what do you think is different about
healthcare that makes its processes so

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.380
different, so difficult to pin down?

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.900
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.330
It's quite remarkable how
complex healthcare is.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.680
So we found that process
modeling in itself in health

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.980
care is quite challenging,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.240
as compared to other domains,
where it's actually very well defined.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.130
Manufacturing is probably
the best example, where

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.300
you have well defined processes, and you
know how wages flow through the system.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.280
In health care, you have enormous amount
of stakeholders have come together,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.490
you have teams and collaborations, you
have patients moving through the system,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.460
and all of that is sort of distributed
both geographically and also temporally,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.610
and that makes process modeling
quite challenging with health care.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.479
&gt;&gt; Collecting the discreet data
about events is also a challenge.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.890
As opposed to manufacturing.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.970
Can you talk about that a minute?

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.260
&gt;&gt; Certainly.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.850
So I think that with an increasing
amount of digital data now in

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.850
healthcare as well,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.220
it's still quite challenging to really
clearly lay out how processes happen.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.240
So we can leverage lots of
different data sources with that.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.060
Administrative data, clinical data,
but even that, can be very noisy,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.090
can be very messy.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.170
Sometimes there's missing data as well.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.400
And then actually identifying sequences
of events in health care data

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.360
is actually very, very difficult.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.760
&gt;&gt; So, we're now exploring a more
automated approach to that

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.190
called process mining.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.850
Can you explain how that works?

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.410
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.930
Process mining really has its roots
in the European academic disciplines.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.250
What they have done is they have
used data mining approaches and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.400
visualization to infer
processes from digital data.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.630
And it involves lots of
sophisticated analytical tools.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.860
And the idea is that,

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.640
can we use digital data to sequence
together how events map out?

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.000
&gt;&gt; So we've done some
preliminary work on that,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.270
in the treatment of pediatric
asthma in the emergency department.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.380
Can you tell us how that worked out?

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.920
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.250
So we used digital data for

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.900
roughly 6,000 pediatric asthma patients,
and the idea was to obviously

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.850
identify variations in care by patient
strata, but also by providers and

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.250
the idea was to identify variations
in cost, quality and outcomes.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.470
We have developed a tool, a visual
analytic tool, that could actually map

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.840
different processes and allows you
to filter by different criteria,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.630
across patient strata, providers,
patient demographic data.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.100
And this visual analytic tool can
be used by clinicians to explore

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.980
how processes are delivered, where there
might be actual differences in care,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.490
and potentially, how to improve them.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.090
&gt;&gt; So I'm sure the students at this
point, near the end of the course,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.190
can appreciate just how challenging what

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.450
Rahul just described is to do in
practice, given all of the problems

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.180
we've discussed throughout the course
in terms of the interoperability of

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.150
the systems from which the data
needs to be collected.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.330
The differences in the way
the data's represented,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.240
the data quality as we
mentioned a few minutes ago.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.950
A really exciting area and
you should stay tuned,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.770
see what we end up doing in a few years.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.660
Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
