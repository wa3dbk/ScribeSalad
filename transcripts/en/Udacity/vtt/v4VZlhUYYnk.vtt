It depends on the kind of failure. If there's a

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.080
network failure to the name node, then the data would be

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.942
temporarily inaccessible. If the disk on the single name node

00:00:10.942 --> 00:00:14.590
were to fail, the data in HDFS could be lost forever.
