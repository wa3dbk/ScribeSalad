00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.710
Let's consider a different case. Supposing we have a case Z of going back from

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.810
the restaurant or the home. Let's also suppose that we're change our index equal

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.780
Kim. Now we are indexing things by the x square coordinates of the destination

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.450
not the origin. What will be the indices for the case Z?
