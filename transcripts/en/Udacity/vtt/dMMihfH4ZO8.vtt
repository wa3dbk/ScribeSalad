00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.410
Next we have affiliate marketing.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.100
This is a way for

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.560
a company to sell it's product by having
other people market it for a commission.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.170
If you join another company's affiliate
program, usually wanting to pay up front

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.810
only when people buy your product or
service through the other company.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.060
For example,
say you're on a crafting blog and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.290
you see a link to Amazon to
buy craft related products.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.750
That is affiliate marketing in action.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.510
If you were to buy what Amazon
was advertising on the blog,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.630
you, the owner of the blog,
will get a percentage of the sale price.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.880
There are businesses that are working
with thousands of affiliates.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.940
And their lead generation
relies on these concepts.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.790
Other businesses are playing
as the affiliate and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.500
building their business
model as an affiliate.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.090
For you to begin with,
if it's not your core business model,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.670
you can start with a few partners
that can start as your affiliates and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.860
you pay them per lead or per conversion.
