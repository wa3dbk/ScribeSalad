00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.634
Now for the last method we'll write for the friend's class, at least for this

00:00:02.634 --> 00:00:07.222
lesson. It's possible right now for John to have TJ as a friend and TJ not to

00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:12.230
have John back. Let's write a method, removeMeanFriends, that removes all of

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.995
the friends that don't like John back. So for example, if John has friends, TJ,

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:25.670
Maria, Jamesha and Joe. Let's say Jamesha and Joe both like John back, but TJ

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.296
and Maria don't. So we want to remove TJ and Maria from John's friends list. So

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:37.422
in this case we'll start with TJ at index zero. So we'll remove TJ from the

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:41.766
list. Now the list gets re-indexed. To look at the next person in the list we

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:45.770
need to look at the zeroth person again. So we can't just have a counter

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.225
variable that we increment by one each time. We look at Maria and Maria also

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:54.028
doesn't like John. So we'll remove Maria and the rest of the list will get

00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:58.000
re-indexed again. So yet again to look at the next person we have to look at

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.597
the zeroth person. We look at Jamesha and Jamesha likes John, so she should

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:06.840
stay in the list. We'll increment the counter and look at the next person. Joe

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.736
likes John, so we'll keep Joe in the list. So we should increment the counter

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:14.582
variable and look at the next person, which would be at index two. But two is

00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:18.860
no longer a valid index. Even though it was, originally. So we're done.
