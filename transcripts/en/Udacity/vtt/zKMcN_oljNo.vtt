00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Evans] For this quiz your goal is to define a procedure, named sum_list,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that takes as its input a list of numbers

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and produces as its output the sum of all the elements in the input list.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So here's an example.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If we pass in the list containing the three numbers 1, 7, and 4,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the result of the call to sum_list should be 1 + 7 + 4, which is 12.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
See if you can define sum_list using the for-loop that we've just introduced.
