00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.520
So the specific objectives
of this lesson are for

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.740
us to dive deeper into the Harris
corner detector algorithm.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.690
Now, we have already
looked at it briefly.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.570
Here we are going to talk about
the various steps that go into making

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.570
the Harris corner detector algorithm,
and

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.390
also look at a variety of differences
and variants on the basic algorithm,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.570
that'll help us understand how
we can do feature detection.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.730
In addition, I will also describe
the more widely used SIFT algorithm,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.370
which is actually pretty much used on
most softwares that actually do any kind

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.230
of feature deduction and matching.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.490
Just to recall, our goal is to
start off with two images and

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.740
our interest is to find features
in these images, like these.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.370
And then also, find features in
another image in an image pair.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.501
And then match them, saying this
is the same feature as that one.

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:50.010
So finding the similar features
across two images is our goal.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.120
And to do this, we have been spending
a lot of time, actually from

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.090
the earliest lectures, trying to
learn how we can get inside and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.510
find repeatable features
that actually can be

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.410
detected more reliably across images,
even though the images might be changed.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.560
In this case, the change is subtle.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.360
Just a pan from one view to the other.
