00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.660
What did you write, David?

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.710
&gt;&gt; So I can tell that the first
thing the robot is going to have

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.270
to do to paint this ceiling
is climb the ladder.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.500
So I'm first going to apply
the climb ladder operator,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.920
that's going to result in
the robot being on the ladder, but

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.264
the state of the ladder and
the ceiling haven't changed.

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:16.855
And then now that the robot is on the
ladder, it'll apply the paint ceiling

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:20.047
operator, which results in painted
ceiling added to the state and

00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:21.910
the dry ceiling negated.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.660
&gt;&gt; That's good, David.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.340
So this is the structure
of the final plan.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.870
Another question to ask here is how
might a robot come up with such a plan?

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.220
So let's do the same thing that
we have done here earlier.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.730
We're going to use goal as a control
knowledge to select an operator.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.120
So we know that we want to
have the ceiling painted.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.540
So the question then becomes
of the available operators,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.400
which operator has a post
condition painted ceiling.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.915
And the only operator who's
post-condition ceiling is the operator,

00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:52.920
paint-celiling.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.080
So we set up that operator.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.726
So we're working backwards here.

00:00:55.726 --> 00:01:00.148
Painted-ceiling was a good condition, we
selected paint-ceiling as the operator.

00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:03.500
But this paint-ceiling now
has some pre conditions.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.220
One of the pre conditions
is On Robot Ladder,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.790
which is different from
On Robot Floor in the initial state.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.190
So now the question becomes,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.330
how can we achieve this sub
goal of Robot on Ladder?

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.640
If we use that sub goal as
the control knowledge, then we want

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.180
to select an operator whose post
conditions will match this top goal and

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.070
that operator is climb ladder.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.940
So now we have that
climb ladder here and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.830
the preconditions of climb ladder
match this initial state and

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.180
that is how we get to this plan,
climb ladder and paint ceiling.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.740
So we were working backwards
using goal knowledge

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.210
as control knowledge to
select between operators.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.000
&gt;&gt; So note that we just made
a connection back to problem

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.680
reduction that we talked about
right after means and analysis.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.710
Ashok in his description talked about
the sub goal of getting up the ladder.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.420
When we talked about
problem reduction earlier,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.890
we talked about the need to break big
problems down into smaller problems.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.360
But we didn't exactly talk about how
an agent would go about doing that.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.510
Here we see one way in which an agent
would go about actually identifying

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.690
those subgoals in order to
accomplish the final goal.
