00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.940
Okay, so I trust that you know how to add an image to this button.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.370
What I will do however,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.087
is walk you through how to add constraints to this image.

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:11.280
I Ctrl + drag from the button in this direction and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.650
selected the option called Top Space, and then Ctrl + dragged from

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.010
the button in this direction and selected Leading Space as the option.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.270
Now I've added two constraints here.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.890
If I select any one of them, and then go to the utility area.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.770
I can look under Size Inspector to see that the value of this constraint is

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.710
a constant 50 points from the top.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.990
If I select the other constraint I can see that it's value is

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.900
a constant 30 points from the leading edge.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.550
After that I went to the assistant editor and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.490
in there I created a new action called Play Slow audio.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.430
Now, this function gets executed any time someone presses this button over here.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.140
So now, I can write code to play audio in this function.
