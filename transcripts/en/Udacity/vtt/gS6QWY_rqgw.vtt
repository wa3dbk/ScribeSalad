00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
By now, we have a nice cartoonish model of a car, but there's lots of issue

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to consider to make this model really life-like.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First thing to mention, the car can turn left and right. Our model should be able to do the same.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This should be including a lateral motion. Each of the four wheels is not an exact cylinder.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The cross section of a wheel is not a circle. The wheel is deformed as it touches the ground.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The wheels are mounted with the help of some suspension, which may oscillating,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and there's interaction between the wheels.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What happens with one wheel may influence all three other wheels.

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In the next quiz, we're looking at one mechanism for such a sort of interaction between the wheels.
