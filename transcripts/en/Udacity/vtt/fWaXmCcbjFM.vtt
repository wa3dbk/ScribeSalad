00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
How do we even get started?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
One of the common tricks for a school or exam or test questions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is to work from the bottom, up

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and see if there's extra information you can glean.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(x + something) has to be equal to (z)--ah, not super handy yet.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Something is exactly equal to "hello".

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, wait--right up here we assigned: y = "hello".

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So as long as I don't overwrite (y) with 2, this should totally work:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
y = "hello" because we just did the assignment

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a few lines up.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
All right. Now let's take a look at the rest of these.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I need to add something to (x)--to get (z)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that suggests that (x) is smaller than (z)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because we don't have any negative numbers to play with in this example.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So I'm going to have to add something like 1 or 2 or whatnot to (x) to get (z).

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, if I really think that (x) is less than (z),

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
then this line is probably True.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But in order for this to print out True and not give some sort of error,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm going to have to assign to the value (x) and the value (z) before I get here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So one of these will have to be (x) and one of them will have to be (z).

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Since I want (x) to be smaller,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
let's try this out: (x) is 1; (z) is 2.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
All right. So then 1 is Less Than 2--that's going to be True.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
y = "hello"--that's going to be True.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And now we have: print x + (something) is equal to z.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Well, (x) is 1 and (z) is 2, so we'd really like to just write "1" in here--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but remember the rules of this puzzle--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we can only write x, y, or z so we'll write another (x).

00:01:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Since (x) is 1, (1 + 1) equals 2.
