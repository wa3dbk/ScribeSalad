00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.208
Here are our filled-in versions of our tables. Looking at the numbers we wrote

00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:07.088
in for y here, and comparing them to this table, and then looking at these

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:11.396
numbers for y. And comparing them to this table, there's definitely something

00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:14.976
pretty interesting going on here. Let's take a peek at the graphs of these

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:19.352
functions to maybe get a better idea of what that is. Here are the graphs of

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:25.267
our two functions. This red one shows y equals 10x plus 150, and the purplish

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:31.155
one shows y equals x over 10 minus 15. Start to see if you can pick up a

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.600
pattern relating the points on this line to the points on this line, using both

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.499
the tables and the graph here.
