Okay, let's try a quiz on this information. Okay, which of the following are

00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:09.233
equal to negative 9? Is it 3 to the negative 2, the negative of 3 squared, the

00:00:09.245 --> 00:00:14.239
quantity negative 3 squared, 1/3 squared, the negative of 1/3 to the negative 2,

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:18.535
or negative 1/3rd squared. Okay, I know this looks like a lot of negatives, but

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:22.540
if you work though it slowly, you can probably figure out what everything means,

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:26.530
and get to the right answer. This is a tough quiz, so take your time, and work

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:27.430
through it slowly.
