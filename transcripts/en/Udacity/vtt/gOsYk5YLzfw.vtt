00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.880
Phase two induced with setting up
IPsec SA which is a one way association.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.660
But multiple IPsec SA's
can be negotiated with

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.350
the protection of the same
IKE SA established in phase one.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.130
The phase two protocol looks very
similar to the phase one protocol.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.860
The difference is in how
the IPSec keys are derived.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.380
If there's no perfect
forward secrecy is required,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.390
then these keys can be derived
from one of the shared keys,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.530
specifically the SKID-T
computed in phase one.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.225
The weakness is that,
if that key is somehow leaked,

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:44.150
then all the IPSec SA
keys are also leaked.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.930
Stronger security requires
perfect forward secrecy.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.320
In this case,
both sides exchange new nonce values and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.470
perform new Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.930
With perfect forward secrecy,
each time an IPSec SA is negotiated,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.920
its keys are created using
the pre-shared key, and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.050
the new information that
has been exchanged.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.354
Such as, the new nounce values and

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:14.030
the new pubic components of
the [INAUDIBLE] key change.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.790
Therefore, unless the pre-shared key

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.490
which can be considered as the master
share secure key is compromised.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.030
The keys for
the current IPsec SA are secure,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.140
even if other keys previously
computed have been compromised.
