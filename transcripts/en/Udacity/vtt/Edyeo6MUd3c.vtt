00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.260
So finally, let's look at a little bit
more detail about these types of codes.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.292
So this was our all open shutter,
the sinc function looked like this.

00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:11.083
I captured both low and
high frequencies.

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:15.129
Of course, we can just alternate the
shutter, not in a random matter at all,

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.730
but just much more in
a time manner like this.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.980
A sinc function also still has low
frequencies and high frequencies,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.860
it just has a different our, you know,
representation doesn't help us much.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.252
Random, we can just run it randomly.

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:30.867
It can, that would allow us to do this,
but again, would have more variations,

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:33.690
would have more peaks and
lows and stuff like that.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.310
What these authors found is some sort
of a flutter starter signal like this,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.020
which went through small, sharp, small,
large, small, large kinds of things.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.324
Gave a sinc function like this that
captured all of the high frequencies,

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:48.456
and that was much more amenable to
the kind of stuff they wanted to do.

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:50.490
Again, the analysis of this
exists in the paper, and

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.410
I encourage you to look at it.
