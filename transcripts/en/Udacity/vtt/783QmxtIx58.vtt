If we reload the page,

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.939
we can see here that we have a list of buttons with an orange background

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.110
containing all the years of the World Cup, starting with 1930 and going to 2014.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.750
Now this looks great, but I still want to be able to animate through

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.908
all the years before a user will select and possibly interrupt the animation.

00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:29.710
To do this, I need to make sure that the animation finishes before I append

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.260
these elements, and before I start adding some interaction to these buttons.
