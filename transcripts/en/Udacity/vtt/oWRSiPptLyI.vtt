00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.035
The shorter leg is 12, the longer leg is 16, and the hypotenuse is 20. Great

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:10.047
problem solving if you found those numbers. Our setup will be very similar to

00:00:10.047 --> 00:00:13.282
the problems before. We'll have the hypotenuse of 4x, and legs of 3x plus 1,

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:22.054
and 2x plus 2. We square the first leg to get 9x squared, plus 6x plus 1. We

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:26.158
square the second leg to get 4x squared plus 8x plus 4 and we square the

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:31.783
hypotenuse to get 16x squared. Next we'll combine the like terms of x squared,

00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:36.795
the like terms for x and the constant terms to get this left hand expression.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:42.504
13x squared plus 14x plus 5. Now we want to move all of these terms to the

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:47.424
right hand side of the equation by subtracting them. We subtract each of these,

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:50.787
so that way we can get an x squared term that's positive and we can get 0 on

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:56.975
the left hand side. Next we'll use factoring by grouping, to get the factors of

00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:03.314
3x plus 1, times x minus 5. We set this factor equal to 0. And we set this

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:08.727
factor equal to 0. Solving for x, we'll have x can equal negative one third, or

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:13.910
x can equal positive 5. Now, we won't let x equal negative one third since this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.880
side length will end up being negative four thirds. That wouldn't make sense.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.180
Instead, we'll let x equal 5, and we'll substitute it in for each of these

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.769
expressions. This is how we get the shortest leg to be 12, the longer leg to be

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:31.191
16, and the hypoteneuse to be 20.
