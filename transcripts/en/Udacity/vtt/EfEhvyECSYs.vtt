00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.235
In working out the answer to the last
quiz, we saw that when you're multiplying

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:08.563
2 polynomials together, we actually end
up using the distributive property a

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:13.059
couple of times, multiplying every term
in the first expression by every term in

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:17.278
the second expression. So we're taking
every possible combination of pairs of

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.480
terms, using one from the first expression
and one from the second expression. This

00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:25.435
is actually a general rule that applies to
multiplying any pair of polynomials,

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:30.257
regardless of long it is. So we could use
this trick even if there were 10 terms

00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:33.160
inside the first set of parentheses and 3
terms inside the second set of

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:37.380
parentheses, or any other number of terms
in either one. In any situation like this

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:41.779
we just need to go through one by one,
each of the terms inside the first set of

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:47.213
parentheses, and multiply them by the
terms over here. So in this case, we start

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:52.074
with x, and we say x times the first term
over here, which is x, so we have x times x.

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:56.112
And the second thing we do is multiply
x by the next term in the second set of

00:00:56.112 --> 00:01:00.660
parentheses, x times -2. Then, since we've
exhausted all the terms inside the second

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.010
set of parentheses, we can move to the
next factor inside the first set of

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.377
parentheses, which is 5. 5 applies to the
first term in the second set of

00:01:08.377 --> 00:01:13.619
parentheses, which is x, and then also to
the second term, which is -2. So stepping

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.764
one by one, through the terms inside the
first set of parentheses, and applying

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:22.093
them each to all of the terms inside the
second parentheses, before moving on to

00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:26.035
the next term, in the first set of
parentheses, is a great way to make sure

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:29.799
that you have actually covered all of your
bases, and made all of the combinations of

00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:31.643
pairs or terms that you can.
