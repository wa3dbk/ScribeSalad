00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.770
We've just shown how to position and orient a camera in world space. If we

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.920
apply this matrix C to some camera object, the camera then gets placed in the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.671
world. However, we want exactly the opposite of this. We don't want to position

00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:14.090
the camera with respect to the world, we want to position the world with

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.120
respect to the camera. Think about what's happening. We have some objects in a

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.862
scene, they've perhaps had a number of modeling transforms applied to them. The

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:25.414
objects are now all positioned in world space. What we want to do now is

00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:29.250
transform the world to the camera's frame of reference. Here's a camera and a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.431
model. Say we slide the camera five units along the world's x axis. From the

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:36.097
camera's point of view, if we subtracted 5 from all the world coordinates,

00:00:36.097 --> 00:00:40.136
everything would be nicely oriented for the camera. The long and short here is

00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:42.332
that we use the inverse of the matrix that would position the camera in the

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:47.418
world. Inverting basically says, no. It's all about me, the camera. Reorient

00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:51.784
everything with respect to me, me, me. This inverse matrix is called the view

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.602
matrix. For this reason, this view matrix is sometimes written as the inverse

00:00:55.602 --> 00:00:59.155
of the camera matrix. The matrix that would move the camera to its place in

00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:02.762
world space. Another way to think of this view transform is simply as the very

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:06.766
last modelling matrix in the chain. The M matrix represents all the transforms

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:11.160
needed to get the object into world space. Modelling transforms. Now one last

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.121
transform, the view matrix V takes the objects in world space and moves them

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:18.720
into camera's frame of reference. If you deal with WebGL or OpenGL directly,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.100
you'll see these two matrices put together as a single matrix called the model

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.451
view matrix. This matrix is applied to an object, immediately taking it from

00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:28.650
its own model space to view space.
