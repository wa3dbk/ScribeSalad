00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.100
So what exactly is Core Data?

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.990
Core data is essentially
a framework to help you manage

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.080
the model part of your app.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.480
You recall that the model view
controller design patterns splits

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.440
your app up into three parts.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.260
And that the model part is what
deals with the important tangible

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.080
essential pieces of the app.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.160
Core data gives us a way to
manage these important pieces and

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.420
gives them the title managed objects.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.590
What does managing these objects entail?

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.940
It includes everything from changing
them, tracking them, persisting them,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.119
to managing their relationships and
more.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.770
Let's look at an overview of the core
data architecture to see how this works.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.920
There are several main components
to become familiar with, and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.970
we've already somewhat
touched on two of them.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.260
The managed object model,
also referred to as the data model,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.000
is basically the physical representation
of the model we just spoke of.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.470
It exists in XCode as a special
kind of graphic file,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.560
similar to a storyboard file, but
with different purpose and capabilities.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.370
The managed object model is what is used
to specify the classes and relationships

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.850
that will be managed within your app and
is therefore also what the tables and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.400
rows of your app's SQL-like
database will be generated from.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.340
Much like how interface builder
automates a storyboard file,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.900
core data automates
a managed object model file.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.270
Managed objects are those important
fundamental pieces we spoke of earlier.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.070
A character in a game app and
event in a calendar app.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.130
There would specified by
your object model and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.540
what are actually responsible for
most of core data's magic,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.620
see while they look like regular swift
objects they have a substantial twist.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.740
Unlike any object we've seen thus far,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.910
they save the contents of their
properties to a database file.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.190
Core data actually hides
this complexity from us, so

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.110
we don't have to worry about it,
which is why we refer to it as magic.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.510
Every single object of your model will
be a subclass of NSManagedObject.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.060
The managed object context or

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.980
the context is where most
of the action happens.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.670
This object,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.210
an instance of NSManagedObjectContext
is helpful to imagine as a place.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.820
The context is where your managed
objects live until they're saved to disk

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.650
and when nearly every core
data operation takes place.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.180
Want to create an object you need
a context in which it will live.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.670
Want to delete an object?

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.870
Ask the context.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.700
Want to save?

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.460
Again ask the context.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.250
To find out who and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.580
what is living inside the context,
a fetch request is needed.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.610
A fetch request is a search
of the context for

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.940
a certain type of managed object.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.050
It can specify the type of
managed object, a filter, and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.330
how the resulting objects
should be sorted.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.920
All of the pieces of core today
that we've discussed thus far,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.000
have belonged to the model layer.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.720
This next piece, the fetch results
controller works in part to control how

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.690
the data from the fetch requests
will be displayed in the view and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.000
is thus part of the controller layer.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.410
A fetch results controller takes
fetch request runs the search and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.300
helps display the results
in a table view, or

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.340
with a little extra work on
our part a collection view.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.610
The most basic task a controller must
perform is to keep the model and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.120
view in sync.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.270
An NS Fetch results controller
does precisely this.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.110
If the objects returned by
the fetch request ever change,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.130
the fetch results controller
automatically updates the table view.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.710
At the lower level, Core Data relies
on what's called persistent stores, or

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.290
stores for short.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.920
Stores like the name implies
are were managed objects

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.720
actually get stored when saved to disk.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.860
They can be thought of as
database data files and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.850
can exist in several types namely XML,
binary format and SQLite.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.970
The latter being the most common and
also the one will be using.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.690
Note that you can have more than one
store or type of store in a given app.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.220
Also at the lower level is the last
piece we're going to talk about for now.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.470
The persistent Store Coordinator.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.990
This object allows you to
have multiple stores and

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.980
keep the rest of your
app from knowing it.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.850
But for the most part,
persistence stores and

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.740
their coordinators are not something
you have to worry about too much.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.310
These classes when put together make
up what's called the Core Data Stack.
