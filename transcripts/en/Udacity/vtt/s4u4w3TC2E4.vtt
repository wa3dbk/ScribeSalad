00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.010
Okay, for the first one I'm at five, positive five. So, one, two, three, four,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.469
five. I know that I'm five units away from zero, so I get five. Negative eight

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:14.790
is right here. I know it's eight units away from zero. So this answer is

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:21.163
positive eight. Remember the distance or the absolute value is always positive.

00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:26.891
Here's negative five. And just like the first one, that's also five units from

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:31.940
zero, so again five. For 5 plus 2, I'm going to move five units to the right. So

00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:36.715
I'd be right here at five, and then I'm going to go two more to the right.

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.584
because I have 5 plus 2. So I end up at seven. Whenever you have expressions

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:46.966
inside absolute value you want to simplify them first. Just like parenthesis and

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:52.030
brackets. I would have 5 plus 2 which is 7. The absolute value of 7 is 7. For 2

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:57.191
minus 5 I'm going to start by going positive 2. Notice that when the sign isn't

00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:03.170
present it's always positive. So positive two. Then I have to move five units to

00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:09.345
the left. One, two, three, four, five. I end up at negative three. I know 2

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:15.370
minus 5 is negative 3. So I have the absolute value of negative three. I'm

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:21.365
trying to find the distance of negative 3 from 0. And I know that's just three

00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:23.695
units. All right, nice job on that quiz.
