00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.902
Negative 1 and 3 halves, or 1 and a half, is correct. Excellent algebra skills

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:08.389
for getting that one right. When we look at the quadratic equation, we want to

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.514
look for our greatest common factor first. Each term shows a factor of 5. So I

00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:17.545
can factor that out. We can factor the 5 out, leaving us with 2a squared, minus

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:21.937
a, minus 3. Remember to keep writing this as an equation. All of these factors

00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:27.000
multiplied together equal 0. Next I want to find factors of negative 6 that sum

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.628
to negative 1. I can use negative 3 and positive 2. We remove an a from the

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:35.581
first group of terms and a positive 1 from the second group of terms. There's no

00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:39.747
other greatest common factor for these two terms except 1. I notice that I have

00:00:39.747 --> 00:00:44.737
2a minus 3 for both of the parenthesis. This let's me do factoring by grouping.

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:49.601
We factor 2a minus 3 from this first term and the second term to leave us with a

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:54.130
product of factors. Next we set each factor equal to 0, and then we solve for

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.356
the values of a. We know 5 doesn't equal 0, so this is not a solution. A could

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:05.233
equal negative 1, or a could equal 3 halves. And this would be our solution set.
