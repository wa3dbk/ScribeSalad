00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's do a little bonus question here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And this is, again, a rather challenging one, but I think you can figure it out.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So exponential time, as you know, is time of O(2)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to the power of some polynomial of n, so we'll just write this as p(n).

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And, of course, p is some polynomial of n,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and this here is also a polynomial of n,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and this is O(2^p(n)).

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.500
My question for you is, given that we can simulate nondeterministic polynomial time

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.000
and deterministic exponential time, does that imply that these two classes here--

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
EXPTIME and NEXPTIME--are actually the same?
