00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.880
If we set this expression equal to 0, I can't really think of a way to factor

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.418
it. So, our best way is to use the quadratic formula. All we need to do is plug

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:10.538
the proper coefficients into the proper places in the formula, and then

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:14.455
simplify. And it looks that we're going to get an answer that has an imaginary

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:18.422
part since we're taking this square root of a negative number. We end up with 3

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:23.400
plus or minus 2i which, then of course, we can split into two separate answers.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.519
With 3 plus 2i and 3 minus 2i.
