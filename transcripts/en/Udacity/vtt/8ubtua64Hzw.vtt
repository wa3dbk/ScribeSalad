00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.892
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well for A, we travel four units to the left and then tjjeree units down, so

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:10.566
negative 4, negative 3. For B, we don't move horizontally, we just move down 3,

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:15.724
so 0, negative 3. For C, we move to the right 3 units and down 3 units, so

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:21.304
positive 3 for the right, negative 3 for down. And finally for D, 5 units right,

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:25.713
3 units down. If you got all of these right, then you really have a strong

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:27.359
understanding of points.
