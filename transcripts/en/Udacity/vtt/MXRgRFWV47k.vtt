00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.520
Here's our factored answer. Great work if you got that one correct. To divide a

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.405
rational expression, we multiply by the recripricol. So, we change division to

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:14.140
multiplication and flip the second fraction over. We can use factoring patterns

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.039
to find the factors of this numerator and. And denominator. This is a difference

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.852
of squares. So we have x plus 3 times x minus 3. Our denominator, however, is a

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:27.842
perfect square trinomial. So we'll have x minus 3 times x minus 3. We find

00:00:27.842 --> 00:00:33.393
factors of negative 6 that sum to negative 5. Those factors are negative 6 and

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:38.496
positive 1. We use factoring by grouping to get 2x plus 1 times x minus 3. For

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:43.714
our denominator, we want to find factors of negative 36. That sum to negative 5.

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:49.524
Those factors are negative 9 and positive 4. After factoring, we get 3x plus 2,

00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:54.068
times, 2x minus 3. Now we're ready to simplify our factors. This x minus 3

00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:59.052
divided by x minus 3 equals 1. And look at that, there's another x minus 3,

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:04.680
divided by x minus Is 3. Those will also equal 1. And our remaining factors are

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.320
x plus 3 and 2x plus 1 for the numerator, and 3x plus 2 times 2x minus 3 in our

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.473
denominator.
