HTML stands for the "hypertext markup language."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Many of you may have some previous experience with HTML,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but that's not necessary.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
HTML as w know it was invented to Tim Berners-Lee,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a British computer scientist working in Switzerland around 1990.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For our purposes, HTML just tells a web browser how to display a webpage.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In fact, HTML is not all that different from using symbols like stars or underscores

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to emphasis text that you're writing to someone else.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In HTML this emphasized plain text becomes "I,"

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then this special punctuation that means let's do some bold now, "really,"

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
this special punctuation that means I'm done with bold, let's go back to normal,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and then "like you." The "b" stands for "bold."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's go see how that pans out.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Here in this particular window, I'm showing the raw HTML source on the left

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and how it might look in a web browser on the right.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Here when I've added the bold tags around really, we see "I really like you."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The "really" is rendered in bold.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Other comment approaches in HTML for emphasis are the use of underlines, the "u,"

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and italics, "i." Each one of these is called a "tag."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This special syntax with the "b" in angle brackets and the "b" sort of similar angle brackets,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the "u," the closing "u," the "i," the closing "i,"

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is a tag that's associated with that word, or that span of text,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and tells the web browser how to render it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This part here, the left angle bracket and the right angle bracket--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that's a starting tag, and this other part--the left angle bracket followed by a slash,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the slash is super important, begin an end tag.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That's a little complicated to say.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Mark the start of an ending tag and tell you that the current tag is about to stop.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here's a beginning bold tag. Here's an ending bold tag.

00:01:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You can see that play out on the right. Only the word "really" is bolded.
