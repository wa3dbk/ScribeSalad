00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.160
So now that we understand how to
address the variety of screen sizes and

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.600
densities out there,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.590
we can get into how we go about
constructing your user interface.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.740
As you remember from
Android Fundamentals,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.750
your UI is a nested tree that
we call the view hierarchy.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.960
Now, this tree defines the entire
structure of the UI from the root view

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.890
group all the way down to the leaf
views, such as text, buttons, or images.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.660
Now, every single thing you
see on the screen in your app

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.370
is a view somewhere in this hierarchy.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.070
You can define your UI either by
creating these objects in code, or

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.720
by declaring your layout in an XML file.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.130
Now we very much prefer
the latter approach,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.430
as it allows you to separate the
presentation from the app's behavior.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.470
Each element in your UI will have a
number of parameters associated with it.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.500
Some are common and must be provided for
all views, such as its width, height, or

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.090
location on the screen.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.040
Other parameters are specific to
a particular view, such as a button will

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.910
have parameters for its background and
the text to display.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.110
Let's dive in and see how the elements
are sized and placed on the screen.
