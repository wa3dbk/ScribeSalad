00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, we finally got into my favorite testing topic, which is random testing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And random testing just means that test cases are created at least in part

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
using input from a random number generator.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This became my favorite testing method a few years ago, when I noticed though without even

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
realizing it, I've written a random tester for every piece of software I ever wrote

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
where I actually cared about its correctness.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, I've written at least a dozen random testers.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, let's look at how this works. We have a random case generator.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The test case generator takes its input pseudorandom numbers,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so PRNG here stands for pseudorandom number generator.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Of course, on computers, we almost never get real random number generators.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What we rather get are pseudorandom numbers which are algorithmically generated

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but for purposes of creating test cases, they're good enough.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The nice thing about pseudorandom numbers is they're repeatable.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, when we start using a pseudorandom number generator, we give it a seed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which completely determines the sequence of random numbers it's going to generate.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So, if we ever want to generate the same random numbers, all we have to do is remember the seed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is actually nice because we don't have to save of voluminous random tests.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We can rather just remember what seed we started with

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
if we ever wanted to get back a particular set of random tests.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The other thing that goes into a random test case generator,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
usually to make a good one, you needed a significant amount of domain knowledge.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
By domain knowledge, I just mean that you have to understand

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
some properties of the software under test.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're talking about quite a bit of detail about what form this domain knowledge might take

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and how you encode this as part of the random test case generator.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Generated test cases come out of the random case generator

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and they go into the software under test.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The software under test executes and produces some output.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The output is inspected by a test oracle.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The oracle, as we've already learned, makes a determination

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
whether the output of the software under test is either good or bad.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If the output is good--that is to say, if it passes whatever checks we have,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we just go back and do it again.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
On the other hand, if it the output is not okay, we save the test case somewhere for later inspection

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and we go back and do more random testing.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And so, the key to making this all work is, wrap the entire random testing tool chain

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and some sort of a driver script which runs it automatically.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What we do is we start the random tester on some otherwise unused machine

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and we go and do other things or we go home.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And while we're doing other things, the random testing loop executes

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
hundreds, thousands, or millions of times.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The next time we feel like seeing what's going on, maybe coming to work in the morning

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and we basically just see what kind of test cases have been saved.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If anything interesting turned out, we have some followup work to do,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
like creating reportable test case and debugging.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If nothing interesting happened, then that's good.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We didn't introduce any new bugs and we can rebuild

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the latest version of a software under test and start the testing loop again.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Generally, the way random testing works is, is not necessarily part of the test suite

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
for the software under test, but rather it's a separate testing loop that gets run independently,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
acts to the separate or an external quality assurance mechanism.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If the random test generator is well done, and if we give us a sufficient amount of CPU resources

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to the testing loop, and if it's not finding any problems, random testing can significantly increase

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
our confidence that the software under test is working as intended.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And it turns out that in general, there are only a couple of things that are hard about making this work.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
First of all, it can be tricky to come up with a good random test case generator,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and second, they can be tricky to come up with good oracle.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And of course, we've already said that these are the hard things about testing in general,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
making test cases, and determining if outputs are correct.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Basically, the same thing is the case here, but the character of the problems that we run into

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
while doing random testing are a little bit different and that's where we're going to spend

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the next several units of this course looking at.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
What I'd like to do now is go over a couple of real examples.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
One of them involves a very large random tester testing quite complicated pieces of software.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The other one is almost trivial, it's a tiny almost one line random tester.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This testing a small function, by the way, so let's take a look at this.
