00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
The answer here is that if you have n copies of this structure here in a row like this

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.150
then there are 2^n different shortest paths from A to B that visit all vertices.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.240
And the reason why that is is that each time you encounter this structure here

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.080
there is the two possibilities that we talked about.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.980
You can either go this way up here or you can either go this way down here

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.610
and then you have to continue this way until you get to one of these edges here

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.150
and then you can redecide if you want to go up or you want to go down.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.100
There's two possibilities for the first one, two possibilities for the second one,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.840
and so on and so on and so on, and two possibilities for the last one.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.130
Two multiplied by itself n times is 2^n.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.240
And this actually doesn't look too bad, does it?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.110
Because each of these gadgets, if you will, that I've drawn here could now represent

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.480
a variable in a Boolean formula and each shortest path between A and B

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.600
is kind of a true-false assignment to those variables.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.140
We could say for example that whenever we choose our path from A to B to go up here

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.650
and then like this, this structure here or this way to do the path.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.860
Now that represents setting the variable to true so this here which represents x₁ for example

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.910
so then going this way would mean x₁ is true.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.400
Going the other way, so down, would represent false.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.120
This would be a way to represent assignments of true and false

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.460
to the variables x₁, x₂, and so on through xn.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.710
Now of course choosing the path between A and B is still totally arbitrary.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.510
What we are missing is the clauses of the Boolean formula.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.580
And again it takes a bit of playing around to find out how we can represent

00:01:39.580 --> 99:59:59.000
clauses here in this picture.
