00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.440
All three of these are accurate. After a year or two of under stimulation, a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.340
toddler's brain is both smaller and less active than a typical toddler who was

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.390
stimulated. Underdeveloped neural growth translates to cognitive and

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.476
intellectual deficit, such as lower IQ. This can be seen even when all

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:23.720
nutritional needs are met, but the social or physical simulation is lacking.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.848
You'll see children who are severely delayed in development. In one interesting

00:00:27.848 --> 00:00:31.565
case, a girl has adopted grew eight inches in about a year as compared to

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:37.206
normal two inches, given that human in social creatures. This shows how we not

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:39.400
only need food but we need each other
