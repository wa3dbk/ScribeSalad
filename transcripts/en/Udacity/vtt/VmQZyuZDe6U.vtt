00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.890
In this lesson, we will look at

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.330
how data center tarffic engineering through customized

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.150
topologies and special mechanisms for load balance

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.590
can help reduce linkulization, reduce the number of

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.590
hops to each the edge of the data center, and make the data center network

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.500
easier to maintain. We saw in the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.530
last lesson how existing data center topologies provide

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.100
extremely limited server to server capacity

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.409
because of the over subscription of the

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.250
links at the top of the hierarchy.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.280
Additionally, as services continue to be migrated

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.510
to different parts of the data

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.920
center resources can be fragmented, significantly lowering

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.540
utilization. For example, if the service denoted

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.610
by green is running mostly in one

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.220
part of the data center, but there's a

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.170
little bit running on a virtual machine in

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.270
another part of the data center, this might

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.730
cause traffic to traverse. Links of the data

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.570
center topology hierarchy, thus significantly lowering utilization and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.900
cost efficiency, reducing this kind of fragmentation can

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.420
result in complicated layer two, or layer three,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.890
routing reconfiguration, what we'd like to have is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.540
just the abstraction is of one large layer to switch, this is the abstraction

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.005
that VL2 provides. So, VL2 has two main objectives. One is to achieve

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.860
layer-two semantics across the entire data center

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.170
topology. This is done with a name-location

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.950
separation and a resolution service that resembles

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.190
the fabric manager which we talked about

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.320
in the last lesson. In which is described in more detail in the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.770
paper. To achieve uniform high capacity

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.410
between the servers and balance load across

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.590
links in topology, VL2 relies on

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.760
flow based random traffic interaction using valiant

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.890
load balancing. Let's take a closer look at how that load balancing works.
