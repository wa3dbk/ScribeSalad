Like we've done before, let's figure out some points to plot, so we can

eventually graph this equation. Since we can fit a lot of glasses wipers in a

00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:10.920
suitcase, we're going to count them up by tens. I'd like you to find the

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:14.804
corresponding weight of this suitcase or y value for each x value. I already

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:17.908
done one of them for you just to make your life a little bit easier.
