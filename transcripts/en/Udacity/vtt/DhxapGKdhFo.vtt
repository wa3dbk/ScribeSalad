00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.789
We've already seen that square roots can be expressed equivalently with either

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.983
radical signs or with exponents of one half, but as a matter of fact, all

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:13.202
exponent of 1 over n, where n is a natural number, can be expressed with a

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:17.784
radical sign But we need to differentiate between this radical sign and this

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:22.279
radical sign, or all the different radical signs we would use as this number n

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:26.786
changes. To do this we put a little number next to the radical sign. To denote x

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:32.070
to the 1/3 or the cube root of x, for example, you put a little 3 by the radical

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.896
sign.

00:00:32.902 --> 00:00:37.470
The question I have for you is, if we want to express the nth root of x, what

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:39.889
symbol belongs next to the radical sign?
