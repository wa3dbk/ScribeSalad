00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.010
Obviously there are many possible tests that we can use to

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.910
reach 100% branch and condition coverage. So I'm just going to show a

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.740
possible one, which is x equal to 3 and y is

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.410
equal to negative 2. If we specify this as case, you can

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.900
see that the overall condition is false, because neither x is

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.990
equal to 0 nor y is greater than 0. Therefore we will

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.420
follow the false, false branch, and achieve 100% branch and condition coverage

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.400
for this code. And we might require to be even more thorough,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.690
that all the combinations of our conditions inside each

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.790
decision, inside each predicate, are tested. Which is what is

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.010
called, multiple condition coverage. But because of the way

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.050
this criterion is defined, it is combinatorial, becuse you have

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.220
to consider all the possible combinations of conditions. And

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.210
therefore it's extremely expensive, to the point of being impractical.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.610
So instead of defining that criterion, we're going to find

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
another one which finds a good trade off between thoroughness

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.815
of the tests and their cost.
