Here's a question to get you going with Vector math. In world space coordinates,

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:10.539
given p is a point negative 7, negative 4, 14. E is a vector negative 4, 19, 18.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:18.038
And s is a vector negative 5, 6, negative 10. What's q? Where q is defined as p

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.053
plus e minus s.
