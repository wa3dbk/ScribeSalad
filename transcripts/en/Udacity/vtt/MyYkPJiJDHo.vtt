00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.220
Now that we have seen partial art of planning in action, let us try to

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.080
do a series of exercises to make sure that we understand it clearly.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.540
We have come across this problem earlier. This is the micro world of blocks.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.190
Here is the initial state. And here is the goal state. We need to transfer from

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.730
this initial state to the goal state, moving only one block at a time.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.680
Please write on the initial state and the goal state in propositional logic.
