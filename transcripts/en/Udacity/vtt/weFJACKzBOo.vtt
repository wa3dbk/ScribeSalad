00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.812
Now I would like you to figure out what you need to do to either side of the

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:07.708
equation to make it so that what we end up with next has all the terms of x on

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.717
the left side of the equation, and no more terms with x on the right side. You

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:15.790
can still have constant terms on the left side, and if you want to combine like

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.731
terms in places where that's possible, you're totally open to that. But, you

00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:20.433
don't have to.
