00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.130
The first chart I will try is a bar chart.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.569
To do this with Dimple there are a few steps to go through, but

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.170
many less than doing this with D3 itself, which we will see later in the lesson.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.771
I want to talk through my coding the editor, before we move back to

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:19.350
the browser and interactively explore what each of these lines does.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.710
The conventions that Dimple works with are axis, series and fields,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.190
which I'll call them here to not confuse them with JavaScript variable, though

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.810
they are more closely related to what the grammar of graphics calls variables.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.350
And fields simply refer to columns in our dataset.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.660
Here, attendance is the attendance column.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.770
These three features are the essential building blocks of any chart and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.580
by manipulating each of these we can create a wealth of diverse charts.
