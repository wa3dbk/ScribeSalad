00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:02.029
&gt;&gt; And so now let's give the explanation for the quiz.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt; Alright, so, let's see what happened here. So,

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.960
what you're saying is in some cases the inputs are

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.760
discrete or continuous or complicated. In other cases the outputs

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.290
could be discrete or continuous or complicated. But I think

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.046
what you were saying is, that what on, on,

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:19.100
what matters to determine if something is classification or regression

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.620
is whether the output is from a discrete small set

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.540
or, or whether it's some continuous quantity. Is that right?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.534
&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly right. The difference between

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:29.820
a classification task or a regression task is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.080
not about the input, it's about the output.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.380
If the output is continuous then it's regression

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.242
and if the output is small discrete set

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:41.990
or discrete set, then it is a classification

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.470
task. So, with that in mind, what do you think is the answer to the first one?

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.540
&gt;&gt; So, lend money. If it was something like predicting

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.130
a credit score, that seems like a more continuous quantity.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.850
But this is just a yes no, so that's

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.500
a discrete class, so I'm going to go with classification.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.650
&gt;&gt; That is, correct. It is classification and the short answer is, because

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.060
it's a binary task. True, false. Yes, no. Lend money or don't lend money.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.900
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.980
&gt;&gt; So it's a simple classification test. Okay,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.460
with that in mind, what about number two?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.810
&gt;&gt; Alright, so number two. It's trying to judge

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.320
something about where they fall on a scale, high school,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.120
college, or grad student. But all of, the system is being asked to do is put

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.400
them into one of those three categories, and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.810
these categories are like classes, so it's classification.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.290
&gt;&gt; That is also exactly right. Classification. We moved from binary

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.655
to trinary in this case, but the important thing is that it's

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:37.480
discrete. So it doesn't matter if it's high school, college grad,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.366
professor, elementary school, any number of other ways we might decide where

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:44.092
your status of matriculation is is a small discrete

00:01:44.092 --> 00:01:47.305
set. So, with that in mind, what about number three?

00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:50.600
&gt;&gt; Alright, so the input is the same in this case. And the output is kind of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.280
the same except there's, well there's certainly more

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.680
categories because there's more possible ages than just those

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920
three. But when you gave the example you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.980
did explicitly say that ages can be fractional like,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.130
you know, 22.3. So that definitely makes me

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.540
think that it's continuous, so it should be regression.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.980
&gt;&gt; Right, I think that is exactly the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.650
right thing, you have a continuous output. Now,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.200
I do want to point something out. That

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.260
while the right answer is regression, a lot of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.690
people might have decided that the answer was

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.010
classification. So, what's an argument? If I told

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.690
you in fact the answer was classification, what

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.000
would be your argument for why that would be?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.530
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.100
&gt;&gt; Can you think of one?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess. I mean, you know,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.320
if you think about ages as being discrete. You

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.570
just say, you know, you can one or two or three or, you know, whatever up to

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.010
130, say. But there, but there's just that, that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.060
set. There isn't really, you know, usually we don't talk

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.655
about fractional ages. So, so it seems like you could

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:40.780
think of it as, as, as a set of classes.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.663
&gt;&gt; Right. So let's imagine. So, how

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.794
old are people? Let's imagine we only cared

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:48.246
about years, so you're either one or two or three or four or five. Or maybe

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:51.088
you can be one and a half, and two and a half, and three and a

00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:53.590
half. But, whatever, it's, it's not all possible

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.750
real number values. And we know that people

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.350
don't live beyond, say, 250. Well, in that case, you've got a very large

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.110
discrete set but it's still discrete. Doesn't matter whether there's two things

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.370
in your set, three things in your set, or in this case 250 things in

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.670
your set, it's still discrete. So, whether it's regression, or classification,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.520
depends upon exactly how you define your output and these things

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.470
become important. I'm going to argue that in practice, if you were

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.170
going to set up this problem, the easiest way to do it

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.700
would be to think about it as a real number and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.890
you would predict something like 23.7. And so it's going to end

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.110
up being a regression task and we can might, maybe think

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.870
about that a little bit more as we move along. So

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.760
either answer would be acceptable depending

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.900
upon what your explanation of exactly

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.360
what the output was. Was. You buy that?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.930
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.718
&gt;&gt; Excellent. Okay. Alright, let's move beyond the

00:03:54.718 --> 00:03:56.846
quiz and start thinking about exactly what it

00:03:56.846 --> 00:03:59.420
means to define a classification problem. And then

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.360
later what it means to define a regression problem.
