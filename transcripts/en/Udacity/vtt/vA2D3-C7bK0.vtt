00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.640
&gt;From this notion of a cut,

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.180
it's natural to think about how much
flow could possibly come across?

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.370
Well clearly it can't exceed the sum
of the capacity of the crossing edges.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.465
This intuition gives rise to
the idea of the capacity of the cut.

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:16.285
Which is, as I've said,

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:20.155
just the sum of the capacities of
edges crossing over from A to B.

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:25.799
In this case of this graph it's
just 2 + 8 which is equal to 10.
