00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.164
Now, as with any fractions, we have a common factor in the numerator and the

00:00:03.164 --> 00:00:07.987
denominator. We can divide them by that factor and cancel it out. I'd like to

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:11.578
find the greatest common factor shared by the top and bottom of our rational

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:17.088
function here and get rid of it to write the function in simplest terms. Please

00:00:17.088 --> 00:00:20.208
note that I've included our domain restriction over here, so you don't have to

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.279
worry about writing that in.
