00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.593
Another technique that's based on behavioral principals is systematic

00:00:03.593 --> 00:00:09.635
desensitization. This is used in treatment of phobias. This technique pairs the

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:14.575
event that produces the anxiety with a stimulus that elicits an incompatible

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:20.715
response such as relaxation. This is referred to as counterconditioning. For

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:24.590
example, think back to when we introduced Tickles the snake. Snakes are a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.446
common phobia for individuals. And for a person who has a phobia of snakes, if

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:34.640
they saw one, he or she would experience uncomfortable levels of anxiety. With

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.060
systematic desensitization, the therapist would create a hierarchy of stimuli

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.741
snakes. So, for example, they may have a client just imagine looking at a

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:51.070
snake. But while doing so, the therapist teaches the client how to relax. These

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.462
relaxation techniques in turn are then used by the client when exposed to

00:00:55.462 --> 00:01:01.000
stimuli on the hierarchy. This approach relies on reciprocal inhibition which

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.727
is the underlying process of counterconditioning. And it states that certain

00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:10.206
responses are incompatible with each other. So with this, the occurrence of one

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:15.570
response inhibits the other. For example, you can't be relaxed and anxious at

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.938
the same time. Systematic desensitization is a very effective treatment for

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.509
phobias and is widely used.
