00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.145
It turns out that it would only take 15 minutes. Nice algebra skills if you got

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:09.534
that one correct. We know in the first case, we're driving for 20 minutes at 45

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:15.254
miles per hour. So 20 minutes would be time 1, and 45 miles per hour would be

00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:18.891
rate 1. We're looking for how long it takes for the car to travel the same

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:23.970
distance. So this must be x, our time 2. And for the second rate, we're

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.926
traveling at 60 miles per hour, so we fill in this with 60. Then, we cross

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:35.722
multiply to get 900 equals 60x. We divide both sides by 60 to get x is equal to

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:40.210
15, or 15 minutes. The key for these inverse variation problems is that one

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.318
quantity will be in the numerator while the other will be in the denominator. We

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:47.653
usually flip the second fraction to make that happen.
