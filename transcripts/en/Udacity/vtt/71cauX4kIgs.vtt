The easiest way to find documentation is to search for it.

00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:11.575
Looking through the CSS for Bootstrap, we can find documentation around

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:15.170
containers, the grid system, which you'll be using later.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.880
Different media queries that Bootstrap uses to ensure that

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.850
your site looks good on whatever size screen it's opened on.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.960
And it even gives you different options for types of columns.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.600
Let's take a look at these pre-defined classes.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.520
I want you to check out the documentation for the predefined classes.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.380
When you're done, you should be able to answer the following questions, and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.040
apply the correct classes to your HTML.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.640
Which classes should you use to wrap the first row of portfolio items?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.380
The first row would be like this,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.930
following the blue box around appify and sunflower.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.660
And, which class would you use to wrap one featured portfolio item?

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.610
Like simply just Appify.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.980
