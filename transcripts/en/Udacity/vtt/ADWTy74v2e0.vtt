The cube root of x to the 12th would equal x to the 4th. Nice work if you

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.858
figured that one out. We use power divided by root again to get x to the 12

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:15.954
divided by 3. 12 is our power and 3 is our root, or the index. It tells us what

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:20.284
type of root we are taking. This should also make sense as our answer since we

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:26.800
can expand x to the 12th as x to the 4th times x to the 4th times x to the 4th.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.500
x to the 4th appears 3 times underneath our cube root, so that means we can

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.114
pull one of its factors out. So we're left with just x to the 4th.
