HTML markup is made up of things called tags.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.640
Tags look something like this. The way a tag is

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.490
structured is, you've got, a less than symbol, the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.020
tag name, a greater than symbol, the tag contents, which

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.960
can actually be other tags or it could just

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.940
be text, another less than symbol, a slash, the name,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.430
and a greater than symbol. There's two ways that I

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.058
might refer to this. We'd call this the opening tag.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.360
This one, the one with the slash in front of the

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.220
name, we call this the closing tag. The names are always

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.065
the same, and the only difference is the closing tag has

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.780
a slash in front of the name. So you've always got

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.690
name, contents, name. Opening tag, contents, closing tag. Now, I'll also

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.350
refer to this whole thing as an element. And, you know,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.890
this, this isn't something I'm, I'm really going to quiz you on.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.240
I just want you to, you know, understand that when I'm talking

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.850
about HTML I may refer to a tag or I may refer

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.180
to the whole thing as the elements, or sometimes I kind of switch the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.250
words a little bit. But, that's what I'm referring to. I'm just

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.810
referring to, you know, this structure here. Let's learn about our first tag.
