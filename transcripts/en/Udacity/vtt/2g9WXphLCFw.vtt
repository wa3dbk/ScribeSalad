00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.340
When you have a complex project,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.800
it's important to approach it
one small piece at a time.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.870
We don't recommend that you jump
straight into writing meme.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.550
It's easier to experiment
if you create a temporary

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.320
X code project that you
don't plan on keeping.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.490
To learn to pick images, for
example, you might want to create

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.660
a one button app that picks and
displays a single image,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.210
the smallest possible project that will
let you learn what you need to know.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.510
Baby steps to the meme generator.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.383
So here I've made a simple
project to experiment with, and

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:32.427
since the meme editor has a toolbar
at the bottom of the screen,

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:34.568
I'm going to go ahead and
drag one of those in.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.575
And I'll position it and
set its constraints.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:50.183
The tool bar comes with this button,
but I'm going to go head and

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.686
change its label to pick.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.698
And you see I've already got an image
view, so you can go head and

00:00:59.698 --> 00:01:02.687
drag one of those in and
set its constraints.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:05.959
Now I'm going to close this
outline view for a minute and

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:10.771
open up the assistant editor, and then
we can add an outlet for our image view.

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:26.954
Now, let's go down to our button, and
we'll add an action for our button.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.792
Let's call it pickAnImage.

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:37.900
And that ought to do it for Storyboard.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.180
So, we'll focus on our
view controller file.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.388
I'm going to get rid of this
extra method for now, and

00:01:43.388 --> 00:01:47.639
here in the pick and image method
that we just added, we want to launch

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:51.679
out UI image picker controller,
just like we did in lesson two.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.283
So we add these two lines to present
the image picker and let's run it and

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.451
see how it looks.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.622
And there we go.

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:03.250
We can choose from our outlets.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.250
So we're making progress, but

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.788
when I choose a picture, I can't
really tell that it's being chosen.

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:13.510
We still need to implement
the delegate pattern, and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.040
set our view controller as
the delegate of the image picker.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.650
Next step, we'll investigate
the delegate protocol so

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.850
we'll know what method will be called
when the picker has an image chosen.
