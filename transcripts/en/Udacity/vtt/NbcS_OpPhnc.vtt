00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.721
Now, this problem is more challenging. But we'll start it out just the same as

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:09.026
before. We'll change logarithmic form into exponential form. We'll have m as

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:15.194
our base, negative four as the exponent, and 1 16th as the result. So we know m

00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:22.030
to the negative 4 equals 1 16th. Since we're looking for this base m, we want

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.220
this to look like something raised to the negative 4th power. If the powers

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.426
match, then we know what m is. Well, we can rewrite 1 16th as 16 to the

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:38.904
negative 1st power. Remember, a negative exponent makes a reciprocal. So 16 to

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:46.153
the negative 1 equals 1 16th. Now we can rewrite 16 as 2 to the 4th. We'll have

00:00:46.153 --> 00:00:52.340
2 to the 4th, which is 16, raised to the negative 1st power. Now, we can

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.092
simplify this line. We know that when we raise a power to another power, we

00:00:56.092 --> 00:01:01.362
really multiply them together. So, 2 to the 4th raised to the negative 1 equals

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:08.431
2 to the negative 4th. Now, this exponent and this exponent are the same. So,

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:11.392
we know that the bases must also be equal for these numbers to both be equal to

00:01:11.392 --> 00:01:17.736
one another. This is how we get a value for m equal to positive 2. Nice

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:20.350
solving, if you got this correct. I know it was tough.
