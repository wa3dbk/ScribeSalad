00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.770
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know that either this factor, x minus 4, or this factor, x plus 3, have to

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.513
equal 0 in order to make this entire expression equal to 0. That means the

00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:14.262
answers for either one of these equations will satisfy this one. So our two

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:18.959
numbers that x can equal then to satisfy this equation are 4 and negative 3.

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:23.497
Let's look at a graph of this real quick. To help you visualize this a little

00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:27.592
bit better, here's the graph of the parabola corresponding to our original

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:31.897
equation, which you'll recall was y equals x minus 4 times x plus 3. It's really

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:35.927
easy to mistake this equation that we're solving with the equation for the

00:00:35.927 --> 00:00:40.228
parabola. But please remember that this is the equation we get when we plug in a

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:45.518
certain y value. This does not relate x to y, and therefore it can't graph all

00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:50.824
these different points. Looking at the full problem, we can however notice the

00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:54.879
value of what we found. Here's the point, negative 3, 0, one of our

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.702
x-intercepts, which we found right here, and here's the other one, 4, 0. Please

00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:04.117
remember that x-intercepts are actually points, because what we're solving for

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:06.715
here are the x-coordinates of those points.
