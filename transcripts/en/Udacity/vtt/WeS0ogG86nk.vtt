00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.801
So you could have used either the population standard deviation or just the 2.71

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:13.504
for standard error. So our x bar is 40. We have 40 minus 2 times 2.71 as our

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:24.207
lower bound, and then 40 plus... 2 times 2.71 for our upper bound, so that comes

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:31.336
out to 34.58 and 45.42. So we're pretty sure, that if everyone started using the

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:35.704
Beaber Tweeter, then the mean of the population, and the mean of the

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:40.696
corresponding sampling distribution of size 35, Would be between these two

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:47.563
values. So our distribution could be anything from here, centered at 34.58,

00:00:47.563 --> 00:00:54.685
where this value 40 is still within that 95% range. Or to here centered at

00:00:54.685 --> 00:01:04.352
45.02, where our mean is still within that 95% range. This interval from 34.58

00:01:04.352 --> 00:01:11.965
to 45.42 is called the 95% confidence interval for the mean.
