00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.131
Now that we have what equation, we need to set up another one. The other

00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:08.313
equation needs to involve interest. I know if I add the interest from one

00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:12.863
account and the interest from the other account, I'll get my total interest of

00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:17.350
$787.50. But I need to find the interest first. To find the interest, we take

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.108
the rate and multiply it by the amount of money. For example, one of their rates

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:26.363
is 7 point 5 percent. And, the amount of money that I invested at 7 point 5

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:31.156
percent was, well, x. I don't know it. Remember, our equation should involve two

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:35.533
variables, x and y. So, we need to make sure that it appears in the terms. We

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:40.219
convert the percentage rate, 7 point 5 percent, to a decimal, and multiply it by

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.882
x. So, this is the first term. So what are the other terms in the equation. What

00:00:44.882 --> 00:00:48.897
should go here in the second interest. What should go here in the total

00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:51.762
interest. You can write the terms in these boxes.
