00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.490
So let's take a look at a result.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.640
This comes from this nice little
database that was published,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.070
based upon this Pami paper.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.270
Comanici was one of the original
developers of mean shift as applied to

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.260
Computer Vision.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.030
And what you can see here is, so here's
our original image, all right, and

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.300
you apply mean shift, and,
it does a really fine job, all right?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.470
I mean, take a look at
this brick structure here.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.770
And you see all of those pixels
are put in the same region.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.543
Likewise, you get this front
of this building here.

00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:34.043
The whole sidewalk is on one cluster
with the exception of over this area,

00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:34.800
right?

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.080
Well, that's in a dark
shadow from the tree.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.670
You'll notice the whole shadow
has been put into one cluster,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.910
because the system can't,
at this point know that it's a shadow.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.870
All right?

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.510
But I think you would agree that if you
take a look at this picture here, and

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.960
you were to draw boundaries around where
the different clusters were, okay,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.030
you would probably end up with an image
that looked something like that.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.660
Here are some more examples of
a mean shift segmentation result.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.069
And you can see it
does a pretty good job.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.830
You know,
take a look at this picture down here.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.120
All the water is put
into one cluster there.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.808
This foliage is broken out nicely,
the islands, etc.

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:16.920
So if you've got
the right feature space,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.110
it does a pretty good job
of finding the clusters.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.060
Finally, I want to show you an example
that also comes from that same original

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.700
database.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.570
And again, it has a nice, original
image here of a, of the mountain.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.940
And on the right hand side
are the segmentation results.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.190
So, the good news is, you can see
it does a pretty reasonable job.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.730
I mean, it pulls out this section,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.430
all of the section up here that
didn't have the snow on it.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.090
And maybe this, section here as well.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.230
But, notice all the texture
that's going on in here, okay?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.200
Well it's not that that's wrong, it's
just less clear [LAUGH] than it's right.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.800
What I mean by that is, it's not
totally clear what you're trying to do

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.880
with this picture,
that you're carving it up into segments.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.380
That was original idea
behind the super pixels.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.330
The idea was,
let me carve this thing up into

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.460
little atomic units that I know
don't have to be broken up again.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.140
But, whether I recombine them, or
use them together in some way,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.220
depends on upon the future
processing that you have to do.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.740
So often,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.640
what you'll do is a segmentation step to
create these broken up, these regions,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.120
and then figure out how to process
those regions going forward.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.020
So the segmentation then, in some sense,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.540
is a preprocessing step to give you a
much smaller set of units to work with.
