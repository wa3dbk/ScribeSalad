00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.100
For clarity, a file system is
essentially the system by which

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.890
the permanent storage space
of a device is organized and

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.890
divided up to hold files.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.150
The type of file system a machine has
is determined by the operating system

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.710
running on that machine.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.070
For iPhones and iPads this
operating system is called iOS.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.710
And similar to the operating
system running on Macs,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.320
it dictates a UNIX based file system
made up of a hierarchy of directories.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.200
With the primary goals of security and
simplicity in mind, the file system for

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.740
iOS was conceived with
the notion of treating all apps

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.080
as self-contained independent islands.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.845
Each app when it's installed,
is placed in what's called a sandbox, or

00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:40.570
self-contained area of the file system
in which to keep all of its stuff.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.830
You can imagine a new app on your
device as a new student at a school.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.430
Let's call her Appigail.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.680
The new student is given a locker to
keep books, papers, personal items, and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.200
whatever else.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.570
The lockers locked so only this
student has access to her own things.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.380
Likewise, the student doesn't have
access to any fellow student’s lockers.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.150
The only thing is, imagine that
this is a magical school and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.220
that the lockers maintain
magical properties.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.780
There's an overall finite amount of
space that all the walkers combined can

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.320
take up, but until that space limit is
reached, each student's locker will

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.200
expand to fit whatever is put into it or
new lockers can be created.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.980
Whereas if a student has
to store gym bag and

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.000
large textbooks, as long as the overall
locker system has extra space

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.459
this student's personal locker
will expand to fit his items.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500
Likewise, you,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.030
the device's owner, get to decide
how you want the space allocated.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.700
Whether you want to keep 12 gigabytes
of photos, and 6 gigs of music, and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.770
6 gigs of small apps,
the choice is up to you.
