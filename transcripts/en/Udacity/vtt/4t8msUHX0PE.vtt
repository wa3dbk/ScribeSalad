00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.890
In this case, even though coding is involved, the files are not

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.480
really interrelated, so it's fine to track each of the files separately, so

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.100
we don't need to check this one.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.740
In this case the files will be highly interrelated.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.280
The CSS file will define styles that refer to elements in the HTML file, so

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.870
there will likely be changes involved both files.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.820
For example, you might have a single change that both adds an element to

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.020
the HTML file and also adds in a rule to the CSS file to position and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.450
style that element.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.060
For this third one,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.040
it's probably fine to track the files separately since it's unlikely that

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.840
changes to one image will have anything to do with changes to another file.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.940
For this last one you could sort of go either way.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.210
In most cases, changing a single chapter won't have as much effect on the other

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.670
chapters, but if you want to make a big change like changing a character's name,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.490
you probably want to change it across all the chapters all at once so

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.650
checking this would be reasonable too.
