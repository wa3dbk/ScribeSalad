00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.690
The JavaScript console in the Chrome Developer Tools can be

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.160
accessed by clicking on the Console tab, if it's not already open, and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.270
is actually a full featured JavaScript interpreter.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:17.360
We can execute any arbitrary JavaScript, 5 plus 7, and we get returned 12.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.760
Or we can even create functions, and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.780
when executed, gets add to the scope of the console window.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.850
Here, we can see I defined a function named my_fun, and

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.950
when called, simply returns hello world.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.880
So inspecting that in the console.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.025
Notice as I start typing my, the Chrome console knows that

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:44.020
my_fun has been defined and tries to auto-complete it.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.600
Typing tab, I can auto-complete it.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.040
And if I leave the parenthesis off,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.350
what gets returned is simply the definition of that function.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.450
This is a subtlety, but fairly important point.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.290
The definition of a function, in this case, what should get

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.740
run when it's called is separate from actually running that function.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.647
As you can see here,

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:11.100
my_fun without parenthesis, simply returns the definition of that function.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.720
But if I called my_fun with parenthesis,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.508
it signals to call the function and return hello world in this case.

00:01:19.508 --> 00:01:24.448
If your console window is getting too cluttered, you can use a clear function,

00:01:24.448 --> 00:01:30.780
or if you're on a Mac Cmd+K to clear out everything that's been run before.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.270
Also, if you type the up or down arrow keys,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.915
you can scroll through the history of commands which you've run in the console.
