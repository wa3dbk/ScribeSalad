00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.689
For this problem, you can pick any value of x that lies between 1 and 2.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.710
So I'm just going to show you an example of how you could have done this.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.610
I'll pick the value 1.5, since that's right in the middle.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.730
Now if I find the value of the function at x equals 1.5.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.190
I'm actually finding f of 1.5, so I'll write that in here.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.730
And if we plug 1.5 into our function for x, we end up with negative 1.3125.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.080
Now we know that between x equals 1 and x equals 2,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.410
our function goes from being negative to being positive. Since f of 1.5 is

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.390
negative, we know that this is now the new narrower lower bound of our interval.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.140
So instead of the interval going from one to two the new narrow interval,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.191
in which we know that the 0 lies is 1.5 to 2.
