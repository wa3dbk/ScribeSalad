00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.469
We're going to radically
rethink the design of sunshine.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.340
Before we dive into this further,
let me make it clear that

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.130
there are many positive things
about the sunshine design.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.820
Particularly the portrait phone model.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.790
The landscape version, however,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.130
is very clearly a stretched
version of the portrait design.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.040
The giant blue splash for the today view
is a nice idea, but it's a bit too much,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.020
especially in landscape.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.260
The use of roboto condensed, detracts
from the appeal of these reviews.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.740
The detail views even on
a phone start to fall down.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.620
It's a pretty simplistic presentation
with uneven use of white space.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.580
The landscape version even,
needs to scroll to show all content.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.220
For the portrait forecast view,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.048
we're going to moving toward better
use of color and white space.

00:00:43.048 --> 00:00:46.405
Even though we're initially using
up more space with the app bar.

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:49.260
We're going to add some code to
allow us to scroll it along with

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.540
the forecast list.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.585
For the landscape view,

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:55.400
we're doing something pretty radical in
order to improve the use of white space.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.210
Namely we've eliminated
most of the app bar.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.090
By taking the sides of the list in.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.390
We provide more balance to this layout.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.370
It's not ideal but
it's more aesthetically pleasing.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.250
We'll also demonstrate some
parallax scrolling here.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.810
For the detail view we're
doing a more serious overhaul.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.010
We're using a toolbar that matches
the coloring of the detail view.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.570
And only contains share functionality.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.310
The bottom includes a nice accent shade
with a separate section of the app per

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.550
data unique to the detail view.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.840
Overall, it's a far
better use of whitespace.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.530
And a good teaching ground for
some more advanced layout techniques.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.240
The landscape detail view is even more
striking in comparison to the original

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.460
application.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.720
It not only has a nice look.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.750
It actually fits more
information on the screen.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.760
The landscape tablet version
wouldn't make it on google

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.000
play as a tablet optimized application
with all that unused space.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.350
We'll give it a fresh
look with the update.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.480
Our portrait tablet is even more
striking in its comparative use of

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.060
white space.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.740
If the challenge to display an app
which has list like this and tablet's.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.380
Without falling into confusing
user scenarios such as

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.000
changing the number of fragments on
screen between portrait and landscape.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600
We'll dive deeper into implementing
this design throughout the lesson.
