00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Last problem of Unit 3, we find a population faced with a malaria epidemic

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is definitely very scary for everyone involved.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Luckily, we're here to help them out.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In order to slow the spread of the disease,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we're going to make people start using mosquito nets in their houses,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so they can avoid being bitten as often.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to introduce the nets after 100 days and they immediately decrease

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the probability of a person getting bitten by 90%

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
as we can see from the constant that we've defined right here called bite reduction by net.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Bite per day in mosquito tells us that every person gets bitten by each mosquito, 0.1*per day.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now when a mosquito bites a human, there's a chance of two different things

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
happening that are a particular interest to us.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, if a mosquito has malaria, it can give a disease to human or

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
if a human has malaria, then he or she can give it to the mosquito.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The probability of either of these things happening is shown right here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Once infected, it takes a human approximately 70 days to recover.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
At this point, it's important to notice that mosquitoes only live for 10 days.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Clearly, humans also have a finite lifetime but compared to mosquitoes,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
we might as well be immortal even if we do end up with malaria.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Sets that we're going to pretend for the purposes of this problem,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that we can model a scenario like this, we need two separate bubble diagrams--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
one for the mosquito population and one of the human population.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The mosquito life cycle is kind of a sad one--as soon as they are born,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
they fall into the S part of the population, the susceptible part.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
From here, they can become infected and then eventually they die.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There's no option for them to become susceptible again.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
A couple of other things to keep in mind about mosquitoes.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
For one thing, they can't get malaria until after they're born.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Second, only female mosquitoes can transfer malaria.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So just pretend that all the mosquitoes that we're talking about in this problem are female.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Now this problem requires you to take into account

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
all the factors affecting the infected population and to include them using the forward Euler method.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Think critically, keep track of your units, and good luck.

00:01:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
