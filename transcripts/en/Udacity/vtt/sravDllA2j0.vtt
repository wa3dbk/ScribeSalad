Hi I'm with Kaushik who's
a co-founder of Locket.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
And you're actually one of
the co-founders with Yunha,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.370
who I spoke to earlier.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.520
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.431
could you talk to me a little
bit about the design process,

00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:18.190
and how you go about testing with users,
and how do you make sure that you're

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.390
building the right things for
your users?

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.430
&gt;&gt; Well, our product is
mainly a lock screen product.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.820
So we have to be very, very careful what
kind of things we put on lock screen,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.720
what colors we choose, what kind of
things we are actually modifying or

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.470
notifying on the lock screen.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.570
Because this screen is seen by a user
almost 100 to 150 times a day so

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.520
it is very near to the user.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.308
And he has to make sure that
he really likes that screen.

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:46.290
And it's non-intrusive.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.830
So we take care of things like,
very simple design.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.470
We also make sure that he can quickly
access what he wants to access, and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.445
we also keep things like timers and

00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:01.450
weather icons on the lock
screen in right places, so

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.700
he can very naturally go look at that,
instead of actually searching for it.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.370
And the color of the ring on the lock
screen is also very carefully chosen

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.480
because we want to make sure he
does not find it very intrusive or

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.100
taking away his space or
he doesn't like it.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.430
All those things are taken
into consideration.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.160
Fonts and styles are also
taken care of over there, but

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.030
apart from that, because the lock
screen is something which you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.301
look at when you first
go into your phone.

00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:34.410
There are places where you wouldn't want
your neighbors to look at what is on

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.430
your lock screen and all these things.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.030
So taking care of that, as well,
is a very important thing.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.070
All these things put together make

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.000
the design process at Locket a little
more complex than any other place.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.310
But however, we able test all
the features and make sure we

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.640
pick up right things and that's how
the design process goes at Locket.
