00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.300
Associated with every linear program
is a so-called dual program,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.660
which is also a linear program.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.470
This definition is most elegant when
stated in terms of the symmetric form.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.010
Indeed, now you see why this
form gets the name symmetric.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.490
As we saw in the exercise, the dual
program can be thought of as the problem

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.370
of minimizing an upper bound
on the primal program.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.130
Observe that for all feasible y,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.830
we have that b transposed y
is at least y transposed Ax.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.658
Here we've just used this
constraint here from the primal and

00:00:35.658 --> 00:00:39.080
the non-negativity of y from the dual.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.254
And this in turn, is at most cTx,
by the constraints of the dual here,

00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:48.380
and the non-negativity
of x in the primal.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.160
In fact,
we just proved the weak duality lemma,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.120
which states that if x is feasible for
the primal, and y is feasible for

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.190
the dual, then cTx is at most, bTy.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.447
That is to say, that the value of the
primal is at most the value of the dual.

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:09.669
And this makes sense because we built
the dual as essentially an upper bound

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.150
on the primal.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.660
Another thing to note here,
is that if your primal problem

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.600
isn't in this exact form,
you can always convert it and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.020
then look at the corresponding dual and
simplify it.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.510
Often, however, it's easier just to
remember that the dual is the problem of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.450
bounding the primal as
tightly as possible.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.550
For instance, if we change the primal
inequality to an equality, then we can

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.390
proceed by the same argument, only this
first inequality becomes an equality.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.300
And I don't have to rely on
the y being non-negative.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.480
Everything else stays the same.
