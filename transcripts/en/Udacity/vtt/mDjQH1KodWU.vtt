00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.070
When you get a Lego set from the store,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.620
the pieces inside are in
sealed little bags.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.840
Larger sets like this one
have multiple sealed bags.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.060
All of the pieces in one bag create just
a portion, or component, of the model.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.650
After building each of the components,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.760
you can combine them together
to form the completed model.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.110
An Angular module is just
like this cardboard box.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.140
It's a container that houses all of
the different components of an angular

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.390
application.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.070
If the box is like a module,
then this bag might be a controller, and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.950
this little bag could be the router or
a service.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.560
Applications aren't limited
to just one module.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.450
When an application becomes
more complex, it's a good idea

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.880
to break out the different features
of the application into modules.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.580
This keeps your app more organized,
manageable and easier to test.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.700
When we used a Yoman to generate our
app, we gave it the name udaciMeals.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.580
This became the default module for
the app.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.739
The generator creates
the apps model inside appJs.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.840
The module is created by
calling Angular.module,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.170
passing it the name of the module, which
can be anything but automatically uses

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.749
the name provided on the terminal, and
passing it in a ray of dependencies.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.120
Remember that Angular applications
can have more than one module.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.790
If this app depended on other modules,
then those modules are required for

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.240
this app to function.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.960
Those modules names
would be listed here.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.500
So, this tells the angular to
create the udaciMealsApp module and

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.300
that it depends on dep1 and dep2.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.908
This tells Angular to create
the udaciMeals app module,

00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:33.320
and that it doesn't depend
on any other modules.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.247
So this creates the module.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.756
To get the module,
we would write angular.module, and

00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:42.829
give it the name of
the module we want to get.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.330
These two forms are very similar,
but do totally different things.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.940
If you're creating a module,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.260
make sure you pass an array
as the second argument,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
even if the module does not depend on
anything, it needs to have that array.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.138
Also make sure that you create your
module before you try getting it, or

00:01:59.138 --> 00:01:59.971
Angular will complain.
