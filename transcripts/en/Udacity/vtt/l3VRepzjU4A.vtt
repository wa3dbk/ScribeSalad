00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.790
I mentioned earlier that RVM provides opportunities

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.560
for the developer to give hints to

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.070
the library on optimizing the performance of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.498
the library for the chosen application. Or

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.579
in other words, the transaction semantics of

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.423
RVN is already a stripped-down version of

00:00:19.423 --> 00:00:23.480
the traditional transaction semantic. It doesn't what

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.590
you are able nested transaction and so on,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.290
but still transaction by it's very nature requires that

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.750
a commit point, you have to do a synchronous

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.230
to the I/O to the disc. And similarly transaction

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.990
by it's very nature says that, it has an all

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.980
or nothing property. So the transaction is not going

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.650
to commit, that is that it's going to abort, then

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.500
we have to make sure that all the changes

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.720
that have been made between begin transaction and abort transaction

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.880
are thrown away. And similarly, if the transaction

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.570
commits, then we have to make sure that at

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.660
the commit point all of the changes that have

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.990
been made to in memory copies of persistent data

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.300
structures are committed to the disk. That's where

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.770
synchronous I/O comes in. But if the developer wants

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.890
to optimize his performance, RVM gives opportunities for such

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.750
optimizations. The first opportunity is the no_restore mode in

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.090
the begin_xact call. The no_restore mode in begin_xact is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.420
signalling to RVN that this transaction that I am

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.070
starting is not going to abort, and therefore there

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.400
is no need for you to create an in

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.995
memory, undo record for me. Even though I am

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:35.310
going to give you a set range call, don't bother

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.450
creating an undo record for the range of addresses

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.620
that I intend to modify in this beginning transaction.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.970
That's what is meant by the no_restore mode. So

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.850
that reduce the amount of work that the RVM

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.060
has to do in doing a memory copy and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.570
the application is going to gain because RVM is

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.740
doing less work which means the overhead in performing

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.320
a transaction is going to be less as seen

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.505
by the application. The second optimization opportunity is a

00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:06.920
no-flush mode in the end transaction. As I mentioned,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.030
a transaction truly has committed only when

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.460
the changes to the critical section between

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.080
begin transaction and end transaction have been

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.430
synchronously written out to the disk. So, the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.730
normal semantic of an end transaction, that is a commit of a transaction, would

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.970
require that our VM should block the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.910
process that made that call for end transaction,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.980
until that redo record has been written synchronously to the disk.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.560
But if the application developer is opportunistic and believes

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.250
that the chances of failure either due to power

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.040
failure or due to his own software caching is pretty small, he could be brave

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.555
enough to say no-flush mode. And what that no-flush mode is telling the RVM

00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:00.362
library is that there is no need to do a

00:03:00.362 --> 00:03:03.930
synchronous I/O. Of course I want you to write it to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.790
the disk but don't block me in order to write

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.290
to the disk. So no need to do the synchronous flash

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.940
of the redo log to the disk. And, in other

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.400
words, what we're getting by doing a no-flush mode in end

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.370
transaction is lazy persistence. We know it is going to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.840
be persistent on the disk, that is the work that RVM

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.060
is going to do, but it is not doing it

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.770
exactly at the point of end transaction. So the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.950
upshot is, there is a window of vulnerability. End

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.460
transaction happened here, and maybe by the time RVM

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.950
gets to write it out to the disk, so

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.070
much time has elapsed. So this time window is

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.760
the window of vulnerability. So if this axis is

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.950
time, then n transaction happened here, and this is

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.540
the point where the redo record was committed to

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.310
the disk, so this is the portion which we're calling

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.700
as a window of vulnerability, and the app developer

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.810
is taking a chance, saying that I am so sure

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.310
that no crash is going to happen in this window,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.300
I'm going to go ahead and say no-flush. So, in other

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.870
words, the transaction is being used as an insurance, and

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.730
this should remind you of the old at the age

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.649
that we saw when we talked about shared memory systems. Shared memory systems

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.500
scale really well when you don't share

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.400
memory. Similarly, transactional systems scale really well,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.260
perform really well, when you don't use

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.590
the full semantic requirement of transaction, in

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.390
particular if you can get rid of

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.250
synchronous I/O, it'll make the performance better.
