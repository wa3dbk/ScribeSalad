00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.400
Perhaps, you were surprised by the last problem that you worked with Sarah. In

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.150
that problem, an object was shared with two variables. Let's have a closer look

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.285
at what happens in that case. Here, we have an object that's stored in a

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:19.180
variable. Now, it's important not to confuse the object which I've drawn here

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.360
with the variable. In Java, an object variable does not actually contain the

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.460
object. Instead, it contains information on how to find the object, it contains

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.844
the location of the object. We draw that location with an arrow and we call it

00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:47.560
a reference. Now, suppose we make a second variable and copy the first one into

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.240
the second. In that case, we simply copy this reference into this variable. As

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.435
you can see now, both the variable box and the variable box2 refer to the same

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:06.480
object. Now, suppose we call a mutator on one of the variables. As you can see,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.550
the object has changed. And that change is observable both through the variable

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.190
box and through the variable box2. That's just how object variables work in

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.346
Java. And it's good to know, because you can then explain how objects work when

00:01:24.346 --> 00:01:28.919
they're copied. Sarah will practice that with you with another problem.
