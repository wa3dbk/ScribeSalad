00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.408
Now to receive these callbacks. We first go back to the physics engine class

00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:06.288
and add a nice wrapper function that allows us to set some of the callback

00:00:06.288 --> 00:00:10.970
functions for box2D. In general Box2D allows you to get callbacks during

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.859
multiple phases of collision. We have a begin contact, which occurs when things

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.390
are touching, but the collision calculated hasn't done yet. End contact when

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.590
the contact analysis is over, and post solve which is called once the physics

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.953
collisions have occurred. For our purposes, we need to find a new function in

00:00:25.953 --> 00:00:29.345
the physics engine that allows the engine to pass in customs callbacks, to be

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:34.532
executed when anyone of these phases occurs. This code is fairly simple

00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:38.286
although deep. We take in an object that contains callbacks we're looking for

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.454
and define logic that will issue a callback to those functions, once the engine

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:46.080
hits that phase. So, for instance, we assume that is the callbacks.PostSolve

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.030
method exists, then we define the PostSolve method on our listener as a

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.768
function that takes in the contact and impulse, pass for Box2D. And we'll

00:00:53.768 --> 00:00:56.666
actually send that to the PostSolve function in our contact, giving it the 2

00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:00.614
bodies for the fixtures that are touching. Now Box2D operates in a different

00:01:00.614 --> 00:01:03.686
environment than we do. That is that it operates in fixtures that are

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:07.846
colliding, and we have to go then fetch the body object that we're using. Once

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:10.786
we've set all of our callback handlers that we want, we actually can call

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:15.357
world.SetContactListener and pass in the listener object. This will effectively

00:01:15.357 --> 00:01:18.484
bake in all of our contact objects into the world, so that any time we get

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:22.451
these collision objects, we'll get collision callbacks.
