00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.229
Okay. The real answer is none of these. For 2 to the 4th, I know that's 2 times

00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:12.500
2 times 2 times 2. I have repeated multiplication 4 times, so I get 16. That's

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:18.453
definitely not 18. For 3 to the 6th, I have 3 times 3 times 3 times 3 times 3

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:22.681
times 3, which is really 9 times 9 times 9, or 729.

00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:28.395
That's definitely not 18. 6 to the 3rd is 6 times 6 times 6. So, I get 216.

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:34.515
Here, I just have 9 squared. So, 9 times 9. I have the repeated multiplication

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:40.390
of 9. Well, that makes 81. 81 isn't 18 even though they both have digits of 8

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:44.839
and 1. For this last one, I just have 1 18 times. That's a lot a 1's. But I know

00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:48.867
1 times 1 times 1 times 1 is always just going to be 1. So, this answer is going

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:53.299
to equal 1. So, that's not it either. This is why it's important to think about

00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:57.416
what an exponent means. Most of the math you do on a daily basis involves

00:00:57.428 --> 00:01:02.025
multiplication. That's why it's so easy to think of exponents as multiplication.

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:06.762
We have to slow down and remind ourselves that 2 to the 4th isn't really 8, it's

00:01:06.774 --> 00:01:09.217
really 16. Just like 9 squared is really 81.
