00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.764
Let's start by considering just these first two terms, x squared plus 6x, and we

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.084
want to complete the square with these 2 terms as the first 2 terms of that

00:00:09.084 --> 00:00:13.716
squared polynomial. Then the constant we need to add at the end is 9, since 6

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:17.525
over 2 is 3 and 3 squared is 9. However, if we want to add 9 inside here,

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:21.490
without actually adding anything total to either side of the quation, then we

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.382
need to talso subtract 9 from somewhere on the right side. So that's exactly

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:29.186
what I did. I wrote plus 9 inside the parenthesis, and then a minus 9 next to

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:32.962
the plus 3 outside. Remember that because all of these terms are just added

00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:37.424
together, these parenthesis here are really just for notation. They're just to

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:42.270
help me visualize that these terms belong together. This doesn't, in any way,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.221
change the way these terms are combined. The factored form of x squared plus 6x

00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:51.553
plus 9 is x plus 3 squared, and negative 9 plus 3 is just minus 6. So the

00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:56.037
completed square form of y equals x squared plus 6x plus 3 is y equals the

00:00:56.037 --> 00:00:58.253
quantity x plus 3 squared minus 6.
