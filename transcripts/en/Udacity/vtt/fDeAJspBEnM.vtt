00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.830
One reason to build this network
by stacking simple operations,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.630
like multiplications, and sums,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.490
and RELUs, on top of each other is
that it makes the math very simple.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.420
Simple enough that a deep learning
framework can manage it for you.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.330
The key mathematical
insight is the chain rule.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.140
If you have two functions
that get composed, that is,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.390
one is applied to
the output of the other,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.550
then the chain rule tells you that you
can compute the derivatives of that

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.119
function simply by taking the product
of the derivatives of the components.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.720
That's very powerful.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.440
As long as you know how to write
the derivatives of your individual

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.540
functions, there is a simple graphical
way to combine them together and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.720
compute the derivative for
the whole function.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.710
There's even better news for
the computer scientist in you.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.700
There is a way to write this chain rule
that is very efficient computationally,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.230
with lots of data reuse, and that looks
like a very simple data pipeline.
