00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.873
Supplementary must mean that the two angles add up to 180 degrees. We can see

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:08.940
that because angle R and angle Q add up to 180. This should also make sense,

00:00:09.048 --> 00:00:13.842
because a circle has 360 degrees. So, if I take half of it or draw a straight

00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:18.790
line through it, I know that's only 180 degrees, just like in this case. So, if

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:23.734
angle S and angle T are supplementary, they must add up to 180 degrees. I knew

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:28.152
angle S measures 55 degrees so I just need to find the measure of angle T. You

00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:32.494
can either think about it in your head or just subtract 55 degrees from both

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:36.760
sides. So, T is equal to 125 degrees. You might be saying, whoa, this doesn't

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:41.103
make sense. This angle is smaller than this angle and you're right. Well, it

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:45.740
turns out that this diagram isn't to scale. This would be a more accurate

00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:50.890
picture of our angle measures. We could find angle V in a similar fashion. We

00:00:50.902 --> 00:00:56.090
know U and V have to add up to 180 degrees and then, we subtract 12 degrees from

00:00:56.102 --> 00:01:00.515
both sides. So, V must be 168. If you got those two right, nice work.
