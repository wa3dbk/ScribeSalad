We can do this, the same sort of invention of new events were

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.130
appropriate to make sure that all of the news cases that we started out with

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.760
actually cause the machine or make the radio behave in a way we like or

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.030
behave. Well, we're going to stop the exercise here, but

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.310
there's some things which we would still have to do to get a complete model.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.060
Although this model process, we have undertaken seems quite long there's still

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.200
some things we'd have to do. We'd have to indicate what the default states for

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.860
each of the concurrent machines is. Recall that for

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.060
a state machine we can indicate what the state is when we turn things on, and

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.800
we would need to do that for these concurrent machines.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.760
We would have to place the guards on the transitions where required, and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.340
we'd have to invent these in, internal events.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.367
The results of this process can be seen in, in the diagram shown here.
