00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.070
So we just saved our computer program one pass over the entire array. Could we

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.441
do this even faster? Could we do it without looking at every single item in the

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:13.452
array? Take a moment to think. Imagine that there's one score that you don't

00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:18.336
read. What if that score was the min? If you don't read it, you can't find out

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:22.050
whether it's the minimum or not. We can't find the minimum without looking at

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.530
every score. In computer science we would say that we have to do a linear

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.040
search. Now what if we knew something more about the elements in this array.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.875
For example what if I knew that all of the elements were sorted from lowest to

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:38.720
highest. Then you wouldn't have to search the whole array to find the minimum.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.155
You would know that it was in the first position. As you continue programming,

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:44.779
you'll learn how to organize your data so you can get the information you need

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:48.723
as quickly as possible. But right now, let's talk more about discovering

00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:51.480
algorithms. Back to you, Kai.
