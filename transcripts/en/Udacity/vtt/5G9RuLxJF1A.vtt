00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.695
So, init is the most important of the Magic Methods. And nearly, every class

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:08.154
that you define will have init there. I want to introduce one other magic method

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:12.893
now. There are many, many others. We're only going to cover one more today,

00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:17.190
which is the str magic method. And what str should do is return the string

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.410
representation of this instance. So, here's why str is so useful. Every Python

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.261
object can be printed. Say, we can a number and we get three, we can print a

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:29.561
list, we get something that looks at the list. When we print one of our

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:32.598
restaurant objects, well, it tells us there's a restaurant object, but it

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:37.170
doesn't tell us anything useful about it. What's happening when we print things,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.588
the Python internal definition of print is using str to turn an object into a

00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:47.913
string, that's str operator like this. Str can turn any object into a string,

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:52.928
and you'll notice that the results here are of type string, or type str. When we

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:56.170
do str on one of our restaurant objects, well, we get back to this string.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.234
That's because we haven't defined a magic__str method. If we do that, we'll get

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:04.203
something more useful. So, let's do that.
