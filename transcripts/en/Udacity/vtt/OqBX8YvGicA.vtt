So here are three UML profile diagrams. Notice that above the class

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.430
names are some stereotypes. Those are the things in the double angle brackets.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.760
And the particular stereotypes here are metaclass and stereotype.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.890
So we're talking at the meta level. There's also some inheritance going on here.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.030
The overall purpose of these particular examples has to do with

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.870
extending the UML language to deal with describing certain kinds of systems.
