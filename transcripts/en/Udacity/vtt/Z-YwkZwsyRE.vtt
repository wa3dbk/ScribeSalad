00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.050
So now, I want us to start looking deeper.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.090
And start looking at these images and

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.520
start seeing what are the numeric values at each and every pixel.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.100
And what in different may, ways, what representation do they have?

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.890
And how can you actually start doing these simple types of computations on it?

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.810
Here I'm showing a simple image of the mandrill image, the original image here.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.630
And to help us kind of look into it,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.830
I'm going to actually start zooming into it very closely.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.150
And start showing you exactly the details that actually would be seen if you

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.180
were actually that close up to that image, but

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.930
also start showing you the numerical values associated with an image like this.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.280
So here you note, I've actually put a small red box inside this image.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.370
This is a small red box about, eight pixels by eight pixels or

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.830
something like that.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.900
again, I'm showing you pictorial representations of it.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.490
Look at it more of an exercise of looking at how these types of images, and

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.110
what kind of information that we have in these images, less of the exact values.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.099
This is just now me showing a zoomed in version with the red region is.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.740
The next one I'll show you exactly what the red region looks like,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.960
namely this one.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.390
Now if you notice here there is a lot of white area and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.090
a little bit of a grayish area and kind of a, a dividing line between them,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.370
which is kind of where you would see the details of this.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.750
And you can see this in much more closeup here now.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.640
Of course, what you also should be seeing if the your display supports it,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.730
a little bit of blockiness in generated pixel.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.720
Again, because these are pixels that we have zoomed in and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.400
gotten really close to.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.580
If i had some magic, and

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.768
of course I do when I actually look at it computationally.

00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:41.610
I would been able to look at this image and not actually be able to look at

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.780
this image but the values that exist in each and every pixel.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.590
Let me zoom into exactly the level of the red pixel region that we have.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.434
And now if you notice, you should be seeing some numbers.

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:55.641
And you notice the numbers are like 159, 168 and

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.317
then lower numbers like 131, 132 here.

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:03.266
And approximately there is a little bit of a you know, the same kind of

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:07.490
thing here, where I have white values and a little bit of more gray values.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.240
Now again, this is just simply a pictorial way of looking at it.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.930
These numbers are not exact, even though I've attempted to match it as

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.150
closely as possible to this sub image here.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.940
A couple of things we can start doing now.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.960
And that is, start looking at this image a little bit more carefully and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.810
see what we can learn about different intensities and different directions.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.930
So here what I've done is, I've actually now drawn a line.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.310
Basically what I've done is remembering these are our different columns,

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.300
and in this there are different rows.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.360
I found one row, I've drawn this, and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.560
I've actually drawn a plot, of the values at that slice.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.825
And if you now traverse it, so

00:02:46.825 --> 00:02:49.658
I'm going to start kind of moving it from this way, and if you notice,

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:52.997
there are lots of darker values, of course, there is a lot of change going on,

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:56.354
and all of a sudden, when you come up here, there's a lot more higher values.

00:02:56.354 --> 00:03:01.196
Remember, that lower values kind of designate more of the darker shades of

00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:02.352
gray or black, and

00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:07.290
the brighter values are much more lighter shades of gray towards white.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.100
So white comes in, and here again you see a little bit of change, but now this

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.810
actually starts telling us a lot more about this image, just for that one slice.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.940
I also wanted to show that the same slicing can be done in the y axis.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.810
So, here, for example, we have looked at the one row, just one row.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.460
And if you look at it again, the same kind of stuff if you come in from the top

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.670
there's a lot of kind of various dark values.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.240
All of a sudden we see a lot more white values.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.360
And again, coming down to a lot more gray values.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.330
So this basically now starts saying we can start looking at these numbers.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.480
Even though the image is shown to us in this form or

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.870
this form, there are, underneath it, these values.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.730
And these are extremely important values for us, and

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.520
we can actually kind of start doing various types of visualizations of this, and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.000
these basically are just looking at the slices.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.400
So looking at this now, you should be seeing that basically we've kind of

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.310
looked at an image, been able to visualize it x and y slices.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.450
This should start suggesting, and especially looking at this this is basically.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.070
This is a two-dimensional representation where each and

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.930
every point is basically a pixel, which has its own intensity value.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.420
So the best way to represent this would be a matrix.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.470
This already kind of looks like a matrix.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.200
It's a two dimensional array.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.960
And each and every element of this matrix is a pixel and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.260
the value of that is basically the intensity value there.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.830
So an image can be therefore represented as a matrix.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.840
And the variance of all the vary, the values vary from zero, which is for

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.540
black, to 255 which is white.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.570
So this is a scale that goes from 255 to 0, 0 being pure black,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.150
that is no pixel is actually now showing any intensity whatsoever.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.360
And white, where the entire pixel is basically showing

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.370
the maximum intensity that is pure white.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.890
Of course, anywhere in between would be different shades of gray
