00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.642
Well we know that 5% is either less than 2 standard deviations below the mean or

00:00:06.642 --> 00:00:13.663
greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean. And since the distribution is

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:20.370
symmetrical then that means 2.5% is here and 2.5% is here. So our answer is 2.5%

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.531
since 262 is the value 2 standard deviations above the mean.
