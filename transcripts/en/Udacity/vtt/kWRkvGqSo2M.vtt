00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:05.838
The answer's 2 times 3a minus 7b squared. This was an example of a perfect

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:09.714
square practice problem. Did you get the right answer? Congratulations if you

00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:13.356
did. Let's see how we got that answer. Remember, whenever I factor any

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:17.850
polynomial, I want to look to see if there's a greatest common factor. When I

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.252
look at the variables, I can see there is not a variable portion of a greatest

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:27.066
common factor. But, I notice 18, 84 and 98 are all even numbers. Since they're

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:31.350
all even numbers, I know that there is a greatest common factor of two. So the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.555
first thing I want to do is factor out the two. When I factor out the greatest

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:43.680
common factor of two. I'm left with 9a squared minus 42 ab plus 49b squared.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.458
What I notice when I look at this problem is that the first term and the last

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:54.535
term are perfect squares. Let me write it that way. 9a squared can be written as

00:00:54.535 --> 00:01:01.968
the quantity 3a squared. 49b squared can be written as the quantity 7b squared.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.154
When I see a perfect square in the first term, and a perfect square in the

00:01:07.154 --> 00:01:11.703
second term. I have to check to see if the middle term is 2 times the square

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:16.733
root of the first term times the square root of the last term. Let's check. 2

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:28.143
times 3a times 7b is equal to. 21 times 2 is 42 ab. So we know that this is a.

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:32.816
Perfect square. Since the first term is 3a squared and the last term is 7b

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:37.289
squared and the middle term is 2 times the square root of the first term times

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.280
the square root of the last term, I know what's a perfect square. Now knowing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.535
that it's a perfect squire I have to remember the formula. The square root of

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:51.687
the first term is 3A. I nee a minus because the middle term is minus. And then

00:01:51.687 --> 00:01:55.951
the square root of the last term which is 7B and we square it. Now a good thing

00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.722
to do when you're doing these factoring problems is to check your asnwer. When

00:01:59.722 --> 00:02:07.423
you check you answer, let's foil this out. 3 a minus 7 b squared is 3 a minus 7

00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:16.095
b times 3 a minus 7 b. 3 a times 3 a is 9 a squared. 3 a times negative 7 b is

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:24.297
negative 21 a b. Negative 7 b times 3 a is negative 21 a b. And negative 7 b

00:02:24.297 --> 00:02:30.388
times negative 7 b is Positive 49b squared. So I can combine the 2 middle terms.

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:36.818
I can also multiply it through by 2. When I finish multiplying through by the

00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:42.350
gcf, I get 18a squared minus 84ab plus 98b squared. Which is what we started

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.833
with. So we know that we got the right answer.
