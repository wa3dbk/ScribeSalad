00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.280
So let's discuss the answer to our laptop

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.939
falls down quiz. For the pavement, the failure is

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.820
whatever causes the pavement to no longer perform its

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.020
function properly. Here, you might be tempted to say

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.140
that it needs to be replaced is the failure.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.550
But actually that's the repair of the failure. This

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.560
is fixing the pavement, it's not something that causes

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.320
it to deviate from its function. Really, it breaking,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.079
causing it to need to be replaced, so

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.110
breaking is the failure. What's the fault? It's the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.670
event that resulted in the first error. In

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.230
this case, it's not that the laptop fell out

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.290
of the bag, it had nothing to do with the pavement. Is it that the laptop hits

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.280
the pavement. And now what was the first error?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.630
Well, it was that the pavement developed a crack.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.150
The structure, the internal behavior of the pavement

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.360
is no longer the same as the proper

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.138
pavement. But we really notice this in terms

00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:02.459
of deviating from its specified function when it

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:08.020
broke. So we can still use a pavement with a crack. The crack expanded, so the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.270
error became bigger, but really until it broke,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
the pavement was functioning properly. So this is what

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.050
we get at the end.
