00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.830
Both Spin and Exokernel started out

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.000
with the assumption that microkernel-based operating

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.560
systems structure is inherently poised for

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.840
poor performance. Why did they start with

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.960
such an assumption? Well they used a popular microkernel of the time called

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.570
Mach which was developed at CMU as an exemplar for microkernel-based operating

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.830
system structure. But Mach had portability as an important goal. If

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.890
we keep performance as the primary goal, can we achieve that with a microkernal

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.450
based approach? In this lesson, we will look at L3, a microkernal based

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.590
operating system design that provides a contrarian viewpoint to the spin and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.840
exokernal assumption.
