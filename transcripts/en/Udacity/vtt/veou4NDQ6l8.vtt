00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
This question tests that you understand loops.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.670
Your goal is to define a procedure called countdown,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.010
that takes a positive whole number as its input,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.780
and it prints out a countdown from that number down to 1, followed by "Blastoff!"

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.980
Here is an example--

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.780
If we call countdown passing in 3--

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.780
your procedure should output 3--2--1--Blastoff!
