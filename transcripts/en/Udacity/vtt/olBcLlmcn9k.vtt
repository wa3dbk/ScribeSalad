00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.730
Here we have another pair of lines that are perpendicular to another, line s in

00:00:04.742 --> 00:00:09.493
orange and line t in teal. Just like last time, please find the slope of each of

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:13.829
these lines. See if after you find the slop of one of them, you can take a guess

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.985
at the slope of the other one before you calculate it.
