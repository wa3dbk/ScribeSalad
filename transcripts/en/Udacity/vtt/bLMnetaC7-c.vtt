Like I said just a couple of lines of code. We have remembered to keep track of

00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:07.260
our context, our primary gain node, and all of our currently loaded sound

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.948
effects. We also have an enabled flag that we can use the turn the entire sound

00:00:11.948 --> 00:00:16.213
engine off if we want to. Note that we use an object to keep track of our

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:20.812
effects instead of a list. This is important so that we can still query our

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.803
effects by our URL path.
