00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.311
We can find the volume of the concert hall by just multiplying these three

00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:08.276
different lengths together, since this is a rectangular prism. So we'll have 3

00:00:08.276 --> 00:00:12.460
x times 2 x times x plus 10. And of course it doesn't matter what order you

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.358
multiply these together in. We could leave the answer like this, or we could

00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:20.088
simplify. I like this form a bit better, we have V equals 6 x squared times the

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:23.119
quantity x plus 10. Awesome.
