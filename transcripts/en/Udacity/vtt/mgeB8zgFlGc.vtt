00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.771
It turns out we were adding the exponents together. Whenever we have a non zero

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:09.445
base x. We can simply combine their exponents by adding them. Just like in our

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:14.132
first problem we encountered. We had 3 to the third times 3 squared. Well, we

00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:18.908
knew we had 3 threes and 2 threes. And multiplied all together, 3 to the 5th.

00:00:18.908 --> 00:00:20.618
So, we added the exponents.
