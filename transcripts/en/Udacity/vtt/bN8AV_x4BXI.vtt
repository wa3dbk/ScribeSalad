00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.876
So far we've examined what are called local illumination models, where an

00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:06.880
object is affected by a light, and the result is sent to the eye. Light comes

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.585
only from, well, light sources. No light is reflected from other objects. There

00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:15.236
are many more light paths that can be tracked. One rendering technique that can

00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:18.834
simulate these is called ray tracing. We've seen how the GPU sends each object

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:23.150
triangle in turn to the screen and rasterizes it. Ray tracing instead fires

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.198
rays from the eye through each pixel. Objects are tested against each ray. The

00:00:27.198 --> 00:00:30.096
closest object found along a ray's path is the one that's used to compute the

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:34.112
ray's color contribution. You can think of each ray from the eye as rendering a

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:37.446
single one by one pixel. One way to find the closest object for this pixel is

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:41.454
to send every triangle down the pipeline in attempt to rasterize it. Using the

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:45.202
Z buffer to keep track of the closest object. This is perhaps the slowest way

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:49.096
ever to perform ray tracing. In reality, researchers and practitioners have

00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:52.132
spent huge amounts of time creating and tuning algorithms to rapidly find this

00:00:52.132 --> 00:00:56.180
closest object along the ray. Where rasterization gets some of its speed is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.203
from the fact that a single triangle usually covers a bunch of pixels. Various

00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:03.615
intermediate results can then be shared when processing the triangle. At its

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:07.348
simplest, ray tracing can give the same result as rasterization. Each ray from

00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:10.972
the eye finds the closest object along it. The effect of light on the surface

00:01:10.972 --> 00:01:14.733
is computed and the result is displayed. However that's just the starting point

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.129
for ray tracing. For the light to surface pass, we've made one obvious

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:22.844
simplification for basic rasterization. Objects don't block other objects. In

00:01:22.844 --> 00:01:26.312
other words, no shadows are cast. In ray tracing, adding basic shadows is

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:29.640
trivial. Shoot a ray from the surface to the light. If there's something in the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.140
way, the light is blocked and can be ignored. Since all computations happen in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.110
World Space we can avoid many of the precision problems found in rasterization

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.308
techniques, such as shadow mapping. Classical ray tracing also offers us the

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:44.544
ability to create true reflections in glass effects. For shiny surfaces, we can

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:48.632
spawn a new ray in the reflection direction. Whatever this ray hits is what is

00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:51.530
reflected in the surface, and so can be factored into the ray's final color,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.360
its radiance. Let's say our sphere is actually glass. Instead of simple

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.100
filtering, we can also spot a refraction ray and see where it hits. When it

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.460
encounters the other side of the sphere and exits, we spawn yet another

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.069
refraction ray in the reflection ray. We can continue to spawn rays until we

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.200
hit some limit.
