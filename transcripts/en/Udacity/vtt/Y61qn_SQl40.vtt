00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.350
A widely used symmetric
encryption scheme

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.710
is based on the data
encryption standard, or DES.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.180
It was published in 1977 and
standardized in 1979.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.850
In DES the key is 64 bit,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.870
which is 8 bites but for
each bite, there's one parity bit.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.100
Therefore, the actual value
in the key is only 56-bit.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.020
And the oppo cipher text
is again a 64-bit block.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.780
Here's a high level view of DES.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.520
There are 16 rounds of operations.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.350
&gt;From the origin of 56-bit key,
16 subkeys are generated.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.030
One for each round.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.460
The process of decryption with DES,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.890
is essentially the same as
the encryption process.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.880
It works as follows.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.170
Use the cipher text as input to this.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.040
But then, for sub keys,
they use in reverse order.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.230
That is use key 16 at
the first round of decryption.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.320
Use key 15in the second
round of decryption.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.110
And so and so forth.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.830
That is for decryption,
we run the same algorithm.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.320
But only the keys in reverse order.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.170
We call that diffusion is one of
the principles in encryption and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.690
it is typically achieved
through permutation.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.330
In DES, permutation works by
changing the positions of the bits.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.240
Recall that DES has 16
rounds of operations.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.320
Each DES round has the same operations
and uses a different per round key.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.718
Each DES round takes as input the server
text produced by the previous round.

00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:49.660
And outputs text for the next round.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.950
The input is divided into
the left half and the right half.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.520
The output left half is just
the right half of the input.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.650
The right half of the output is a result
of the left half of the input and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.340
the output of the function.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.970
The mangler function takes this input,
the 32 bit input right half,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.370
expands it to 48 bit,
then with the 48 bit program key.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.720
Then use the s-boxes to substitute
the 48 bit value into a 32 bit value.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.260
We can also use algebra to
represent your in a death round.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.840
That is, the left half of output
is the right half of the input.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.570
And the right half of the input is
the result of the left half of input.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.730
And the result of a mangler function,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.576
which takes as input the right half
of the input and the [INAUDIBLE] key.
