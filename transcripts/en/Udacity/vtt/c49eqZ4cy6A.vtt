Just like with an equation, if we do the same thing to an inequality, we should

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:07.759
be able to find some way to keep the statement true as we move down through our

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.870
manipulation. So let's say, I'm super committed to dividing both sides of this

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.809
by negative 1. What inequality do we need here then, in between the negative 1

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.100
and the negative 2? Please fill in the proper symbol in this box.
