00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you look again at our earlier steps in the deduction process,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you will find that each of these steps precisely follows

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
either the data dependency or a control dependency.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let me use red to show data dependencies

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and green to show control dependencies.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We start with the failing assertion.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here, out has a less than character in there.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Where does out come from?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We can follow it back, using the data dependency, to this statement.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We can also follow it back to the earlier statement,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but that is not so much of interest,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because here, out is just empty,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and with an empty string, this assertion would not have fired.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
By following back the control dependency, we find the tag was false.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is step 2 in the deduction process.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And we also know that C in here was a less than character,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and since this up here controlled whether the addition to out was executed or not,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we also get a control dependency up here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This statement was not executed,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and this condition controlled it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Therefore, we can deduce that quote was true.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This is step 3 in here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So we now find the place where quote was set.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This was down here, again, the data dependency,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and since this was executed,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the governing condition with a double quote character must have been true.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So we start with a failing assertion,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
follow back the data dependency to out,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
follow back the control dependency to quote,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
follow back another data dependency to quote,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and then, finally get to the governing condition in here,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
which also is the place where the defect is.
