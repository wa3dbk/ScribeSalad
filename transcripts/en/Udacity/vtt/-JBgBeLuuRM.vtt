We're starting to see that some equations for parabolas can't be factored. When

00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:08.602
that's the case, we need another method of finding where they intersect the

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.760
horizontal axis. Let's look at this equation, y equals 3 x squared plus 6 x

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.036
minus 10. Now if we want to find the x intercepts, what equation are we really

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:21.269
trying to solve? Please put you answer with the full equation in this orange

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.581
box.
