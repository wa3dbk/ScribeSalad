00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.360
The Android plugin can handle
a large range of use cases, but

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.440
it has sensible enough defaults to
make simple builds straightforward.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.690
In addition to handling the actual
business of building and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.630
packaging your app, the Android
plugin provides a bunch of different

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.510
configuration and customization
options for us to mess with.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.760
Of these available capabilities,
we'll be covering six main themes.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.570
That Android developers are commonly
find themselves wanting to do in

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.660
their Gradle Android builds.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.670
The first is build variants.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.760
It's often useful to build slightly
different versions of the same app,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.570
such as debug version for
testing and a release version for

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.050
the Google Play store.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.070
Another common use case is a free
version and a paid version of your app.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.270
The Android plugin makes
it easy to share code and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.148
other common resources
between these variants.

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:46.220
Second, the androidplug in
allows us to manage dependencies

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.520
on a per variant basis.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.300
Third, the android plugin
can override resources and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.260
manifest entries also
on a per variant basis.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.070
In lesson four we'll talk about some
of the more advanced features of

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.830
the android plugin which
include application signing,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.990
pro guarding and testing
