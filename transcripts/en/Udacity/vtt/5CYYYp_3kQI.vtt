00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:04.550
The class projects will be based on the Raven's Progressive Matrices test of

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.140
intelligence. This test was written in the 1930s to examine general human

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.290
intelligence. It consists of 60 multiple-choice visual analogy problems.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.580
The Raven's test is unique among intelligence test in that all problems in

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.090
the Raven's test are strictly visual. No words. It is the most widespread,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.020
the most commonly used, the most reliable test of intelligence. The Raven's test

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.220
consists of two kinds of problems, two by two matrix problems and

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.510
three by three matrix problems. We'll also consider a special case of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.259
two by one matrix problems. They're not part of the original test. But

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:47.750
they will providing a baseline for starting to construct AI agents. Your project

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.500
will be to implement AI agents that can solve problems like those that appear in

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.720
the Raven's Test of Intelligence. Let's look at a few sample problems right now.
