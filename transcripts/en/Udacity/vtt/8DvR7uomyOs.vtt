00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.750
Here's our final answer. Excellent work if you figured that one out. We know

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.220
that a square or an exponent of two means that we write this out twice. We're

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.830
multiplying this binomial by itself. Next we want to distribute 3 root 3 to our

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.570
second binomial. So for the first term we'll have 3 root three times 3 root 3.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.802
For the second term we'll have 3 root 3 times 5. Once we've distributed that 3,

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:30.653
3 now we want to distribute this positive 5, well that positive 5 times 3, 3 or

00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:35.504
the 3rd term and positive 5 times positive 5 for a 4th term, we multiply these

00:00:35.504 --> 00:00:40.355
two terms together to get 9 times 3, when were at the square root of any number

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:45.129
times itself is just that number For these two terms, we'll 15 root 3, and 15

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:55.462
root 3, and on the end we have a positive 25. We can combine these terms

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:59.890
together, since they both have a radical of square root of 3. So we have 30

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.902
square roots of 3, 9 times 3 is 27, and I move this 25 over here, so I can add

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:12.430
my like terms together to get the final result. Great thinking if you got here.
