00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.600
Here's another problem similar to the last one. Just to keep checking your

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.070
understanding of these log properties. Once again, figure out the value of the

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.500
expression on either side of each equation. And then use that information to

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
figure out which of these equations is true.
