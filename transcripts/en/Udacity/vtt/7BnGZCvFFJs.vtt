00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.905
To do this, I first want to look at the structure of credit card and see what

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:06.932
I'm given already. I'm implementing a method, is valid, which returns a

00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:12.565
Boolean. Is valid calculates whether the credit card has a valid number. And

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:16.695
returns true if the number's valid and false if it's not. So now I know how to

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:21.608
write my test program. I need to create two credit cards. I'll create a valid

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:27.947
card. And I have to mark that this is a long, by writing the L at the end. And

00:00:27.947 --> 00:00:32.228
I switched two digits to get the invalid card. Now I print out the actual value

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:35.708
of isValid when called on the valid card, and I expect the valid card to be

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:41.241
valid. The actual for the invalid card should be false. Now, it would be easy

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:45.858
to test whether our implementation works. In the credit card class we can see

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:49.579
that the first part of the pseudocode setting sum to 0 and count to 0, is the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.470
same as the code that had before for computing the sum of digits. So I'll keep

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.680
that the same. The for each digit starting from the right part is the same. So

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.218
I'll try to keep the code for counting the iterations in place. But now,

00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:08.440
instead of just adding the digit to the sum, I need to check whether the count

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.527
is even or odd and how big the digit is, and use that to decide what to do with

00:01:12.527 --> 00:01:21.430
the sum. So, if the count mod 2 is 1, we add the digit to the sum. Else, if the

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.287
digit is less than 5. We add twice the digit to the sum. Otherwise, we add

00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:31.076
twice the digit to the sum and subtract nine. And now, instead of just printing

00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:35.324
the sum the way we did before, we need to check whether the card number is

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:40.958
valid. If the last digit of the sum is zero, the card number is valid. Some mod

00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:45.386
10 equals equals 0 is true when the last digit of sum is 0, and false

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:52.248
otherwise. So we return that. For example, if the sum were 24, we would check

00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:58.381
sum mod 10 would be 4 which is not 0. So, returning this result would return

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:04.367
false. If sum were 20, then we would check sum mod 10 is 0. So this would be

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:06.746
true, so we would return true, but we can't be sure that this works until we

00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:13.598
test it. Let's compile and run the tester, huh. One of our tests failed. It's

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:17.303
saying that the invalid card is valid. We're going to need more information if

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.235
we want to debug this. What if I print each digit of the number? So if we run

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:28.526
the credit card tester. That's funny. It printed exactly the same thing. My

00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:32.332
print line statement must not have run. For this statement not to run, we would

00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:38.827
have to never go into the loop. What's n? If I run it again, I find that n is

00:02:38.827 --> 00:02:45.452
this weird negative number. That looks a little bit like the result of an

00:02:45.452 --> 00:02:51.763
integer overflow. Clearly, n can't be an int anymore. Now, if I try to compile.

00:02:51.763 --> 00:02:57.806
I get a possible loss of precision. So if I want an int digit, I'm going to

00:02:57.806 --> 00:03:02.849
have to cast this somehow. What if I try casting n mod 10 this way? Looks like

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.837
I didn't remove the cast that was causing trouble. Now, it looks like it's

00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:13.245
starting with the correct n. And then taking off one digit at a time correctly.

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:17.645
But it's still getting the wrong answer for the valid card. I'll delete this,

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:21.956
now that I have that part working. And I think I actually want to print out the

00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:26.908
digit itself, rather than n. And then I want to get some idea of what I do with

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:31.983
each digit. So I'll print the digit. And then, on the same line. I'll print,

00:03:31.983 --> 00:03:36.123
add it to the sum, add twice the digit to the sum, or add twice the digit and

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:41.370
subtract 9. Now, if I run the tester again, I should get much better

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.324
information. It looks like the first digit is minus 9, but none of the digits

00:03:47.324 --> 00:03:53.994
should be negative. It looks like this cast didn't work properly. Maybe it's

00:03:53.994 --> 00:03:59.240
casting n before it takes the mod 10, instead of casting the result of the n

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.021
mod 10. Let's see if these parentheses fix it. Now, if I run the main method

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:09.697
again, you can see I'm still not getting what I expected. But I have some good

00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:14.674
data here. For 3, I add twice the digit to the sum, 1, I add twice the digit to

00:04:14.674 --> 00:04:20.165
the sum. And so on. Let's compare that with the example on the web page. In the

00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:24.860
example, the three shouldn't get doubled. The one should though. The next one

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.802
shouldn't. The 9 should. In fact, it looks like we're adding twice the digit,

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:37.390
way too often here. It's seems like count mod 2, never equals 1. So let's check

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:44.378
what count is. With System.out.println("count:" + count). Now the main method

00:04:44.378 --> 00:04:51.255
says count is always 0. I know how to fix that. I'll increment count. Now, for

00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:55.490
the validCard I'm getting true when I expected true. And for the invalid card,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.540
I'm getting false when I expected false. I have just a tiny bit of cleanup left

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.508
to do. To remove all of these extra system out print lines, that I added. I

00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:09.090
removed all of the print statements, in the credit card class. And now when I

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.709
run the test, the output is much cleaner.
