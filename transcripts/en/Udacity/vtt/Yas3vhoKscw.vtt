00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.804
It's a fact of life that no matter how hard we try our programs have bugs. In

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:08.602
the olden days, computers had real bugs. For example, the moth that you see

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.201
here got trapped in a relay of the very first computer in the United States

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:17.805
causing it to malfunction. But of course, nowadays, the bugs are usually the

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:22.964
fault of the programmer by not having thought through everything. And that's

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:26.425
normal. You can find simple bugs by putting print statements into your code,

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:31.060
printing out everything in sight. Seeing what goes wrong, and then removing the

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.296
print statements again, but that's no fun. There's a nifty software tool called

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:39.290
a debugger, that you can use to control your program. Stop it and look around,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.188
and then find out what it actually does as opposed to what you think it's been

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:47.240
doing. Using a debugger is pretty simple, there are three key concepts that you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.026
need to master. You can set breakpoints in your program, and then that the

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:55.001
debugger will stop when the program reaches a breakpoint. You can then step

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.992
through your program one instruction at a time. And you can even step inside

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:04.004
method calls. And finally, you can inspect the contents of variables. So if you

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.972
have a variable, you can ask the debugger what's inside at this point. So,

00:01:07.972 --> 00:01:11.510
these are the three key concepts that you want to keep in mind. Let me show you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.655
how to do these in BlueJ. This example program, tries to count the syllables in

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:21.495
a word. Let me show you. enter a few words. And as you can see, the program

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:27.629
doesn't seem to be doing so well. Hello has two syllables, not one. Yellow also

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:32.708
has two. Oh, peach has one. Before debugging this program, let's have a quick

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:38.064
look at algorithm is used to count the syllables. Here is our algorithm. We

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:42.498
look for groups of vowels. There's one here, another group of length one, and

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:48.146
another one, and we count the groups. This word has three syllables. However,

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:52.114
here we'll count this group, but we won't count an "e" at the end, because nice

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:57.400
only has one syllable. That second rule trips us up with some very short words

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.087
such as the. We're not counting the E would give us zero syllables and we'll

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:07.314
say if that happens we'll change the count to one. To summarize, we count vowel

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:11.966
groups but not a final e and if that count gives us zero, we change it one. Now

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:16.296
on, just seeing the debugger in action. Open the syllable counter program in

00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:20.427
BlueJ, and I really suggest that you do that with me. Click in this column here

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:24.380
next to the first line of the main method and you'll see a tiny stop sign,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.100
that's a break point. Now, run the program in the usual way, and now the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.692
debugger wakes up. We've hit this break point and what you see over here is the

00:02:36.692 --> 00:02:43.278
console that controls the debugger. These buttons here, let you step through

00:02:43.278 --> 00:02:47.685
the program. Let's try it out. We'll click on step and you can see that we're

00:02:47.685 --> 00:02:52.705
now in the next line. We click on step again, oh, now it has produced the

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:58.770
output here. And we're back where the little arrow is. Now when we step nothing

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.047
seems to be happening, the arrow is gone. That's because right now, we're

00:03:03.047 --> 00:03:06.584
reading input. Let's look at the terminal window and here it is waiting for the

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:11.634
input. I'll just apply it. Now I hit Enter, and you can see the debugger window

00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:17.844
again. And back here our program has advanced by one step. Let's bring this to

00:03:17.844 --> 00:03:22.003
the front. And we're past here. Now to make sure that you are trying this at

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:27.512
home, let me ask you to do exactly what I did. Set the break point here, enter

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:31.867
hello yellow peach, keep signal stepping. And I'd like you to tell me, how many

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:35.332
times are you hitting this line, the call to the constructor, before you get

00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:37.540
out of the loop.
