00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.110
Before we can begin to create or

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.610
even recreate visualizations, we need to understand data and data types.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.240
Almost anything can be turned into data.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.260
Let's take a look at a well noted graphic, and see its data types.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.770
This visualization comes from Hans Rothstein's work with global health data.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.920
If you have five minutes, I highly encourage you to watch Hans narrate

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.430
this visualization in the video linked in the instructor notes.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.660
Han gives a charismatic performance that makes this data come alive.

00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:32.450
Now, I want to highlight the different data types that can be found in

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.980
this visualization.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.150
Let's start with the quantitative data, or

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.170
any variables that have exact numbers.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.538
These include variables like life expectancy,

00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:50.110
income per person, total population, and year.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.865
Quantitative data can be discreet or

00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:56.950
continuous, and typically, variables that are countable are considered discreet.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.930
In this case, total population would be considered a discreet variable,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.730
while income per person would be a continuous variable.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.370
Another data type that appears in this visualization is categorical data.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.890
Nominal data is a way of labelling or categorizing the data into groups.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.749
In this case, the countries of the world are grouped into regions.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.590
The Americas are colored yellow, and sub-Saharan Africa is colored blue.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.586
Categorical data may take on numerical values, but

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:30.093
these numerical values won't necessarily carry any mathematical meaning.

00:01:30.093 --> 00:01:34.300
One final type of data not shown in this visualization, is ordered data.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.770
Ordered data is similar to categorical data,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.390
except that the categories are ordered or ranked in some particular way.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.970
One example would be is if I took the populations of each country, and

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.420
then split them up into bins.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.250
For example, I could have four groups where each of the countries falls into

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.500
a population bin if their population is between 0 and 10 million, 10 and

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.410
100 million, 100 and 500 million, or greater than 500 million.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.130
In this example, we're pretty much just taking quantitative data, and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.490
splitting it into groups.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.140
So we have bins or categories of other types of data.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.530
A slightly different example would be class difficulty, such as beginner,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.400
intermediate, and advanced.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.010
Those three types of classes would be a way that we could label the classes, and

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.270
they have a natural order in increasing difficulty.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.180
As data scientists, it's important for

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.370
us to know that each of these data types can be encoded visually.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.541
And in the next few videos, we'll dive into how we can make

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.972
appropriate choices for visual encodings, based on the different data types.

00:02:37.972 --> 00:02:40.469
This was just a brief overview of data types.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.861
And if these concepts are still a bit fuzzy for you, we recommend that you

00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:47.940
watch the three videos from the Instructional Data Science class.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.150
These videos are linked in the instructor notes.
