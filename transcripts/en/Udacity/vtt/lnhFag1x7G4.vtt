would need to be modified with the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.596
para virtualization technology is minuscule, less than

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:17.620
2%. And this is shown By proof of construction and then, what they did,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.120
was to implement multiple operating system on

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.910
top of Xen, with para virtualized hyperviser. .
