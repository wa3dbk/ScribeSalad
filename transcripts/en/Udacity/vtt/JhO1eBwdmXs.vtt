00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.550
We can also transform our logarithmic functions in the same way that we have

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.240
moved other functions around. How about we start with this function f of x

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.280
equals log base 2 of x. First try graphing the transformed function f of x

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.080
equals log base 2 of x plus 2. Take a second to do this right now. After you've

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.340
taken a second to do that, please fill in the words in the sentence. To

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.280
properly describe the transformation that happened was the shift of vertical or

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.658
horizontal one, in which direction did it happen and by how many units.
