00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:08.932
Euler's number and the exponential function based on that number are of vital importance in the theory of differential equations.

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:16.065
Whenever we are dealing with exponential growth or exponential decay, and whenever we deal with oscillations,

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:22.099
Euler's number plays a big role. This is a brief and informed introduction to that topic, for which we need a minimum

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.166
amount of prerequisites. In particular, you should know that five to the first power equals five.

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:38.632
Five to the zeroth power equals one. Five to the minus second power equals one over 25.

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:43.599
Five to the power of one half equals the square root of five.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:53.566
Five to the third power times five to the fourth power equals five to the power of three plus four--seven.

00:00:53.567 --> 00:01:01.566
And five to the third power to the fourth power equals five to the power of 12--three times four.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.932
This is what you need to know about powers of numbers.

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:13.032
In addition, you should have an idea about derivatives in this D, DX notation--for instance, the derivate of X squared

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:20.333
with respect to X equals 2X. And you should have an idea of how this is connected with the slope of the tangent line.
