00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.410
v Would equal w divided by at minus 1. Great effort for getting that one

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.287
correct. When we multiplied both sides by the lowest common denominator, or vt,

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:16.268
we can see that these two factors will cancel. We're left with avt equals v plus

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:20.730
w. We subtract v from both sides to solve for v, or really to isolate it on one

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.750
side of the equation. Now that we're here, we have to factor this V out. When we

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.250
factor the V out, we'll have V times AT minus one, and then we can divide by

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.507
this quantity to get one V alone. V would equal this expression. Keep in mind,

00:00:35.507 --> 00:00:39.673
this is simplifying the one. I hope you're becoming a pro at these.
