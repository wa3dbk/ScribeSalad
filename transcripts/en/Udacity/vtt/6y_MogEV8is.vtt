00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
To evaluate how accessible any app is,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.530
you can step through the
Accessibility Testing Checklist.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.580
Some of those steps will involve
changing the accessibility settings

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.850
in the setting's app.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.360
The user will be able to choose
from these options.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.370
We have TalkBack, Captions, Magnification,
increased font size, and more.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.540
I want to point out one item
in particular, TalkBack service.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.940
Blind and low vision users 
can turn on the TalkBack service.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.146
It allows them to navigate
around the device

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:28.792
with spoken feedback
as they interact

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:30.830
with each UI element on the screen.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.445
There are slightly different gestures

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.752
for example to select,
or to focus on an item.

00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:37.650
If it's the first time you turn it on, 
there will be a tutorial

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.220
that you can step through.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.490
When the user navigates 
to these elements

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.590
TalkBack service will read aloud 
the context description provided.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.480
Every UI component that doesn't have
any visible text has a content description.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.313
Using TalkBack or another
accessibility tool from the checklist,

00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:52.556
open the Sunshine app,

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:55.880
find and fix at least one 
accessibility issue in the app.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.670
Then please share what you did 
in the class discussion forum.
