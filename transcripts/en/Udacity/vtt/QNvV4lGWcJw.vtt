00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's get started on this by looking at the test cases instead of the code.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Our buggy program worked fine when row 0 had the duplicates,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but it didn't work well when row 1 had the duplicates.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, probably we're not handling the row correctly.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's go up and see if that intuition pans out. In fact, it does.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're looping over all of the rows in range size.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But if you look down in this code, although we introduced the variable row, we never really use it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Just use it over here. We're not using in all that much.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Remember, I want to check to see that all of the numbers in these row are unique within that row.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Conceptually, that's two references to row and I only see one over here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The bug in this code is that we're always checking the 0 true board.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We should be checking the current row against itself,

00:00:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and that single word fix causes us to get the answers as we works on.
