00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.700
If we go up the y-axis to find where y equals 19, we come just below the upper

00:00:04.712 --> 00:00:09.440
bound of this graph. Then, we need to slide over, staying at that horizontal

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:14.510
position, until we meet our line. That gives us this point right here. To figure

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:19.460
out that x coordinate at that point, we follow straight down from that point to

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:26.075
the x-xis and see that we hit 5. This must mean that when y equals 19 somewhere

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:29.196
along this line, x is also equal to 5.
