00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's get 1 more view into how this relationship

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
between grammars and parsing states plays out.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've written a new grammar over here on the left,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but actually if you think about it, it's simpler than our old grammars.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Since this one isn't recursive, there are only a finite number of strings in the language--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
INT + string and INT alone.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's say that the full input is going to be INT + INT,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is not in the language of the grammar,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but thus far, we've only seen a single token--INT.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Our parser has to handle good input and also malformed input.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Not everything out there on the web is super clean.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We're going to want to write a web browser that can tell the difference between

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the good and the bad, the wheat and the chaff.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So what I'd like you to do is figure out after just 1 token of the input,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
what are some parse states we could be in?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I've listed 7 possible parse states in this multiple multiple-choice quiz.

00:00:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I would like you to check each one if we could be in it, after seeing only 1 token of this input.
