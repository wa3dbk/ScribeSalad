00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.490
Here we can see a time series plot of U.S. civilian unemployment rate over time.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.730
The data goes all the way back to about 1950,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.430
and all the way up until the present time.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.650
On the Y axis we have unemployment percent.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.970
If you notice it tops out at around 11% and the lowest value is around 3%.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.090
Something to always be careful of with your plots is to clearly label and

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.820
be aware of what the ranges of your data are.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.850
Both on the Y and on the X.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.160
In this case, since we are plotting a time series,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.260
every point is not completely independent of every other point.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.040
The X variables here depend on one another.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.388
Since the value at time X depends on X minus 1.

00:00:46.388 --> 00:00:48.315
In more concrete terms,

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:54.474
the unemployment in 1970 is some delta from the unemployment in 1969.

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:59.177
And the unemployment rate in 1969 is some change from the unemployment rate

00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:00.030
in 1968.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.000
Since we're trying to convey how something's changed over time, a line plot is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.740
the most natural and easily understandable of all the chart types.
