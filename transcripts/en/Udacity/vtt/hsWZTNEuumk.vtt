00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.435
The intersection of A and B contain the elements 5 and 15. The union of A and B

00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:10.680
contain the elements 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, 15, 17 and 18. How do we get that the

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:16.280
intersection of A and B just contains 5 and 15? We know that intersection means

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:20.967
and. So, we have to find the numbers that are in set A and in set B. Well,

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:25.798
there's only two numbers that are in both sets. Here, 5 is in both sets, and 15

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.462
is in both sets. And those are the only two numbers that are in both sets. So,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.105
the intersection of A and B is 5 and 15. When I want to find the union of two

00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:37.521
sets, I know that union means or.

00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:42.630
So, I want all of the elements that are in set A or in set B, which basically

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:48.262
means all of the elements in both sets. So, I have 1, 2, 5. Now, even though

00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:54.021
five is in both sets, we only write it one time. And then I have 8, 9, 12, and

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:59.191
again 15 is in both sets, but we only write it once. And then I have 17, and I

00:00:59.203 --> 00:00:59.703
have 18.
