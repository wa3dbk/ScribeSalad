00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.640
Now let's see how well this works when we

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.040
have something like a branch that is just always

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.521
taken. In that case, the entry for that branch

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:14.479
will just be all ones in the history. That branch

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.930
has a fixed PC. It always has the same

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.784
history. When we XOR them, we will be using only

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:23.138
one 2-bit counter. So pretty much, although we have

00:00:23.138 --> 00:00:25.490
a long history, if the branch is just a repetition

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.394
of the same thing, we are ending up using

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:30.817
only one of the 2-bit counters. So the additional cost,

00:00:30.817 --> 00:00:33.439
relative to just having an array of 2-bit counters,

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:35.833
is that now we are keeping an 11-bit history for

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.125
this branch. So still the cost is not just

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:43.885
2-bits, it's really, let's say 11 or 16-bits plus 2,

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:46.945
but it's much less than a long history plus

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:50.520
2 to the Nth times a 2-bit counter. If we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150
have a branch that is never taken, we can do

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.270
the same reasoning and end up using a single counter.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.922
If we have a branch that has something like NT,

00:01:00.922 --> 00:01:04.322
NT, it really only has two possible histories, zero one,

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:07.450
zero one, zero one, etcetera or one zero, one zero,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.810
one zero, etcetera. So it ends up using two counters.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.422
So if we have a lot of these counters as

00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:16.210
you can see, most branches are going to be like these.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.640
We will be using very, very few entries

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.040
by these branches, which leaves us plenty of counters

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550
for branches where we have a very long

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.180
pattern. Where we will be using something like, you

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.770
know, 16 histories and thus use something like

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.737
16 counters. As you can see in this organization

00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:37.942
pretty much, the branch is that need more

00:01:37.942 --> 00:01:41.344
counters get them; branches that need relatively few counters

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:44.109
get them. The only really additional cost

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.320
relative to just having the counters is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.218
the histories. The downside is that again,

00:01:50.218 --> 00:01:54.481
some branches with particular histories might overlap in

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.787
which counter they use, with other branches

00:01:57.787 --> 00:02:01.780
and other histories. Pretty much, my branch

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.175
XOR with its history, might map to the same counter as some other branch, and

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:12.380
its own history, when they're XOR. But this happens very rarely

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.470
if the BHT is large, and now it can be large because each entry is just 2-bits.
