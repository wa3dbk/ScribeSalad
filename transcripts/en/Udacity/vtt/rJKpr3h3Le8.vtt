00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey there.
So I was thinking,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.430
why don't you warm up by working on
the detail view for the shopping list.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.300
I've been working on a detail view for
the shopping list object.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.370
It's in the activeListDetails
package that I just gave to you.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.030
Nothing is hooked up yet, though,
to actually display this screen.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.513
Could you make it so that when you click
on the text of the shopping list right

00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:20.093
here It opens up a detail
view of the shopping list?

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:22.987
And the name of the shopping list on
the detail screen should exactly match

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:25.570
the name of the shopping list
that you clicked to open it.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.850
This should be a review of
some of the Android code and

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.440
Firebase skills that you learned
in version 0.1 of the app.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.740
And actually, one more thing.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.540
So I've been working on
a new workflow for us.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.764
And basically how it's going to work
is I will describe a new feature and

00:00:38.764 --> 00:00:41.290
I'll send you
the specification document.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.910
And that document will include
my thoughts on the feature and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.350
how exactly the feature works.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.620
Also a couple of implementation
tips that I can think of.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.510
I've written one for the detail screen
interaction that I'm looking for.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.410
Care to take a look?
