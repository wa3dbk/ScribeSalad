00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.260
Well, that's it. You've completed Udacity's Introduction to Data Science

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.220
course. I really hope that you've enjoyed it, and you've learned

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.090
a lot. Having taken this course, you should now be familiar

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.340
with a lot of the tools and techniques that data scientists

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.380
are using on a daily basis. You've also completed an

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.250
entire analysis project investigating ridership on the New York City subway

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.480
system. And you can share that with your friends or your

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.640
family. If you find yourself still interested to learn more about

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.020
data science, I'd highly recommend you take some of the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.790
data science courses being offered by Udacity. They cover all of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.840
the topics that we've discussed in this course at a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.280
much higher level of depth. If nothing else, I hope that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.570
you've learned that data science isn't just something being used

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.860
in Silicon Valley. More and more, data science is being used

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.190
to solve problems of all different types in industries all over

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.220
the world. Well, so long, and thanks for taking the course.
