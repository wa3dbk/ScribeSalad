00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right. With this I'd like to finish this class.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I just want to tell you what you've learned, because you did amazingly well.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You learned about localization.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You wrote an algorithm that implements what's called Markov localization.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You learned about probabilities, Bayes Rule, and total probability.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You implemented all of this, and you solved interesting quiz questions.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is an enormous amount of work.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You are now able to make a robot localize,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but you also have a very intuitive understanding of some very interesting

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and important probabilistic methods that are commonly called "filters."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Next class, we're going to see new filters,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and particularly, we're going to talk about particle filters and Kalman filters.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We will apply both of those to really interesting problems in the Google self-driving car,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In particular, to the problem of finding and predicting other cars.

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I'll see you in the next class.
