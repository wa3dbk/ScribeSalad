00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.230
In order to get the most
out of this course,

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.830
you should have a good grasp
of Python programming.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.610
If you are comfortable making and
using functions, classes,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.920
dictionaries and understand the basics
of properties, decorators and

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.710
lambda functions,
you're in good shape for this course.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.330
A few links for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.640
brushing up on these topics
are available in the instructor notes.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.190
We will be using the Flask
web development framework.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.860
And SQLAlchemy extensively
in this course.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.960
If you're not familiar with the basics
of Flask, please check out the official

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.380
Flask documentation or
Udacity's full stack Foundations course.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.490
Links to both of these can also
be found in the instructor notes.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.390
An understanding of OAuth 2
flows will also be very helpful

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.910
when it comes to securing our web API.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.130
I highly recommend completing Udacity's
authentication authorization course, or

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.400
reading through some of Google's Oauth
2 documentation before attempting this

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.020
portion of the course.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.430
I highly recommend using a Vagrant
environment for this course.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.260
Vagrant will allow you to work in a
virtual machine with a shared folder you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.360
can access on your host computer.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.280
This way, if anything accidentally
gets messed up in the vagrant machine,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.379
it won't affect your host machine.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.505
A link to downloading and
installing a Vagrant machine,

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.600
pre-installed with all
the necessary libraries for

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.440
this course, can also be found
in the instructor notes.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.380
We will be delving into the Google and
FourSquare documentation, and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.970
playing with their APIs
later in this course.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.480
You will need developer accounts for
both of these applications,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.840
which can be created free of charge.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.740
Links for creating these accounts,
if you do not previously have them,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.200
can be found in
the instructor notes as well.
