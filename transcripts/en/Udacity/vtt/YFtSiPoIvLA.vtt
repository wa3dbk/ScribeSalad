00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.670
So we know a game icon should give
people an idea of your game content.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.920
But screenshots let you
show them in detail.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.940
The best screenshots show what's
unique and fun about your game.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.880
Here are some good screenshots
from the game Temple Run.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.790
The very first image is of the main
character running away from something

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.440
into a temple.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.780
It shows all the main aspects of
the game, a character who runs and

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.550
collects coins, with a clean visual.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.340
The second image emphasizes a detail,
the coins that we saw in the first

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.890
image, and the text hopefully
explains what they do.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.210
And the third screenshot
shows a special feature.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.440
And you'll notice that all of
these images have some text that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.240
helps describe the images.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.880
In general you'll want to
communicate visually, but

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.300
it's okay to have some supporting text
that doesn't take away from the image.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.180
After someone looks
at your screen shots,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.690
if they're still on the fence,
they'll read your game description.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.050
The description should be clear and
short and

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.520
talk about your game's main features.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.310
For example, Temple Run's description
gives a bit of back story

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.500
about the player running away from
demon monkeys and collecting coins, and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.720
then goes on to describe how to
play the game with swipes and taps.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.350
It describes the gameplay,
goals, and obstacles.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.360
So use your screenshots and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.090
description wisely to describe gameplay,
goals, and obstacles.
