Here is a scatter plot, and now we can easily see a trend going like this. As x

00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:11.874
increases, y tends to decrease. The data don't fall exactly on a straight line

00:00:11.874 --> 00:00:16.535
but they definitely follow a clear linear trend. There is a line that best

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:20.820
approximate this data and we are going to talk about that in the next lesson.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.284
Data doesn't just ahve to follow a linear path. It can also follow a curved

00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:31.006
linear path, like this. In this lesson we're just going to focus on linear

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:36.612
trends. Intuitively we know that certain variables have a relationship. As I

00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:41.730
said before, height and weight or age and height tend to have a relationship.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.490
So now let's focus on which variables have a stronger relationship.
