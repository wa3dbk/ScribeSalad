00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:04.030
Although the trap-and-emulate model
seems like it will solve all problems

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.240
and it worked beautifully on the
mainframes, when in the 90s, the need to

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.940
reapply virtualization solutions to
the prevalent x86 architecture came up,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.130
it turned out that there were
certain problems with this model.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.370
At the time,
x86 platforms had just the 4 rings.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.070
There wasn't any support for
root or non-root mode.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.479
And so the way to virtualize them would
be to run the hypervisor in ring 0 and

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.130
the guest OS in ring 1.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.540
However, it turned out that there
were exactly 17 instructions,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.040
that were privileged in that
hardware would not allow them to be

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.190
executed if they're not issued
from the most privileged ring 0.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.480
However, they did not cause a trap.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.620
Issuing them from another protection
level from ring 1 or above

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.450
wouldn't pass control to the hypervisor
and instead would just fail silently.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.720
For instance enabling or disabling
interrupts requires manipulating of

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.450
a bit in a privileged flags register and

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.670
this can be done via
the POPF/PUSHF instructions.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.480
However, when these instructions
are issued from ring1 in

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.080
the Pre 2005 architecture,
they just fail and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.700
the instructions pipeline is allowed
to continue to the next instruction.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.760
The problem with the situation
that there is no trap is that

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.440
since control isn't
passed to the hypervisor,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.970
the hypervisor has no idea that the OS
wanted to change the interrupt status.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.680
So, the hypervisor will not do anything
to change these settings, will not

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.070
emulate the behavior that was required,
that was intended with this instruction.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.700
At the same time because the failure
of the instruction was silent,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.160
the operating system, the guest OS,
doesn't know that anything wrong

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.250
happened, so
the OS will continue its execution,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.450
assuming that correctly the interrupts
were enabled or disabled as intend.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.330
So the OS will then go ahead and
perform operations that, for instance,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.650
if interrupted can leave it in
corrupt or in deadlock state.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.650
Which was intended to be avoided by

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.470
some manipulation of this flags
register to disable interrupt.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.080
So clearly this is a major problem and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.780
makes this trap-and-emulate approach
not applicable for these architectures.
