00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.602
Vertical assymptotes occur when the denominator is 0. This means you have to

00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:09.665
solve x squared minus 7x plus 12 equals 0. So, we can factor this to x minus 4

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:14.390
and x minus 3 equals 0, which gives us the vertical asymptotes of x equaling 3

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.246
and x equals 4. To see if we have horizontal and oblique or slant asymptotes,

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:23.606
we need to look at the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and the

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:29.000
denominator. As the numerator is just one, it has a lower degree than the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.942
denominator, which means that we have a horizontal asymptote. So, what is this

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:39.845
asymptote? The horizontal asymptote tells me roughly where the graph will go

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:44.774
when x is really, really big. And we can see that in this case, when the x gets

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:50.750
bigger, that the function will move closer and closer to 0. So, the asymptote

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.993
is y equals 0. And for e, we have no slant or oblique asymptote.
