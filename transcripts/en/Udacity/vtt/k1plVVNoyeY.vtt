00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.195
The degrees of freedom are 4 plus 3 minus 2, which is 5. Alternatively, we can

00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:12.121
just add the degrees of freedom of each. 3 plus 2, and then we find that our

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:19.342
t-critical value is positive and negative 2.571. This t-statistic, -1.34, is

00:00:19.342 --> 00:00:25.404
not in the critical region defined by these critical values. Therefore we'll

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:26.419
accept the null.
