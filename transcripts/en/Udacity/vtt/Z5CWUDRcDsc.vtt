00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.070
Layout is happening at 980 pixels wide and then just

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.720
getting rescaled to fit the screen. If we rotate the screen

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.280
it's scaling it up to fit the width, so in

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.660
short this isn't a fluid layout at all. It's a fixed

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.690
width with the font size being set in pixels and

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.310
then getting scaled along with everything else. The worst part of

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.750
this, is that I'm going to have to zoom in to

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.210
read this text. It's far too small for me to read.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.150
And in fact, when it's all the way across

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.270
the screen, it's still a little small to read.
