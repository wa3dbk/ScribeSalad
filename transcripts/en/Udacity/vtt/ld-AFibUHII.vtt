00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.310
&gt;From a purely informatics perspective,
many aspects of public health

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.470
are similar to population health in
that data is aggregated and reported.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.380
However, public health takes a broader
view of the factors determining health

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.650
and disease.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.290
To do this, as shown here,
it uses disparate data sources

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.430
to understand the impact of many
factors and determinants of health and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970
disease including the social, physical,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.940
environment, genetics and
even governmental policies and programs.
