00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.290
Now we'll show you where Docker
really shines, by showing how

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.860
easy it is to get multiple versions
of nginx running using it.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.978
This is where Docker adds some value.

00:00:08.978 --> 00:00:11.659
It allows us to run
self-contained applications

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:16.672
that have their own versions, packaging
that includes their own dependencies.

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:19.010
So two versions need
different dependencies,

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.979
Docker allows us to do that by
bundling up these two containers.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.919
Plus Docker abstracts away
the underlying OS package managers if

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.998
they may had been to learn the RPM
on Red Hat and apt-get on Debian.

00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:35.630
We can just learn the Docker CLI.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.808
Let's get started by installing Docker.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:44.470
Now that we have Docker installed,
we are ready to work with Docker images.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.940
You can see we don't currently have
any images installed on our system.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.140
So let's go ahead and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.500
get the same virgin nginx we installed
through our package manager.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.640
This takes some time to download
the image from a repository

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.280
because we're pulling in nginx and
all of its dependencies.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.810
So that the image can be self-contained.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.380
We'll talk more about repositories
in the future, but for

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.869
now let's focus on images.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.650
Now if we run the Docker images command,
you can see that we have nginx image.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.350
And you can verify this is the same
version of nginx we installed

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.512
using the native OS package manager
