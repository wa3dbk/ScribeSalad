00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.648
Alright.

00:00:00.654 --> 00:00:05.137
Let's look at some exponent patterns now, to figure out what goes on with other

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.481
types of exponents. We've seen them increase. Well, what happens when they

00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:14.063
decrease? Okay. Here, I have 3 cubed, which is really just 3 times 3 times 3, or

00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:18.594
27. Here, I have 3 squared, which is 3 times 3, or 9. And then here, I just have

00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:23.080
3. Based on this pattern, what do you think 3 to the 0 would equal? Think about

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:26.915
what's happening to our answer as we go down. You can put your answer in this

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:27.350
box here.
