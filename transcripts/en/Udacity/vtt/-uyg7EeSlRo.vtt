00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.444
To solve this equation, we want to undo the division by 2. We want to clear the

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:08.926
fraction, so we multiply by 2. Notice this is one whole fraction. I can reduce

00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:13.358
the 2's that appear in the numerator and the denominator. I'm left with 3 times

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.752
the quantity a minus 7. Now, we want to clear the grouping so we can distribute

00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:22.547
this positive 3 to each term. 3 times a is 3 a, and 3 times negative 7 is

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:27.999
negative 21. Adding 21 to both sides, we get 3 a equals negative 15. So, for the

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:33.638
solution, a is equal to negative 5. Remember, just like all the other equations,

00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:39.194
we can check our answer. I can plug in negative 5 for a, and this result should

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:44.280
be negative 18. Negative 5 minus 7 is negative 12, 3 times negative 12 is

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:50.041
negative 36. And at negative 36 divided by 2 is negative 18. So our answer, a

00:00:50.053 --> 00:00:52.216
equals negative 5, does check.
