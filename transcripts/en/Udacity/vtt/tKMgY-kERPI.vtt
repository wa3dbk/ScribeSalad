00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's the answer. We can define sum3.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're going to use the procedure definition syntax.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we have the def, followed by the name sum3, and now we need to find our parameters.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Since there are 3 inputs, we need 3 names.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We can make up the names whatever we want.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm just going to use a, b, and c.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Using letters like a, b, and c for inputs is usually not a good idea.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
They don't tell us a lot about what they're supposed to mean.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In this case, since the inputs are just 3 numbers, and they don't mean anything special,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.785
we don't have any different meaning for the 3 numbers.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:37.000
Using a, b, and c is sort of sensible.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But for most procedures, we want to use names that gives us a good idea

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of what the inputs are supposed to mean.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now we have our 3 inputs.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We can produce the output right away just by adding those 3 numbers.
