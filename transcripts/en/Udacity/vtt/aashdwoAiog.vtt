00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.830
Welcome back. We started the discussion of the distributive

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.390
systems with definitions and principles. We then saw how

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.860
object technology, with its innate concepts of inheritance and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.200
reuse, helps in structuring distributive services at different levels.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.510
In this next lesson module, we will discuss the design and implementation of

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:33.290
some select distributed system services. Technological innovation come when one

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.810
looks beyond the obvious and immediate horizon. Often this happens in academia,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.950
because academicians are not bound by market pressures or compliance to existing

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.950
product lines. You'll see this out of the box thinking in the three subsystems

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.400
that we're going to discuss as part

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.470
of this lesson module. Another important point,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.880
often the byproducts of a thought experiment

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.840
may have more lasting impact than the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.920
original vision behind the thought experiment. History

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.050
is ripe with many examples. We will

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.860
not have the ubiquitous yellow sticky note,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.640
but for space exploration. Now close to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.420
home, for this course, Java would not

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.710
have happened but for the failed video-on-demand trials

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.660
of the 90s. In this sense the services we are going to discuss as part of this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.140
lesson module, while interesting in their own right, may themselves be not as

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.998
important as the technololgical insights they offer on how to construct complex

00:01:40.998 --> 00:01:45.638
distributed services. Such technological insights are

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.070
the reusable products of most thought

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.150
experiments. There's a common theme in

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.810
the three distributed subsystems we're going

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.680
to discuss. Memory is a critical,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.310
precious resource. With advances in network technology

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.288
leveraging the idle memory of a peer in a Local Area Network may help overcome

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:11.270
shortage of memory, locally available in a particular

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.410
note. The question is how best to use

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.730
the cluster memory, that is the physical memory of peers, tend to be idle at any

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.600
particular point of time in a local area

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.890
network. Global memory system, GMS, asks the question,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.980
how can we use the peer memory for

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.580
paging across the Local Area Network. And later

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.968
on we will see DSM, which stands for

00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:38.800
distributed shared memory. Asks a question, if shared memory

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.900
makes the life of application programmers simple in

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.190
a multiprocessor, can we try to provide the same

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.120
abstraction in a cluster and make that cluster

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.150
appear like a shared memory machine. And a third

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.240
work that we will see is this distributed file system,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.890
in which we ask the question, can we use the cluster

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.300
memory for cooperative caching of files. Anyhow, back to our first

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.870
part of this three-part lesson module, namely the Global Memory System.
