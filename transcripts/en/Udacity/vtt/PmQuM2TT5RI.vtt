00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.660
So here is a good picture of how
virtualization is related to

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.000
security and isolation and
things like that.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.960
This is your physical hardware.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.130
On top of that, we have this hypervisor.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.060
It's also called a virtual
machine monitor, or VMM.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.652
And on top of that,
we have this different VM.

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:18.637
So, this is VM1.

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:20.739
This is VM2.

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.478
This is VMn let's say if
you have one of n of those.

00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:29.670
If you somehow compromised
this operating system,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.689
it only effects the user
applications we have here.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.096
It does nothing to the user
applications we have running

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.838
in other virtual machines.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:41.796
This is what we're saying,
is your trusted computing base.

00:00:41.796 --> 00:00:43.421
As long as you can trust this,

00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:46.416
the isolation across virtual
machines is going to work.

00:00:46.416 --> 00:00:50.091
So, compromise of this operating system
is not going to affect these other

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:53.057
virtual machines and
the applications running in those.

00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:57.848
For us, virtualization is important
because our focus is in security and

00:00:57.848 --> 00:01:00.951
you see this isolation
of these applications.

00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:03.796
Earlier they all shared
the same operating system.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.840
Now they only share a Hypervisor.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.180
Why might that give you better security?

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.690
We're going to talk about that next.
