00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.480
Do physicians actually prefer EMRs
with innovative approaches to data

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.010
collection?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.790
This 2009 survey from
the American Academy of Family Practice

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.460
suggests the answer is yes.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.770
Here physician choices are analyzed
based on practice size.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.790
The lighter colors are small practices.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.690
The darker colors are larger practices.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.890
It's important to recognize
that smaller practices

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220
tend to independently
make these decisions,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.970
while larger practices tend to have
employed physicians and/or to be

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.710
aligned with a health system that often
makes an enterprise EHR choice for them.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.470
Grouped by practice size, as you can
see, the choices are quite different.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.060
While I don’t want to generalize based
on my own direct observations of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.110
the systems at the top, the physicians
that chose EMRs on their own do,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.200
in fact, pick more innovative or
well-designed solutions for

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.850
data collection like those
we’ve been discussing.
