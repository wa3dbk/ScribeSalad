00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.308
For this first one you have four pieces that are shaded out of sixteen total.

00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:08.132
four sixteenths is the same as 1 4ths. I can think about moving these three

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:12.930
pieces over into this region. I move this one here, this one here and this one

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:17.658
here, I'll get one triangle just like I have over here. This is what it would

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.028
look like. For the circles, I have two out of three circles shaded. So 2 3rds.

00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:27.699
On this side, I have one, two, three, four, five, six pieces shaded, out of

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:33.542
three, six, nine. So I know 2 3rds is the same as 6 9ths. I could also think

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:39.077
about moving this piece over here and moving this piece over here, and I'd have

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.697
two full circles shaded and one circle left empty. It would look like this. Okay

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:49.409
on this one, I know I have two pieces shaded out of six, here I have four pieces

00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:54.539
shaded out of twelve I know two sixths is the same thing as 4 12ths I can think

00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:59.463
about shading this piece and moving it here, this one here and this one here.

00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:05.722
That way I'd have 2 6ths and 4 12ths What's also interesting is that both 2 6ths

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:11.591
and 4 12ths is really 1 out of 3, or 1 3rd, these are all equivalent fractions.

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:17.274
For the last one I have 3 out of 7 pieces and in this last one I have 6 out of

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:22.248
14 pieces. So 3 7ths is the same as 6 14ths. Nice work on that quiz.
