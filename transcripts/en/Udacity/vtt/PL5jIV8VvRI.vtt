00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.110
The answer is that these
two edges don't belong.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.950
All of the other edges are either within
clause edges, which we always include,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.610
or they connect contradictory literals,
a and a bar, b and b bar, etc.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.160
These two edges connect
literals that are the same, and

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.850
we don't want to include these edges for

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.430
reasons that become clear with
an understanding of the proof.
