00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.670
It's important to note that the research
you conduct with your prototype

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.980
doesn't have to be complicated,
but it does have to be effective.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.070
To be effective,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.580
your research needs to answer whatever
questions you ask at the beginning.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.100
This was a great insight shared by Tomer
Sharon in the product design course.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.460
So what questions are those?

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.530
The stage or fidelity your prototype is
in will determine the type of feedback

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.730
you ask for and
the type of questions you ask.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.050
First, it's easier to get good
information from qualitative questions

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.450
rather than quantitative questions.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.430
For example, if you're presenting
a low fidelity prototype,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.620
you're probably just going to want
to ask very high level questions,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.530
such as, can a user easily learn and
use this app?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.275
However, if you're presenting
a prototype that includes

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:49.800
microinteractions and is reflective of
the finished product, you'll probably

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.480
want to ask questions such as,
how does this animation feel to you?

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.080
Do the interactions get in the way of or
improve the experience?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.190
Your goals are entirely different at
that stage since you're moving to more

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.680
of a finished product.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.040
I've put a list of useful
questions to ask and answer for

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.380
each kind of prototype in
the instruction notes below the video.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530
These questions will get you feedback.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.310
Valuable feedback is any
feedback that combines a specific

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.430
part of the prototype.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.780
With a positive or negative
feeling on the part of the user.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.580
For instance,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.890
a user reporting that they are confused
by the menu is very valuable feedback,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.650
as is a user being excited at how
quickly they can achieve their goal.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.065
Specific suggestions can be helpful
feedback, but are often not useful until

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:33.240
you're working on very
high fidelity prototypes.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.330
When you're first
recording users' feedback,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.520
make sure to keep all
of it that you can.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.110
We'll talk later on about how
to go about doing this, and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.690
about what permission you
need from your users.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.280
At the end of the lesson,
you'll be looking for

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.860
patterns in the feedback from
various users on the same prototype.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.370
So detailed records are vital.
