00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.420
There are many ways of doing this, here is one that I think is fairly simple.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.031
Let's look at the inner loop first. So we want to go through all of the cars

00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:12.605
and drive them. And we want to keep doing that until all of the cars have

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:17.362
reached their destination and that's the challenging part. All of the cars

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:21.390
started at location zero and then they moved to location one. And now maybe

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.530
this one here doesn't need to go any further. And I need to, have to have some

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.974
way of stopping this car from moving. So what I'm simply going to do is I'm

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:34.036
going to remove him from the list of cars. So that's the part here. If this car

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:37.815
has arrived, then I'll just remove that car. And remember, when I remove an

00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:42.100
element from the array list, then I don't reccomend the index. But I do it over

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.680
here. And I keep doing that while I have cars to drive.
