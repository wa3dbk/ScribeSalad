00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Another key component of understanding customers

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is understanding customer gains, which is a fancy way for saying

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
what are the benefits that customers expect,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or desires, so besides the jobs they want to get done

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
what do they want to gain by using your product or service?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's take a look.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Some of the gains could be what would make them happy?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Is it saving money, saving effort, saving time,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and what do they expect, and what would go beyond their expectations?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
How would you delight these customers?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Is it quality, more of something, less of something?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And is it features that would delight them or performance or quality?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And what would make your customer's job or life easier?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
More services, lower cost of ownership, flatter learning curve?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Obviously this depends whether you're selling to business customers

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or consumer customers, but you want to be able to make a list or a column

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of all the gains that they would get by using your product.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And some more gains could be is it social consequences?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Does it make them look good, increase in power?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Is it good design? Is it specific or more features?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And how do they measure success and failure?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Is it performance or cost?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And what would increase their likelihood of adopting your product

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
or using it or using your solution?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Again, is it about cost?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Is it about lower risk? Is it about better quality?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Is it because it's more fun?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You need to come up with a series of hypotheses.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Just make that list now.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But you can't guess forever.

00:01:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You have to validate these hypotheses.
