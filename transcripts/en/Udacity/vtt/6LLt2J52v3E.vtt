00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.460
Let us talk about what is design. Design in journal takes us input some sort

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.390
of needs, so goals or functions. It gives us output that's specification of

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.910
this structure of some artifact that satisfies those needs and goals and

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.150
functions. Note that the artifact need not be a physical product.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.690
It can be a process. A program, a policy. Some example for

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.660
design, design a robot that can walk on water.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.270
Design a search engine that can return the most relevant answer to a query.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.270
The Federal Reserve Bank designs and monitor the policy to optimize the economy.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.555
Note the design is very wide ranging, open ended and

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:44.940
ill-defined. In problem solving, typically the problem remains fixed, even

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.350
as the solution evolves. In design, both the problem and the solution co-evolve.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.390
The problem evolves as the solution evolves. We are studying design and

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.560
AI because we are working with AI agents that can do design.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.900
At least potentially, we want AI agents that can design other AI agents.
