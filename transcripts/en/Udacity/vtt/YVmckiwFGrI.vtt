00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
So for a given function, we've learned that the domain of that function, is the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.668
set of all allowable inputs, the set of all of the values of the independent

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:15.820
variable that we can plug into our function to come up with a value. But if we

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.510
were to talk about the allowable input so much, it's also probably important for

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.220
us to learn about the possible outputs, the values that the function can equal.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.276
The set of all possible outputs of a function is called its range. And how might

00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:34.286
you find the range? Well, we can figure out what the range is by plugging in all

00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:38.293
the different values of the independent variable that are in the domain. Once

00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:42.705
we've covered all of those, we will have covered all of the values in the range.

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:46.995
So, the domain then is associated with the independent variable, like x in this

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:51.788
case and in many other cases. And the range is associated with dependent

00:00:51.788 --> 00:00:56.252
variables like f of x. For each of these different variables, the domain and the

00:00:56.252 --> 00:01:00.309
range basically state what values the corresponding variables can take on. So,

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.340
considering this definition of the range, what do you think the range of this

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.654
function is? Remember, this is just the set of all the different values for the

00:01:08.654 --> 00:01:13.150
function, all the different vertical coordinates expand in this graph itself.
