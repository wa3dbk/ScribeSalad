00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.672
Here is the first question, I just copied it from a previous program. Here's

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:07.020
the second question. Notice the first one is a, plain old question, the second

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.490
one is a choice question. I'm passing both of them to the presentQuestion

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.305
method. That's just one of those methods, it's down here, and its parameter has

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.712
type Question. So it's okay to pass a choice question into a question

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:24.410
parameter. You can always convert from the subclass to the super class.
