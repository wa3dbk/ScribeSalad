00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the right answer is (n log n). Why is that?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So here's the n = 4 hypercubed square

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and recall that the bit patterns have 2 bits in them,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and, in general, the number of bits in the label

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of a node and then hypercubed with n edges is log n--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
log base 2 of n, specifically.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So that means the degree of each node,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
in this particular graph--it's 2--but, in general, the degree is log n.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So that means each of the nodes in the graph

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
has log n edges coming out of it,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so we can think of n times the log of n as the number of edges,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but we have to be careful, because we double counted again.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This node is connected to this one,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but this one is also connected back to this one by the same bit pattern.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Exact answer is 1/2 n log n, but that's okay.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In Bit Theta land, we can ignore the 1/2,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we have Bit Theta and then log n.
