00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer is, in the game of pig the opponent

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is trying to defeat "me," so they want the worst for "me."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The dice has no intentionality.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Everything is equal in terms of outcome for the dice,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so that works out to average.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So now we have a way of describing the world.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When we start out, it's "me" and I have options I can take--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
roll or hold--and I go in one direction and I get to a point

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
where it's the dice's turn to roll, and that can have six outcomes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Rather than trying to choose the best, we'll just average over all of them.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's say there's one here, and now it's my opponents turn to move

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and my opponent makes a choice, and let's say ends up here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I look at all these paths through that keep on going

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
until they get to the end of the game.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And then if I say, if I always choose the best,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and if my opponent always chooses the worst for "me,"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and if the dice average out, then I can describe all the paths

00:01:03.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to the end, and I can describe the value of those paths.
