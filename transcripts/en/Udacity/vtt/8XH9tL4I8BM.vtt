00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.520
Probably the most important consideration in cache design is the

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.440
trade off between speed and capacity. To help understand the impact

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.940
of this trade off, I'd like to visualize requests from the

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.390
CPU to Main Memory like this, where the orange lines represent

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.260
the requests to the CPU. We would like the cache hit

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.250
rate to be high and the speed to be fast. These

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.880
goals, however, are somewhat contradictory. We can have a small but

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.710
fast cache and just accept that this would have a low

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.600
hit rate, being only able to intercept quickly a few of

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.200
the requests from the CPU. Or we could have a large

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.230
cache, but this would be slow there. Either because the physical

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.610
limitations like the speed of light, or because of the high cost

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.450
of fast hardware. So we intercept more requests from the CPU.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.050
But, we aren't able to return them as quickly. What is

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.740
the right trade off? Well, it's hard to say. But, fortunately

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.800
we don't have to make just one choice. We can trade off

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.320
side versus speed multiple times at various levels within

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.410
something called the cache hierarchy. What is not in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.500
the CPU registers, we look for in an L1

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.450
cache. What's not in an L1 cache, we look

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.576
in the L2 cache. A multicore processors, there might

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:10.420
be even a third level of cache. What's not

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.940
there, finally we look for in main memory. Even

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.800
main memory, however, we can think of as a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.050
cache for what is on disk. Or we can also think

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.350
about maybe main memory as a cache for what's on the file

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.330
system. Notice here that the top is smaller, faster and costlier

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.360
per byte. And as we go down the hierarchy, we get things

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.370
that are bigger, slower and cheaper per byte. And if we

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.320
do a good job of keeping the data that we're going to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
access next in the higher levels of the hierarchy. That is, if

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.830
we can keep our hit rates high, then making at the speed

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.940
of the top part of the pyramid that has the capacity in

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.760
the overall cost per byte of the lower end of the pyramid.
