Okay, the answer, of course, is HTML is rendered by

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.110
the browser. Let's go ahead and see that in practice.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.440
When I click add here, pizza gets added very largely

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.710
to our shopping list, of course this is probably not what

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.275
we intended, and we can even put better HTML in

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:19.200
here. Potatoes, the marquee tag is always fun for this

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.954
sort of thing. And as you can see, we have

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:25.240
now totally screwed up our shopping list. Now we discussed this

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.910
in the previous lesson. This is because we did not

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.060
escape our HTML when we displayed it allowing the user to

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.450
enter raw HTML into the page. Now, let's see what,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.994
how this happened in practice. When we actually rendered our list,

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:40.640
we're just sticking the raw HTML directly into the page,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.140
allowing the user to put arbitrary HTML into our page. And

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.720
in this particular case, it's somewhat amusing. But if they had

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.480
inserted javascript into our page, which, to be fair, modern browsers

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.030
don't allow you do it anymore. They could actually do some

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.620
really nasty things, like, steal my authentication cookies and send it back

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.000
home. Which is a common way of breaking into websites that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.940
I may or may not done a lot of in my youth.
