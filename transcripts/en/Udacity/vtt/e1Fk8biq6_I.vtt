00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.121
So here are the graphs that match up with each of the functions. You might

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:07.055
notice that two of these graphs actually didn't change at all. From the way

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:10.712
they looked when their corresponding functions didn't have absolute value signs

00:00:10.712 --> 00:00:15.240
in them. Those two graphs are B and C. So what does this mean? Well, you'll

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.790
note that in both functions g and k, the absolute value signs appeared around x

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.440
squares. Now we know that x squared on it's own is always going to be positive.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.512
So taking the absolute value sign of a positive number doesn't do anything to

00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:32.530
change it's value. That's why these two graphs don't change at all, compared to

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.183
the old versions. We put absolut value signs around the denominatro of the

00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:40.940
function 1 over x. We can see that the branch that used to be down here with

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.213
negative x and negative y values. Got flipped across the x axis. So now, it's y

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:49.650
values are positive. I think that graph d might actually be the most

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.360
interesting change of these four. Before, we just had a straight line. This is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.760
basically just the function. F of x equals 1. A constant function. But now, our

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.226
numerator will always be positive. But, once we move over into the negative x

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:06.311
values. The denominator will be negative. A positive divided by a negative

00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:09.703
makes a negative, which is why this half of the line got reflected across the x

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:13.699
axis to become negative. Pretty cool.
