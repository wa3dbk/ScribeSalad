00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.850
When you save an entity with a key, it creates a new

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.990
entity in the data store with that key. As you found out

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.680
earlier, this creates a key conflict. If an entity with that key

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.760
already exists, it is out of luck and it gets chucked out.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.900
It's overwritten in the data store. So if you want to update

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.680
an existing entity, first you need to get it out of the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.570
data store, then you make your updates and then you save it

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.410
back into the data store again. So back here in the save profile

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.660
method of that conference API, whenever we've been saving our

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.170
profile the first thing we do is create a new

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.210
profile with the user ID. That means that actually every

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.812
time you update your profile, you're not really updating it,

00:00:37.812 --> 00:00:41.250
you'll create a new profile entity which overrides the existing

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.170
profile entity. You can see how that plays out in

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.620
the API Explorer. Now that we've implemented get profile, we

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.730
can just call get profile to get the existing profile

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.840
for the current user. So let's do that. Okay. let's see, so my display name

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.750
is "Chocolate Cake" and my t-shirt size is XL. Now, let's say I want to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.665
change that, I want to change my t-shirt size, so I go to

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:10.605
saveProfile and the only thing I want to do is to change my

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:16.180
t-shirt size from XL to XS, extra small, this time.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.810
Now we'll execute. And what would be really nice,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.020
would be that the only thing that changes it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.804
the t-shirt size. So let's see if it will

00:01:23.804 --> 00:01:27.410
happen. But, no, that's not what happens. You see

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.720
how the display name gets set back to the

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.890
default, which is example and my t-shirt size did

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.120
change. What should really happen, the saveProfile method should

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.180
get the existing profile and only update the fields that

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.550
have changed. So that's going to be your next task.
