00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Thrun] So in this next assignment, I'd like you to fix certain data points.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Just as much as you fixed the data points originally in our path,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the beginning and end point, now I want to fix you 4 points.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These are the corner points in our data points.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In our original data, it's the one over here, the one over here,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and I want those to be fixed so they can't move.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the way I indicated this in the code is by giving you a fix array that looks like this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where each of these numbers corresponds to exactly 1 data point.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There's as many elements in fix as there is in path.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And then when I call smooth, I add fix as a parameter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So when you change the procedure and run it,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I can tell you you should be surprised by the output

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in that when I run my procedure it copies over the initial path into the output.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We'll talk about this in a second, but please go ahead and change your procedure

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so that your output ends up to be giving you something very much like this.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The modification is simple.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
As I go through my data points, I only apply the update if it's not fixed.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So if the fix flag is not set, they go in here.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is all indented one compared to before.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's a single line change.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let me tell you why this doesn't work.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Consider a few data points like these.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If you fix this data point over here,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
then this guy is perfectly happy with his 2 neighbors--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
this is a smooth path--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and so is this guy over here.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The only data point that's unhappy is the one over here

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
because it's not part of a very smooth path,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but this one is never being updated.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So as a result, all the other ones stay where they are.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
They already have the absolute minimum for smoothness and for the data fit.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
No updates take change, and we don't have the desired result.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We don't get a nice round curve the way we wish to get it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
To get this, we are going to modify our rule a little bit now, and that's the interesting part.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
For a node like this with coordinates xi and yi,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we add to it with a very small constant gamma--

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in fact, it will be half our weight smoothing constant in a minute--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
2 times the previous guy--

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and of course that's cyclic, so you have to make sure this is really cyclic--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
minus the guy 2 steps away and minus our node.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Why this makes sense we see when we go into the opposite direction.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Here we add a small gamma, 2 times this guy over here minus this guy here

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
minus our original data point.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And behind this is a certain desire.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We want the vector over here to be the same as the vector over here.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This vector is this difference over here of xi + 1 over yi + 1 - xi over yi.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
That is this vector over here.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And the vector over here is similarly the difference of the point i + 2

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
minus the same for i + 1.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
If you set these to be equal and bring yi to the right side,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
then if you modify yi in proportion to this expression over here, we reduce the error.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
In fact, the expression in the brackets is the same as this one, called (A),

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
minus this one, called (B).

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So we're looking at the mismatch between these 2 vectors

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and use it to adjust the xi factor over here.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We do those sequentially--this one first, this one second.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
You might call them a little bit sloppy

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
because the first update already inferences the second update. But who cares?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
We're just going to add lines of code that achieve this over here,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and when you do this, please make sure that your update

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
understands the fact that these indices are cyclic.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So I did this in my code and I'm running it,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and out come the following numbers that you can read over here.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
These numbers are indeed a cycle.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So if we were to plot them--and this is the original data--

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
these are the points we would constant,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
then the new data lies in over very much like this. You can plot them.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Unfortunately, I can't plot them in our environment here, but you could see this.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Now we are not shifting the racetrack inbound anymore.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Please go to your code and modify the function smooth by doing these new constraints.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
For the update strength, I suggest you use half of weight_smooth for each update.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So in total, you add another 0.1 as update strength.
