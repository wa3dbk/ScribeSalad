00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's get started.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Taking a look down here at the bottom, one of the first things we print

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
out is funone x is Hong Kong.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The only Hong Kong we ever see in the program

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is the first argument to funone

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so that means that this must be x.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Funone y is outside y,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which means that we can't have overwritten it here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If we put y in this box,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we would mistakenly get out 1997,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and we don't see that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So it can't be x because we just used x; it can't be y,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so let's try z.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If we pass in 1997 as z, then y will still refer to this old value of outside y,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we'll get the printout that we expect.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Then we call funtwo, and down here

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
if we take a look at the printout, x remains unchanged.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
X is still outside x, but y is funone y.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The place we see that is right here, it's the parameter being passed in.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So in order from funone y to the flow here,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
we have to fill in this box with y.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Note that the way scoping works,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
funone and funtwo are independent,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
so even though funone has overwritten x,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
funtwo still sees the old outside value.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Well, let's test this answer and see if it's right.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I will just add a little more information,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and we get exactly the output we were expecting.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Some actual information that Hong Kong is a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
special administrative region in China,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
was controlled by the UK until 1997,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and then down here,

00:01:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
just the output we had hoped to get for this puzzle.
