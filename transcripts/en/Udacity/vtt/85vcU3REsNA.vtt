00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.760
I've opened up Backbone
source code here.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.750
And let's refresh the page so that we
know that we're starting from scratch.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.760
And now let's set up that object again.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.250
We need a break point here so

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.700
that chrome will pause when we
try to call on from the console.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.600
Great, now we can call on
to get the ball rolling.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.180
There will be several function
calls in quick succession.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.960
The important thing to notice
is that new information is being

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.920
passed along with each call.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.430
First, InternalOn is called,
and adds this object.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.530
InternalOn adds an events
property to the object,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.870
which is the result of
the call to Events API.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.960
EventsAPI is called and
passes the on API function.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.550
The existing events,
if there are any, or an empty object.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.820
The event name, the callback,
and some other contextual data.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.850
Let's step into eventsAPI.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.080
EventsAPI checks if
the event name is an object.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.990
A string of multiple space
separated events, or a single name.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.290
Our event is log.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.680
So we end up down here.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.000
The empty list of events, name,
and callback are passed to OnAPI.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.710
When we started by calling
on down here in the console,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.070
everything up to this point has
been verifying information and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.180
adding new things that
are getting passed along.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.210
We finally reach
the bottom of the stack.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.530
Pay attention to what's
going on in this function.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.540
Since this is our first time through,
events name doesn't exist yet so

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.310
an empty array is created.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.120
Both events name and
handlers points to this same array.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.630
We didn't pass any options,
so these are just undefined.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.940
Handlers is the new array
that was just created and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.460
an object containing the callback
function is added to it.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.590
If we look at the current scope, you'll
see that there's an event's object

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.300
with a log property that's
an array of one object.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.080
That object has the callback inside it.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.110
The rest of the process is
returning this events object.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.330
Lastly and most importantly,
remember that this event's object

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.539
is stored as a property
on the original object.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.840
And that's it, so Backbones on method
adds an events object to the object.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.500
Each key is the name of
an event to listen for.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.008
And each value is a list
of callbacks to run
