00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.313
But now we have problem. We got 0 for our average deviation, and that's can't be

00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:10.343
a good measure of how spread out these are. I would think that, if we had the

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:15.655
same data point over and over again that the spread of this would be 0. But here

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:20.821
we have a lot of data points all over the number line and there's got to be some

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:25.960
kind of spread there. So this can't be our measure of spread, if we're going to

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.967
get 0. The problem is that the negatives are cancelling out the positives. When

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:35.900
measuring spread, we don't care if our data values are above or below the mean.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.666
We just care how far they are from the mean. So how can we make sure that the

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:45.796
positive and negative deviations don't cancel each other out? Choose all that

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:50.590
you think could work. Ignore the negative sign, at least for those with negative

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.723
deviations. Multiply each deviation by 2. Square each deviation. In other words,

00:00:55.723 --> 00:01:00.564
multiply each deviation by itself, or is there nothing we can do? But first,

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:05.634
this is very tricky, please think hard about this because measuring spread is

00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:07.969
crucial to statistics. Good luck.
