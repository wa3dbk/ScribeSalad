How about this one? Is this an algorithm? If so what does it do? You'll need a

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.920
little bit more detail. This is a two by eight block and this is a two by two

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.860
block. And I can stick blocks together like this. Is this an algorithm? Yes or

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.487
no? If not, why not? If so, what does it make? An L, an H, a doorway or

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:24.052
something else?
