00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.996
&gt;&gt; The mean is $52,793.80. And if you remember, we did that by adding each of

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:12.303
these up. And since there are 10 values, we divide the sum by 10. To remind you

00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:18.317
of the way we put this in symbols, we summed the first through the tenth, and

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:23.499
then we divided by the number of values, and then we get the mean.
