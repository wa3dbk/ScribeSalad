00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.876
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's take a moment to examine these values of x, the amount we're increasing

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:09.740
each dimension by, and A, the total area of Grant's display space, or at least

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.742
the ones that we've seen so far. The original area, before we added anything to

00:00:14.742 --> 00:00:19.970
either dimension, was 150 square feet. When we added 1 foot in each direction,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.513
the area changed 176 square feet. So in the transition from this point to this

00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:30.584
point, x went up by 1 and A went up by 26. Let's see what happens in the next

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:36.195
transition. Once again, x went up by 1. But this time, A increased by 28 instead

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:41.494
of 26. This is what we call nonlinear behavior. Remember that for a straight

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:46.020
line, which we can write as y equals mx plus b, m, the slope, is going to be the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.795
same, regardless of which points we pick. The change in x is always going to be

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:55.435
the same. The change in x value is always going to have the same proportion to

00:00:55.435 --> 00:01:00.076
change in y value. The change between two x values and the change between two y

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:04.357
values is always going to obey the same ratio. That is not what's happening

00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:08.686
here. This equation no longer applies. A change of 1 foot in dimension doesn't

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:12.787
always increase the area by the same amount. This is a pretty interesting

00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:17.353
problem to have. Remembering that area is equal to length times width, can you

00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:21.826
come up with an equation that we can use to figure out what value of x will give

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:26.708
us an area of 300 square feet? So think about how x will be involved in both the

00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:29.194
length and the width of this new area.
