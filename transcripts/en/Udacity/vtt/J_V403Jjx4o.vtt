00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.719
Okay, we have broken submissions. We can no longer submit

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.110
to ASCII Chan. I submit something, but we're only seeing

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.110
the cached page. So, so here's what happened. What we

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.330
did is, we made a request to ASCII Chan, who

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.390
made a query to the database, which came back with

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.650
a response. And then ASCII Chan Store that result of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.930
that query in a cache. So now I've got all

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.320
of our artwork in our cache, and we use the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.580
data in that cache to send the result back to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.930
the user. Now when we submitted a new piece of art

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.320
to ASCII Chan, we wrote that art to the database, and

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.920
then we redirected the user back to the front page. The

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.630
user then requests to the front page again. At which

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.680
point ASCIIchan said, well, the data's already in the cache. I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.620
don't need to check the database. And, return the value from

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.550
the cache again, straight to the user, without the new value.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.910
This is a problem. It means now, submissions are still

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.790
working. They're going to the database. But because of the new

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.510
cache that we added. All of our requests are bouncing

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.920
off the cache and the cache isn't getting updated which is

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.820
resulting in it appearing as though submissions are broken which

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.030
brings us to our next quiz. How can we fix our

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.520
stale cache problem and stale cache of course refers to

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.670
the fact that our cache is stale. We submitted new content

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.680
to our database and our cache is now out

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.900
of date. That's referred to as having A stale cache.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.710
Should we improve our cache to automatically expire things after

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.520
some time? After we submit, should we just clear the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.390
cache? Or after we submit, should we update the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.730
cache? Or don't cache at all? That's not going to work.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.130
And we should find a different solution. There are multiple

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.200
good answers in here. Check all of them that apply.
