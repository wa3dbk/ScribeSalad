00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.818
Our final answer is negative 19 plus the square root of 77. Nice work if you

00:00:05.818 --> 00:00:09.734
found this answer. Now this one was tough because we will end up distributing a

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:14.960
square root of negative 11 in our problem. Let's see how it's done. First we

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.804
distribute the square root of 7 to 2 root 7 and to 3 root 11. Next we

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:25.403
distribute the negative square root of 11 to 2 root 7 and to 3 root 11... I

00:00:25.403 --> 00:00:28.636
write all these out so that way you don't confuse multiplying numbers and

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:33.552
multiplying radicals. Like for this first term, I have 1 times 2 which equals

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:39.272
2, and root 7 times root 7 which is just 7. For the second term, I'll have 3

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:44.710
times the square root of 77. For a third term, we'll have negative 2 times the

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.329
square root of 77. And finally for our 4th term we'll have negative 3 times 11.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.812
The square root of 11 times the square root of 11 is just 11. We combine these

00:00:56.812 --> 00:01:02.268
two terms since they both have the square root of 77. 3 root 77 minus 2 root 77

00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:08.738
is 1 root 77. We carry out the multiplication and then we'll have 14 minus 33,

00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:14.173
which equals negative 19. We bring down our root to get our final answer.
