Sensation and perception closing points. Humans have five sense organs, eyes,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.014
ears, nose, skin and tongue. These have evolved in humans and all animals to

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:14.542
take in information from the outside world, and to allow the animal to adapt

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:19.785
and respond to an ever-changing world. All sensory information gets translated

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.650
from physical stimulation to neural information in the sense organs. From

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.170
there, they get relayed by neurons to different parts of the brain where that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.137
information is interpreted and made sense of. The senses (sensation) and the

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:36.912
brain (perception and thought) are part of the same process. Responding

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:41.120
adaptively to our environment. It is also important to know and understand that

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.130
our sense organs are limited and so we only take in part of the physical world.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.414
So, we never perceive the world as it is but only how our sense organs sense it

00:00:50.414 --> 00:00:53.453
and our brains perceive it.
