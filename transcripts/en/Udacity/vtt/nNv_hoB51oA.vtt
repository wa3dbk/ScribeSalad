00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.432
Now it's worth putting out that this magical program, Texture Packer, provides a

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:08.689
nice little output option that you can see right here, called trim. What this

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.785
option will do, is that for each image, it'll find out the true boundaries for

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:16.898
it. So let's say an artist gives you a texture but only puts pixels in the

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:21.212
center part of it. The needed pixels of this image only occupy a sub-portion of

00:00:21.212 --> 00:00:25.556
the physical space that's been provided. As such we get a lot of wasted pixels.

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:29.588
Texture packer provides this trim option that will go through and remove

00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:34.076
unneeded and unused pixels, mostly transparent, from all of the sprites that are

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:38.620
given to an atlas. The results are actually pretty significant. You can see that

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.908
the size of the atlas that contains the blank unused pixels is significantly

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:47.372
larger than the one that trims properly. Now it's worth pointing out however,

00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:51.593
that when you use this option the format of the data in your output JSON, from

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.639
Texture Packer is going to change a little bit. So previously the frame

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:00.046
parameters width and height values matched the same as the sort size. So if your

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:04.330
input image was 128 by 128, the size in your texture atlas was going to be 128,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.927
128. And of course the trimmed value is false. Once you start with trimmed equal

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:12.957
to true, you'll notice that the frame width and height represents the true

00:01:12.957 --> 00:01:17.137
boundaries of the used pixels in the input texture. It no longer matches the

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:19.065
size of the input texture exactly.
