00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.630
So we've covered ways to
communicate between machines, but

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.610
how do we format the sets of information
that we want to send and receive?

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.130
This message formatting layer contains
the languages that address this concern.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.820
These protocols focus mainly on the data
structures that contain the information

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.240
we want to communicate,
like the protocols in the other layers.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.990
There are several implementations
already out there, but

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.890
the most two common formats are XML and
JSON.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.320
XML stands for
the extensible markup language.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.740
It looks very similar to HTML and
is readable by humans and machines.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.800
JSON stands for
JavaScript object notation.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.370
It was designed to resemble JavaScript
code, and has attribute value pairs,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.550
making it also very easy
to read from the human eye.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.840
With all these technologies out there,
we've got to do some side-by-side

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.190
comparisons in order to make the choice
that best suits our web application.
