00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.910
As soon as one thinks about letting multiple users access

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.500
a file system, it becomes clear that we will need

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.120
some notion of access rights. Looking at our directory tree

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.780
here again, it should be clear that Alice should not be

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.570
able to see guest's or Bob's file unless they say

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.530
it's okay. And we certainly don't want to let just any

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.050
user access the operating systems files. Ultimately, for each user

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.780
file pair, we need to know what permissions that user has.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.830
That is, which of the basic actions of reading, writing,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.350
and executing the file is he allowed to do? Conceptually, we

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.150
can think of this as a giant matrix with users

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.265
for the columns and files as the rows, for instance. And

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.310
we could store the information that way, but it would

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.922
be pretty inefficient. Think about how many files would have the

00:00:43.922 --> 00:00:48.220
exact same set of values. UNIX like operating systems, achieve efficiency

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.910
by assigning an owner and a group to each file. Here

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.510
I'm displaying this information as the OS command would

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.130
show in the terminal. The owner, or user of the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.020
file, is typically the creator of the file, and the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.760
group might be faculty, or staff, or students or something

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.150
like that in a university setting. We have separate read,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.160
write and execute bits for the owner or user, the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.480
group, and then another set for everybody else. This gives

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.120
us a total of nine bits instead of 3 times

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.660
the number of users on the system. Permissions on directories

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.960
make the system even more complicated. The basic rule is that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.200
reading affects your ability to see what's in the directory. Running

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.390
affects your ability to create, delete and rename files in the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.090
directory. Both of these are intuitive if you think about

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.520
a directory as a file itself, containing the names of the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.380
files and subject directories in it. Execute permissions are a little

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.150
more confusing, as they control whether you can pass through the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.980
directory and access it's contents in ways other than just

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.430
manipulating the file names. For cases where more detailed permissions

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.460
are needed, access control lists are sometimes used on various

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.060
operating systems. These make it possible to create arbitrary row

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.800
values in our permissions matrix by granting permissions to individual

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.880
users or other groups defined in the file system. I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.030
encourage you to explore some more on your own. Some

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.640
good places to start are provided in the instructor notes.
