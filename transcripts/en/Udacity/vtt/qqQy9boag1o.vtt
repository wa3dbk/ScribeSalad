00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.500
When you play a video game, you're
automatically given access to the basic

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.090
content that makes that game what it is.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.790
And if you want more missions,
more quests or character customizations,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.670
then adding downloadable
content is usually an option.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.940
But if that's not enough, maybe there's
an expansion pack that will give you

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.250
the gaming experience you desire.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.850
And why am I telling you this?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.230
Well, in this lesson,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.910
you're going to learn about Ruby Core,
Ruby Standard Library, and RubyGems.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.100
The core API is like
the original video game content.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.950
The standard library is
like downloadable content.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.375
And gems are like expansion packs.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.450
RubyGems are my absolutely
favorite topic in all of Ruby,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.418
because they open up a whole new world
of possibilities in our applications.

00:00:40.418 --> 00:00:43.400
There are RubyGems for
pretty much everything.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.480
Sending emails,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.890
drawing ASCII art, creating web servers,
even telling knock knock jokes.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.190
And by the end of this lesson,
you'll see how to find and

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.970
use RubyGems to improve
functionality in your own code.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.130
All right, let's get started.
