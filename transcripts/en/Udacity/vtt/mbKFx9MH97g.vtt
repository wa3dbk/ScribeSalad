00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.930
If you've ever dabbled
with web development,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.990
then you'll be familiar with
the box model in CSS layouts.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.840
If you haven't, let's take a quick tour.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.470
Now all UI elements in Android
take up a rectangular space

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.240
equal to the minimum rectangle
needed to enclose the object.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.440
We call this the content bounds.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.190
Take this avatar place holder image for
example.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.280
Even though the image is a circle.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.360
It's content bounds are this
enclosing rectangle.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.360
Well, that's not entirely accurate.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.020
The objects bounds also include
any padding, that is, any space

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.080
that is considered to be part of the
object that push its bounds outwards.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.450
So, in our example, the bounds would
be equal to the content's area and

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.650
plus any padding applied to it.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.930
When positioning an element
relative to other elements,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.320
you might also want to leave
some space between them.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.130
This is where we can use margins to
add extra space between objects that

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.630
critically isn't considered
to be part of the element.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.850
So we've seen how both padding and

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.680
margins can be used to add
extra space around an element.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.970
So you might be wondering when
to use one or the other or

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.350
perhaps even a combination of both.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.890
Now the key thing to remember is that
if you want the space to be part of

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.940
the object, then you should use padding.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.240
And if you don't want it to be part of
the object, then you should use margin.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.640
So, when do you want it to be part
of the object becomes the question.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.790
The answer is if you want the touchable
area or the background of the object

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.500
to be enlarged, then use padding,
otherwise use margin.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.320
So in our example, if you want this
avatar to be clickable with a nice,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.430
big touch target.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.790
But we don't want any touch highlight to
extend too far towards the other items.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.193
We could use a combination of padding
around the element to enlarge

00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:43.050
the touch area.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.127
And then margin between the elements
to separate them out without that being

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:48.660
part of the clickable zone.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.892
For those familiar
with the web box model,

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:53.680
notice that there's no
concept of borders.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.940
While you can still apply borders,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.450
these are typically achieved
using background images.
