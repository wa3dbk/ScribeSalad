00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:03.387
I said we didn't need any new constructs, but we are gonna introduce one

00:00:03.387 --> 00:00:07.173
and that's gonna make writing the code we need for a search engine much more convenient

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:10.788
It's also gonna be very useful for lots and lots of procedures that we wanna write

00:00:10.788 --> 00:00:13.637
and the construct we are gonna introduce is called a loop

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:15.722
It's a way to do things over and over again

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:19.105
The kind of loop that we are gonna introduce first is called the while loop

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:20.588
The syntax for the while loop is this

00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:23.822
We have the key word "while", followed by a test expression

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:28.506
followed by a colon, and then inside we have a "block"

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:31.656
and the "block" is a sequence of instructions

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.273
This is very similar to the "if" statement

00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:36.771
So as a reminder, here's what the "if" statement look like

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:40.940
we had an "if" followed by a test expression, followed by a colon

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.107
and then an indented "block", which is a list of statements

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:49.623
that executes whenever the test expression evaluates to a "True" value

00:00:49.623 --> 00:00:55.190
With "if", the block executes either zero or one times, depending on whether the test expression is "True"

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.473
With "while", the block can execute any number of times

00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:03.640
It keeps going as long as the test expression is "True"

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.272
So with the "if " statement, if the test expression is "True"

00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:09.723
we go to the block, run the block and then continue

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:14.523
if the test expression was "False", we go right to the next expression

00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:19.091
With a "while", we also start by checking the test expression

00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.007
if it's "True", we go to the block

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:25.973
But now, instead of going to the next statement, after the block, we go back

00:01:25.973 --> 00:01:29.889
we try the test expression again, if it's "True", we go back to the block

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.856
we always go back to the test expression

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:36.924
if it's "True", we do the block again, we go back to the test expression

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:41.456
If it's "True" again, we do the block again, we go back to the test expression

00:01:41.456 --> 00:01:47.675
and we can keep going around as many times as we need as long as the test expression is "True"

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:52.022
we'll keep executing the block and keep trying the test expression again

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:54.973
At some point, maybe the test expression is "False"

00:01:54.973 --> 00:01:59.056
Once the test expression is "False", we go to the next instruction

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:02.123
So this means a while loop can execute the block

00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:05.424
either zero times if the test expression was "False" at the beginning

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:08.639
one time if it was "True" the first time, but "False" after that

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.073
two times, three times...any number of times, it could keep going forever

00:02:12.073 --> 00:02:16.706
There's no requirement that guarantees the test expression eventually becomes "False"

00:02:16.706 --> 00:02:19.257
So here's an example of while loop.

00:02:19.257 --> 00:02:23.056
We start by initializing variable i, and we'll give it a value, zero

00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:27.939
then we have the "while", the test expression says i is less than ten

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.406
So that means as long as this evaluates to "True", we'll evaluate the block

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:35.806
and what the block does is print i and then add one to i

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:38.040
So here's what happens when this executes

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.391
So initially, the value of i is zero, i is less than ten

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.090
So that means we'll enter the loop

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.655
So that means the test expression is "True", so we'll enter the block, we'll print i

00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:54.540
So we'll see the value zero printed

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.205
and then we'll do the assignment, so that will change the value of i

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:05.205
We add one to i, so that's gonna be making the value of i now refers to one

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:08.956
So if it was an "if", we would be done now, but because it's a "while", we keep going

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:13.790
We go back, test again, if i is less than ten

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.257
Now the value of i is one, which also is less than ten

00:03:17.257 --> 00:03:19.873
so we continue, go to the block again

00:03:19.873 --> 00:03:22.474
we are gonna print i, this time we'll see the value one

00:03:22.474 --> 00:03:27.190
Then we go to the next statement, increase the value of i by one

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.757
that's gonna make the value of i two

00:03:29.757 --> 00:03:33.841
Now i refers to the number two

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:38.807
Because it's a "while", we keep going, we go back to the test expression

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:44.341
i is less than ten, still less than ten, now it's two, we are gonna print the two

00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:49.356
we are gonna add one that it will make the value of i three

00:03:50.756 --> 00:03:51.773
and we are gonna keep going

00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:24.456
Test again, and i is still less than ten, so we are gonna print i again

00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:33.040
we will print the value nine, then we add one, so that's gonna have one to nine, we'll get ten

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.540
So that's the new value of i

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.972
and we go back again

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:48.723
and now we do i is less than ten, and now i has the value ten

00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:54.674
Ten is not less than ten, so that will be "False" and we are done with the while loop

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:57.940
We'll continue with whatever statements here, in this case, there is none

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.190
So then the loopÃ¢Â€Â”Ã¢Â€Â”what we've done, we've gone through it ten times

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.323
we've printed the numbers from zero to nine

00:05:04.323 --> 00:05:10.340
The new value of i will be ten, if we do anything here that uses the value of i

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.240
we'll see that the value of i is ten

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.156
So to see that you understand while loops, we'll have a quiz

00:05:16.156 --> 00:05:18.924
So the question is what does this program do

00:05:18.924 --> 00:05:20.623
Here's the program

00:05:20.623 --> 00:05:24.306
We start by assigning zero to i

00:05:24.306 --> 00:05:32.223
We have a while loop, where the test is not equal to ten

00:05:32.223 --> 00:05:34.207
So the test is i is not equal to ten

00:05:34.207 --> 00:05:40.223
Then we have i equals i plus one, so we are assigning to i the value of i plus one

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:43.056
and then we are printing i

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:46.990
So this is similar to the example, but different in a couple of ways

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.440
So it's up to you to see if you can figure out what the program does

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.656
Try to figure out yourself

00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:54.623
You can certainly also try running this in the Python interpreter

00:05:54.623 --> 00:05:56.240
The choices are

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.424
produce an error

00:05:57.424 --> 00:06:00.356
print out the numbers from zero to nine

00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:03.039
print out the numbers from one to nine

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.055
print out the numbers from one to ten

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:12.189
or the final choice is it runs forever or at least until our machine runs out of power

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.257
So see if you can figure out what it does

00:06:15.257 --> 00:06:16.340
You can definitely try running it

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.000
but try to figure out on your own before running it in the Python interpreter
