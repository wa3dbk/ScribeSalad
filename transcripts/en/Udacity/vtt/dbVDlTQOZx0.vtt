00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is not that easily solved.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What ratio is 12,000 to the total number of students?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, 12,000 over the total number of students ends up being the same as 12 over 144,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that's the same as 1/12.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The correct answer would have been the check box over here.

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This area over here corresponds to the age group of 13 to 19.
