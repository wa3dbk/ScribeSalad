00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.760
Let's specify the behavior
of our enemies.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.880
Each enemy will be associated with
a particular platform, and will

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.200
patrol the top of that platform, turning
around when it reaches one of the ends.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.210
Like that.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.600
The enemies also seem to be floating
on some kind of zero gravity, so

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.799
we'll have them bob up and
down as they move.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.390
Finally, we need to determine how
to make the enemies dangerous.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.740
Now one option would be to have
GigaGal have a health meter, and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.940
then subtract from that health
every time she hits an enemy.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.409
I think it's more interesting though
if instead, every time GigaGal touches

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.810
an enemy she gets flung backwards,
possibly falling to her certain doom.
