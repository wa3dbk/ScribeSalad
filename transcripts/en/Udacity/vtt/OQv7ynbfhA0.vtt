00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.778
To find the number of seconds this is going to take, we need to divide 1.5

00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:09.225
times 10 to the 11th by 3 times 10 to the 8th. Let's use our calculator to do

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:14.007
this. We have 1.5 times 10 to the 11th. You want to divide that by 3 times 10

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:21.190
to the 8th. And look at that. We get 500. 500 seconds is just over 8 minutes.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.820
So when we look at the sun, we're seeing 8 minutes into the past. That's some

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.689
crazy stuff.
