Excellent work if you got all these right. We know for the first one, we have

00:00:04.243 --> 00:00:08.810
three separate terms separated by addition, so that's a trinomial. This second

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.335
expression is a monomial. We have the product of a constant coefficient, 5, and

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:17.673
variables, a cubed, b squared, and c. So just one term. The next expression

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:22.238
contains a square root, so it's not a polynomial at all. It's something else.

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:26.798
Here we have three separate terms separated by addition and subtraction, just

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:30.817
like in the first one. So, it's a trinomial. For 2 m minus 4, I have two

00:00:30.817 --> 00:00:35.456
separate terms, so that's a binomial. Negative 20 is a monomial. And finally,

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:39.400
for this last one, I have a negative exponent on this term, so it must be

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.771
something else. It's not a polynomial.
