00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.798
For this problem, x equals 1 3rd. Excellent problem solving if you found this

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:08.826
fraction. Again, we'll start by multiplying these 2 arguments together, since

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:15.665
we're adding the logs with the same base. So 2x times 3x equals 6x squared. And

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:21.440
2x times positive 5 is positive 10x. The log of base 3 of 4 just stays on the

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.400
right hand side. This means we can set this expression equal to 4. Since we

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.180
have one logarithm of base 3 on one side and another logarithm of base 3 on the

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.639
other. We subtract 4 from each side of the equation to get 6x squared plus 10x

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:45.468
minus 4 equals 0. Now this equation has even coefficients. So I can just divide

00:00:45.468 --> 00:00:51.552
through by a positive 2. Now I can fator this quadratic. Next, we use factoring

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:56.960
by grouping to get the factors of 3x minus 1 and x plus 2. We can set each of

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.525
these factors equal to 0 and then solve for x. So x can equal positive 1 3rd or

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:09.097
x can equal negative 2. When we look back at the original problem, a value of

00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:12.991
negative 2 for x would make this argument negative, and this argument negative

00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:19.020
as well. We can't take a logarithm of a negative number, so this solution is

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.370
out. Our only solution is, x equals one third.
