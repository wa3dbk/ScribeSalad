00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Let's go through it together--for optional arguments,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
there are two possibilities.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The arguments could be: at least one--some real arguments--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or they could be Empty.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The first two lines are going to look a bit like this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We have to call our nonterminal (optargs)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because that's what I called it up here, and it has to match.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm just going to make up this new nonterminal, (args),

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
meaning "one or more".

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If we don't see any of them, we can return the Empty list.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This means there's one or more arguments

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so I'll just pass the buck and assume that (args) is magically

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
going to make, for me, the answer I want.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And I'll just copy it from p[1] into p[0].

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
One of the real tricky parts of handling arguments

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is that they're separated by commas,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
rather than terminated by commas.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So once you have your first argument--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
if you're going to have a second, you need a comma but otherwise, you don't.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This seems a little weird when we say it verbally,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but if you look at it, it's more or less just what we expect.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If there's only one argument,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
then it's just an expression--some number.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But if there are more, then we put commas in between them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So here, for multiple arguments, we have an expression,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a comma, and then any more arguments we like.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And then, finally, we get to the last one,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which is just an expression.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
For this one, we'll just make a Singleton list

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
out of the only argument you gave me.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So this would be the list, containing (1), for this example up here.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And in this other case--myfun(2,3)--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we take this first part--just the (2)--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and we put it in a list by itself,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and then we use (+) to get list concatenation--

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
list.append--to put this single element list

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
together with all of the rest of the arguments we've gathered up.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That's it for defining parsing functions

00:01:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
for function calls and arguments.
