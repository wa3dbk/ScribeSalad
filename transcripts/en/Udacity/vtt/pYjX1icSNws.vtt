00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.300
Let's go ahead and start with the endpoint.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.140
It's simply a Wikipedia URL with a search string put inside.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.330
So far so good.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.660
Then we come to the AJAX request object.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.130
We start off by creating a URL parameter and

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.760
setting it equal to the wikiUrl that we just created.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.900
If we didn't want to pass the URL in as a parameter of this object,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.140
it could actually just be a string by itself that comes before this settings

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.500
object inside this method call.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.960
In other words, we could've passed the URL in here as a string before

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.680
the settings object instead of making it a parameter of the settings object,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.350
but either way works.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.460
Then we set the data type to jsonp, indicating that this a JSONP request, and

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.280
then we have a success function.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.607
I've got a line commented out here for

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:48.190
JSONP as a parameter, setting JSONP to callback.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.620
Some APIs want to use a different name for the callback function.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
By default, using JSONP as a data type

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.660
will set the callback function name to callback.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.840
So this line here's actually redundant.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.450
But if we needed to change it in other words if we

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.379
needed to change this callback right here.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.990
In that case we would use a different string here on the JSONP property.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.470
Check the instructor notes for more on JSONP.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.300
Inside the success parameter we've got this anonymous function which is run when

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.940
we get the response.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.320
Let's take a look at this response in the browser.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.340
Inside the network tab we can see this request for

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.220
Wikipedia, let's click on it, and it looks like we've got a JavaScript object.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.010
Like we said before,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.130
this JavaScript object is going to be wrapped within a function.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.540
So, we can see this long string here as the function.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.220
It looks like we've got a few sections,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.930
including main which has some information.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.680
Inside we finally come to this parameter 1 which has an array of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.320
different articles about San Fransisco.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.270
Now you'll notice here how there are spaces between the words in the response,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.090
but that's okay.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.610
We can actually just use this inside our URLs.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.900
You'll notice that if right-click on one of these and click copy link address

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.050
and then paste it into my browser, we see that the spaces are replaced with %20.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.780
When we press Enter,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.699
we see that Wikipedia's smart enough to redirect us to San Francisco's URL.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.230
So we create this article list variable that we set equal to the array of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.350
articles, remember that parameter one from the object that got

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.740
returned from Wikipedia, which is the response.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.940
And then we simply iterate through it.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.650
Each article gets appended to the page inside a list element using an a tag, and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.490
we simply set the URL to the URL that we create here, and it's article string,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.570
which is the name of the article which we saw in the response.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.380
And with that we've got a pretty awesome page.
