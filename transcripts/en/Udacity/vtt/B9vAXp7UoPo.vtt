00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.840
It turns out that the distance is 13 units. Great solving if you found it. We

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.565
can use the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation. We'll have this leg

00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:16.079
squared plus this leg squared equals our hypotenuse squared. Solving for d,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.100
we'll get d is equal to 13 units.
