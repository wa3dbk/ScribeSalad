00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.020
So why are we focused on a designer, an engineer, and a storyteller?

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.840
Well, we think these roles serve as a great entry point for

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.400
learning about and creating data visualizations.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.014
Some of you may be coming from design backgrounds with a portfolio of projects,

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:18.190
while others of you may have more coding experience and

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.430
can port to software, GitHub, or other websites you've engineered.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.100
And still others may be familiar with writing journals and/or communication.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.080
Whatever your background, we hope to teach you something new in this class and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380
we hope that you get to share your experiences and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.680
your expertise with our udacious learning community.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.980
Now I'm going to hand it off to Jonathan,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.350
who's going to cover data visualization in the context of data science.
