00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
Alright the first one is definitely decidable.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.310
The RAM runs at least 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.960
To do that you just run the program and count how many steps it takes.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.400
If it takes at least 1,000,000 steps then we know that it will take

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.400
at least 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.710
We don't actually need to know whether or not it terminates to answer this question,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.990
we just need to know that it runs at least 1,000,000 steps before that might happen.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.840
The RAM runs at least a million steps and will eventually terminate.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.670
That is not decidable.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.940
The reason for that is in order to answer this question we do need to know

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.140
whether the program eventually terminates, unlike this first question.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.010
In order to answer that we need to answer the general question of whether

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.550
a program will terminate, which we've discussed in the unit is actually undecidable in general.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.550
So this is not decidable.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.900
This final statement is decidable.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.250
It's decidable in much the same way that the first statement is.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.980
The RAM runs at most 1,000,000 steps before terminating.

00:00:55.980 --> 99:59:59.000
Well simply count the number of steps it takes and then answer the question.
