00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.900
So the first possibility, or the first choice, is reusing a local

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.250
implementation. So let's say that the developer has access to a local

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.310
implementation of a class called account. And she then

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.510
takes that class account and derives and extends it to, to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.890
create public methods in the API bank account, and creates

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.700
a bank account implementation. So she started

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.950
with a local implementation of a class account

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.510
and extended it to implement the bank account.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.420
Now this bank account service that has been

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.150
created, she has to make that visible outside,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.030
in the network, so that any client can

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
access it. So this is where she uses

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.920
the built-in class available in the distributed object

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.400
model of Java called the remote Interface.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.430
And what she does is, using that built

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.201
in remote class that's available in the distributed

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.869
object model of Java, she makes the methods

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:09.960
in the bank account class that she created visible on the network. As a result

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.670
of this, so now she's created this interface

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.240
derived from the remote interface she has created,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.990
this interface for her bank account object. And so this interface becomes now

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.390
publicly available for anyone to access. So clients on the network can have

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.800
access to this interface bank account.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.070
Now she instantiates this bank account implementation.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.040
. What happens when the bank

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.760
account implementation is actually instantiated? The location

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.252
of the bank account implementation object, the instantiation that

00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:47.970
she has done, is not visible to the client.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.050
All that is visible to the client is the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.130
interface. The actual location of the object is not something

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.505
that is visible to the client, and therefore the

00:01:55.505 --> 00:02:00.110
implementer has to do the heavy lifting of finding a

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.580
way to make the location of the service visible

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.110
to the clients on the network. So in the first

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.070
choice, all that we used was the built-in class

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.340
and the distributed object model of Java, which is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.600
a remote interface to publish the interface for a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.230
facility that we created. In this case, the bank

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.790
account and the methods in it. And once we

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.950
publish it, that interface is available. Because we derived

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.010
it from the remote interface, the int, the specific

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.330
interface, bank account interface, is available for any client

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.110
on the network. However, when we instantiate the object, the location of the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.630
object where that service is available is not something that is readily visible

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.330
to the client. And so the heavy lifting has to be done by

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.880
the implementer to make that object that

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.390
had been instantiated visible on the network.
