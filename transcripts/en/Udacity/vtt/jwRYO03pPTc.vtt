00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.080
As you may have guessed, the right choice is

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.520
no. The operating system should not be taking precious

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.540
resources away from an application. For example, if I'm

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.510
running a program such as, computing the prime number up

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.260
to a billion, it's going to need a lot of

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.760
resources, CPU cycles in particular, and during that time

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.990
I don't want the operating system stealing cycles away

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.610
from me. So operating system is also a program and

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.570
has to run on the CPU as we saw when we talked about how an operating

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.000
system deals with external interrupts. So it is going to need some resources,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.310
CPU and memory cycles, to do it's work. But a good operating system will take

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.880
the minimal amount of time and minimal amount of resources to do it's thing.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.320
So the right answer is no, as otherwise you will not use an operating system.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.738
It's sort of like when give to a charity.

00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:01.522
The first question you ask is, what percentage

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:05.410
of the collection is used by the charity

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.850
as administrative overhead? You don't want to give to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.080
a charity that spends more than a few

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.330
percentage points of the collections on administrative overhead.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.790
Same thing with an operating system. Most of the time, the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.200
resources, CPU, memory and so on, is being used for running the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.550
applications. The operating system gets in the way as a broker, only

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.920
for arbitrating and providing the resources needed by

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.840
an application safely and securely, and then get's out of the way

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.010
as quickly as possible. So the right answer is no.
