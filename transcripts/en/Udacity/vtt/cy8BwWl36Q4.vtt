00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.197
&gt;&gt; I'm going to show you the answer to this, by doing it in a spreadsheet. You

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:08.949
could do all of these calculations, without any technology. And if you did that,

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:13.362
that's really great. It's always really good practice to calculate things

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:17.709
without using any technology, but just for the purposes of figuring out the

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:22.873
standard deviation, technology can really speed along this process. So I'm not

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:29.985
going to use any shortcuts here. We're going to do it exactly as we would if we

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:38.639
didn't have technology. So first we need to take the avearage of all of these,

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:47.458
we're going to sum them up. So we're taking the sume of all of these. I could

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:55.191
also just write equals a1 plus a2 plus a3 all the way to a10. And we'd get the

00:00:55.191 --> 00:01:02.922
same thing. But why would we do that if we can simply write this. Now to take

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:10.884
the average all we do is divide by the number of values which is 10. So that's

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:18.654
just going to be 51,511.1. Alternatively, the nice thing about technology is we

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:27.070
can just do this. Take the sum, and divide by the total number. Do it all in 1

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.563
step. So now we have the average. Now we're going to subtract the average from

00:01:34.563 --> 00:01:40.776
each 1 of these values. Not the opposite, where we subtract each of these values

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:46.216
from the mean. That's an important distinction. In this case, it doesn't matter

00:01:46.216 --> 00:01:51.481
as much but in other statistical concepts that's an important distinction to

00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:58.227
make. So we'll write equals A1 minus. The mean. So I'm subtracting the mean from

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:05.630
each of these values. Now I could just do the same thing here and write equals

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.044
a2 minus the mean but that would be tedious. We can just drag this down. When

00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:19.621
you do that, remember that there has to be a little plus sign there. That means

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:25.734
you're successfully dragging it down. If you went like this, it won't do

00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:32.486
anything. It'll just highlight the boxes. So here, we have the deviations from

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:39.383
the mean. Here, in the next column We're going to square each deviation. Equals

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:45.394
b1 squared. And again, we're going to drag it down. So we have the squared

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:51.742
deviations for each of these values. Now remember that the variance is the

00:02:51.742 --> 00:02:58.709
average squared deviation. So we could just write. Average of c1 to c10. But I

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.996
want to make sure we go through all the other steps in between. So let's again

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:13.670
practice calculating the average just for clarity's sake. So the variants then

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.829
would be the sum of c1 to c10. Remember that's how you start out taking the

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.637
average, and then divide by 10. So here's the variance, and then the standard

00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:31.793
deviation is simply the square root of the variance. So we'll write equals SQRT.

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:37.695
That's the shortcut for square root. And then we can just see C13. So we know

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:43.730
that the standard deviation is 6557.16 approximately. Now I want to point out

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.998
something really important before we finish this solution video. Here I simply

00:03:49.998 --> 00:03:56.953
said equals square root of this cell C13. Whereas here, I wrote out the

00:03:56.953 --> 00:04:05.325
whole average. The reason for that is because say I had but this all here, A13.

00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:12.849
Then, when we drag it down, we don't get the right deviations. And we can double

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:19.432
click on it, and see what it did. Here, it took A4 minus A16, whereas here it

00:04:19.432 --> 00:04:26.126
took A1 minus A13, which is what we wanted. But we want it to always stay A13,

00:04:26.126 --> 00:04:32.564
which is why we have to make sure this is a constant. And the way to make sure

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:38.507
it's a constant is by just writing it. Notice also that all of these values

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:44.267
changed when these values changed because all these values are dependent of

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:50.507
these values So when we change it back we should again get the correct standard

00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:51.530
deviation.
