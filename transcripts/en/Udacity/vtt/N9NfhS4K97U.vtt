Okay, so here's a quiz.

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:05.458
Like I said, if you have every thread in a CUDA program executing the same program,

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:09.012
you can end up with a lot of parallel launches unless you do something about it.

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:16.693
So what do we need to add to this program in order to make sure only the first thread launches this kernel?

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:20.693
I've given you a hint at the bottom; see if you can figure it out.
