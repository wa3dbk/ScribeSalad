00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.322
Since we no longer have a normal distribution, but a t distribution, we have a

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:09.264
new table. This is called the t table, unlike the z table, the t table tells us

00:00:09.264 --> 00:00:14.850
the critical values in the body. And up here, the column rows are the area in

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.785
the right tail. On the left we have the degrees of freedom. Remember I said

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:25.880
that t distributions are defined by their degrees of freedom. And then on the x

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.750
axis of the t distributions, we have the t values instead of the z values. In

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.594
this case we only really care about the t critical values. So let's say we have

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:41.414
a t distribution and we want to know the t critical value such that. 10% is in

00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:48.680
the tail here, or a proportion of 0.1. And let's say that our sample size is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.430
10, so our degrees of freedom is 9. So this is a t distribution with 9 degrees

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.583
of freedom. And we want to find this t critical value. Well here in the tails,

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:07.360
we look for 0.1. And with 9 degrees of freedom, we see that the t critical

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.170
value is 1.383. You're going to use this t table to do pretty much the exact

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.100
same thing you did with a z table. But instead of finding the z score and then

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.656
determining if that z score is bigger or less than the z critical value. We

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:27.109
find the t statistic and we figure out if the t statistic is greater or less

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:32.963
than the t critical value. Let's practice using the t table.
