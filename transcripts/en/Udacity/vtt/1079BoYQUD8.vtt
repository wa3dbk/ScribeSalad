00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.690
And the answer should look like this. You've got

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.045
your opening em tag, the phrase HTML is reasonably

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:10.290
straightforward, and then the closing em tag. And, our

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.995
b tags are still where we left them. Hopefully

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:16.390
you managed to figure this out that HTML tags

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.640
can be nested just fine and the, the whole

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.230
phrase is in italics because the whole phrase is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.660
surrounded by these tags. And just the words reasonably straightforward

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.900
are in bold because those are just the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.220
words that are surrounded by the b tags. Let's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.820
experiment with that in the editor a little bit

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.318
here. So I'm going to take the closing em tag

00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:41.890
off here and put it on the back. And if we update this, we can see that the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.300
whole phrase learn to love HTML is in italics,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.500
and that's what we just saw on the quiz.
