00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.050
Before we go any further,
I want to show you something

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.840
that every web developer needs to know,
developer tools.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.850
This may seem a bit overwhelming
at first but I promise,

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.650
you'll learn to love them.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.330
I'm going to open up Google Chrome and

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.317
visit one of my favorite websites,
ESPN.com.

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:19.260
Now, I could demonstrate this
using another web browser

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.470
that has developer tools.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.760
But for this demonstration,
I'm going to use Google Chrome.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.544
If I right click this page and select
the inspect option in the drop down,

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:29.478
it opens Google's developer tools.

00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:35.299
Remember how I said it would seem
overwhelming, I wasn't kidding,

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:37.590
there's a ton of stuff here.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.830
To keep this simple, I'm only
going to focus on the elements tab.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.300
But know that the other tabs can
give you a much closer look into how

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.390
a website is built, how it performs,
and what's going on behind the scenes.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.950
Let's try something out.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.560
If you notice, under this elements tab,
we have some HTML.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.550
This is actually the HTML for
the page we're currently viewing.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.330
This is more obvious when I
start hovering over elements

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.740
in HTML because Google Chrome highlights
the corresponding elements on the page.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.430
That's pretty sweet.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.210
And if I click on one of these elements,
then in the bottom right hand corner,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.620
I can see what styles
are being applied to it.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.000
That's even better.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.520
It looks like the element I've
selected's got a lot going on.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.215
Let's try unchecking one of these
properties to see what happens.

00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:22.880
Whoa, did you see that?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.980
The background color of
the navigation just disappeared.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.080
That's because I change the CSS
being applied to this element.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.899
By unchecking the box, I removed the
background color this div normally uses.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.180
Let's try another one.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.270
I'll select one of these articles.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.980
And let's try changing
the background color.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.460
Wow.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.380
Now these articles look like
they're floating on the page.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.220
Each article just runs
up against the next one.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.850
And it's not easy anymore to
tell where one starts and

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.840
where the next one begins.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.870
Now don't worry.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.000
These changes aren't permanent.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.190
And they're only visible
to me on this computer.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.920
If I refresh the page,
everything returns back to normal.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.620
As you can tell,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.980
I could spend all day playing around
with the styling on this page.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.500
But hopefully, what is more obvious
to you is that you see how beneficial

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.080
developer tools can be
to a web developer.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.110
They literally tell us exactly
how the page is built.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.310
You can see both the HTML and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.500
the CSS that is creating the page
that you see in the browser.
