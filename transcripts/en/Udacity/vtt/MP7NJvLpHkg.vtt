00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.700
Here, I think it's easiest to complete the square. And it turns out when we

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.600
solve to complete the square, we get the answers, negative 5 plus or minus root

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.666
22. Great thinking if you got these answers. Keep in mind that you could have

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:16.558
also used the quadratic formula to solve this equation. But since the a here is

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:21.151
one and RB is even, I think it's easiest to complete the square. We subtract 3

00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.543
from both sides, in order to get x squared plus 10x alone on the left-hand side

00:00:24.543 --> 00:00:29.420
of the equation. Now, we can complete our square. We add b over 2 squared to

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.497
both sides, which is 25. Now that we've added 25 to both sides, we can rewrite

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:39.670
the left side as the quantity x plus 5 squared. The right hand side just

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.314
simplifies to 22. We take the square root of both sides of the equation to get

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:49.518
x plus 5 equals positive or negative root 22. Then, to isolate x, we simply

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:52.150
subtract 5 to get our final answers.
