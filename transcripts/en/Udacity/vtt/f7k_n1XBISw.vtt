00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Now, this is how I think about the problem.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.568
Does this phenomenon occur because the process which produces intertweet time is

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:12.593
in fact random, or is it in fact influenced by factors which we have not seen.

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:17.883
If the answer is the former, then the best we can do is our exponential fit

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:23.899
estimator with our guess of 8,585.5 seconds, which we developed above.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:28.634
However, if it's the latter, then we can reduce the inherent variance,

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:33.674
effectively reducing the spread, making intertweet time more predictable by

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:37.230
finding the factors on which intertweet time depends.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.911
To see this, let's look at a simple example.

00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:45.015
But if it's the latter, then we can reduce the inherent variance,

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:49.839
effectively reducing the spread, making intertweet time more predictable by

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.240
finding the factors on which intertweet time depends.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.970
Now, to see this, let's look at a simple example.
