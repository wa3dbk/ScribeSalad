Okay, so what are some possible solutions to users entering bad data in our form?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Should we use dropdowns to limit what the user can actually enter?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Should we assume that the users will only enter good data?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Should we verify what the user enters on the server side and complain if the data is bad?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Or should we just make values up?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Check all that apply.
