Remember that variables are so great and useful because they can take on

00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:09.701
different values. We could substitute in a whole bunch of things for n right

00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:14.521
here, but only one of those numbers would make this entire side of the equation,

00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:19.015
n plus 1 equal to 2. If we pick n equals 7, for example, we'll end up with 7

00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:24.219
plus 1 equals 2. Or, if we simplify, 8 equals 2. But that definetely can't be

00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:28.647
right. Either way, the answer to this question is, the value of n.
