00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.330
When we think about the possible ratios we could obtain, we get the following.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.980
We could take 1 over 1, and that would give us 1. We could also take negative 1

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.971
over 1. And that would give us negative 1. 1 over 4 gives us, well, 1 4th. 1

00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:17.950
over negative 4 gives us negative 1 4th. And you'll notice that if we do

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.325
negative 1 over 4, we get negative 1 4th again. And negative 1 over negative 4

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:26.518
gives us positive 1 4th again. So because we have both a positive and negative

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:29.690
versions of each number in each set of factors, we're going to have a lot of

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.366
overlapping factors. This is convenient, because it means that we'll get less

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.374
in the end than it looks like we would get. The last two possible rational

00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:40.869
zeros are one half and negative one half.
