00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me test total probability in a quiz.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Suppose I flip a coin, and the coin comes up tails or heads.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose it's a fair coin.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The probability of tails or of heads is both 1/2.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now let's say that the coin comes up tails, and I just accept and don't do anything.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But suppose it comes up heads, and I flip it again,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and after 1 flip, I accept the result.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
My quiz for you is what is the probability that the final result is heads?

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's an example of total probability.
