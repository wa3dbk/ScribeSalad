00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.059
In deciding among the possibilities the tradeoff between locality and

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.240
complexity needs to be considered. In the centralized choice,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.890
there's a single place that handles all invariants, but that implementation of

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.360
that place can be quite complex. On the other hand, complete distribution.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.620
While allowing each invariant to be handled in a simple way, can lead to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.170
solutions that are hard to debug. Because of the many moving parts involved.
