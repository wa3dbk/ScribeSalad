00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.850
Okay let's, let's summarize this. What are all the things that UML can

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.360
provide for you in state descriptions? At the top is the word tracking, that's

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.700
the state label. We can have the entry action, we can have the exit action.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.610
UML supports the ideas of internal transitions. These are, you can

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.224
think of these as self transitions without the entry and exit actions. Okay,

00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:27.780
UML now also supports the idea of activities. So we have actions and activities.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.990
The difference here is that you can think of actions from the point of view of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.650
the system as being things which are instantaneous. Typically that means that

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.010
we're turning something on or we're turning something off. And the time that it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.440
takes to do that doesn't play in the rest of the, rest of the system.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.260
Activities, however, are things which take time. Okay, the key word there is do,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.830
and we're calling some kind of method which is going to take some time.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.160
So we're going to be in this state while, while we're following the target. And

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.900
deferred events are a a, a special situation in,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.890
in UML in which the set of events that the system is responding to are,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.120
are queued, that is, put into a queue, and only processed at a later time.
