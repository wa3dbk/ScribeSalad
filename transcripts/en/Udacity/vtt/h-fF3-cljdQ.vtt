00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.560
There's not one definition for big data, its

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.092
a very subjective term. Most people would certainly

00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:08.360
consider a data set of several terabytes to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.746
be big data. But there are certainly plenty

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:13.581
of people using Hadoop on significantly smaller data

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:16.360
sets with really great results. A reasonable definition

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.360
of big data might be, it's data that's

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.490
too big to be processed on a single machine.
