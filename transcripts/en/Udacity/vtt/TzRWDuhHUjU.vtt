00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.932
We should multiply this equation by negative 2. If I distribute this negative 2

00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:11.212
to each term, then I can see that I were to get negative 2 times 5x, which is

00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:15.498
negative 10x. Negative 2 times positive 2y, which is negative 4y. And negative 2

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:19.708
times positive 1, which is negative 2. And look at that, we're ready to do

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:24.366
elimination, if positive 10x and negative 10x. These terms have the same

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:29.028
absolute value of 10 but one is positive and the other's negative, so we know

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.894
when we add them they sum to 0.
