00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.910
Janet's time would be 250 divided by x, and Rohan's time would be 300 divided

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.084
by x plus 20. Remember, time equals distance divided by rate. So we just take

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:18.910
Janet's distance 250, and divide it by her rate, which is x. We do the same

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.616
thing for Rohan. We take his distance of 300 and divide it by his rate, which

00:00:23.616 --> 00:00:25.623
is x plus 20.
