00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.400
The next category of patterns, in the Gang of Four book, are the structural

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.020
patterns of which the composite pattern is example we've already seen.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.422
Some other ones that are provided include the adapter pattern which you

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:16.490
would use to convert an existing interface to look like another interface.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.500
The bridge pattern, in which you decouple an abstraction and implementation.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.230
The decorator pattern, in which you would add a single feature to an existing

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.921
class. The facade pattern, which provides a higher-level interface for

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.500
a subsystem. This might typically be used in a situation where you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.530
have some non-object oriented legacy code, which you'd want to access from

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.480
within an object oriented application. And you need to make it look like

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.510
an object oriented interface. The flyweight pattern allows you to use sharing to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.270
support large number of fine-grained objects. So imagine a situation, for

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.580
example, when you're doing text processing, and each of the characters you'd

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.869
like to treat as an object. Well, this can be quite expensive, because, because,

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:03.770
there, because be tens of thousands of such objects. Instead flyweight,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.040
allows provides you a way of doing this without creating all those objects.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.320
Finally the proxy pattern allows you to control access to an object.
