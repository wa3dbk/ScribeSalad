00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.480
Welcome back. I hope that exercise went great.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.023
Now, let's talk about another important Datastore concept,

00:00:08.023 --> 00:00:11.188
keys. When you store an entity in the

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:14.100
Datastore, the Datastore will assign a key to

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.030
it. This key uniquely identifies the entity and

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.380
it's used for many different purposes. They are

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.775
two ways a key can be generated. Let's take a look. The first one is when

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.480
Datastore automatically generates this key. Let's say we

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.970
define the profile kind with these properties. And inserted

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.660
it for the first time. In this case, the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.080
Datastore will automatically assign a key value to it.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.970
The other way is that you specify what is called a key name or ID. In this case,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.440
Datastore will use that value to generate the key.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.870
This is a good alternative when you have something

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.900
that is unique for each entity. Because it can clearly

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.560
take us to our front entity based on this value

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.235
so it's easier to find. But observe that statement. The

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:04.610
Keyname/ID must be unique for all entities of that kind. For

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.450
our profile kind that is exactly the case because we

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.980
have decided to use the user ID to to uniquely

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.820
identify each profile identity. The value of having user ID

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.360
as the key name is that we can retrieve the profile

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.310
entity directly using this value. And remember, since the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.500
user object is the first parameter to cloud endpoints API

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.950
methods. It will become a convenient way to get

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.720
the profile, but we'll look more into this later. If

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.770
you are familiar with relational database modeling, you probably

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.100
see that this is very similar to the concept of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.110
a primary key. There, as well as with Datastore,

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.490
you have the option of letting the database generate the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.460
primary key or use the value of your choice.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.620
But now, it's for you to do some work
