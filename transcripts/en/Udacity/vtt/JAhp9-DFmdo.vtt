00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
But what we need to do now is consider this particular message M&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We want to compute the probability of the intersection of those events,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that the selected message is M and the message encrypts to C.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm going to make that a quiz and see if you can figure out what that is yourself.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here are your choices.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
See if you can figure out what the probability of M equals M

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
intersected with the encryption of M equals C.
