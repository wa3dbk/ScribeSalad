The answer is Veronica. Susan has a PhD, I have a Master's Degree, she's

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:11.140
awesome at recess, but still, it's the baby who has the most neurons. I know,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.675
it's crazy. I couldn't believe it when I first learned this either, but we have

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:19.606
more neurons at age two than we have at any other time in our lives. But

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:22.420
neurons only function when they're sending coordinated signals between other

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.060
neurons. So, as we develop and learn more, and get more control over our

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.380
bodies, neurons become more and more solidly connected. Remember from the brain

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.997
lesson? Again, this goes with the if you don't use it, you lose it. Neurons

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:39.230
that are not used are in fact lost.
