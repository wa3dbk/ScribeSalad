00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.480
Alright, talk me through it.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.280
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm going to say that I think I know the answers for this

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.109
one. And let's start with the first one.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.810
So R1 equals minus R2, which you'll notice

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.350
they're equal and opposite. And in fact if you add them up, that is you sum

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.129
them you end up with zero. So I'm

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.050
going to say that's a zero sum stochastic game.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.130
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.690
&gt;&gt; For two, basically you're saying that for all intends

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.450
and purposes, there's only one agent. Which just makes it

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.050
a regular Markov decision process.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So isn't that interesting? That

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.480
just by the other player irrelevant, then

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.820
that's what an MDP is. It's like a game where the other players are irrelevant.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, which, both of my children are like that.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650
But okay, I think that's pretty cool. And in fact, I'd

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.111
be right in saying that R2 doesn't have to equal

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.450
to zero. As long as it just equals to some constant.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's, I mean, constant. Actually, depending on

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.570
how you think about it, it could be, we could just ignore

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.240
the whole R2 thing and just say that. As far as the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.750
first player is concerned, since the second player really has no impact

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.970
on anything. It doesn't matter. But the reason I put that in

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.750
is I got kind of scared that like. I feel like if I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.410
lived my life and knew that my actions effected the state and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.050
my rewards, but they were also effecting the rewards of somebody who

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.930
didn't matter. Like I feel like that would actually still have an influence

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.910
on me. Sure, but then the way you get around that is

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.167
you would say, well, your R1 is actually equal to your R2.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:22.475
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:23.194
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It would somehow [UNKNOWN].

00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:28.010
&gt;&gt; So, so if I had gone like that, wouldn't

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.940
that be the case then that we're saying? Oh yeah,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.050
I see. That the second player is irrelevant, but the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.020
reward, but the first player may be relevant to both.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.740
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, yeah I like that a little bit better. Yeah,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.140
I mean, once again, it all boils down to changing the rewards. Okay,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.430
and so given A and B, I know the answer to

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.780
three must be C, unless you're tricking me, and it could be

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.230
A or B again. And which I suppose you could have

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.900
done, you didn't say they were mutually exclusive. So let me actually

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.980
argue why it would be C? Well there is only one

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.070
state and since you're in a stochastic game and you're going to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.500
be continually doing this. It means that you're basically doing the same

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.870
game over and over and over again, so it's a repeated game.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah so in particular the actions impact the rewards,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.580
but they're not going to impact the transitions

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.030
because you're always just going to back to

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.250
where you were. The discount factor plays the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.978
role of, of decided when the game's going

00:02:12.978 --> 00:02:15.335
to end, stochastically. And, so yeah, it's exactly

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:16.679
a repeated game, this is the one I

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:18.839
feel most comfortable about because this really does

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.989
recover that same model we've been talking about.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:21.880
&gt;&gt; I like it.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.510
&gt;&gt; Cool! Now, given that we actually are now

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.450
in a model that generalizes MDPs, it would be

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.970
nice if we can generalize some of the things

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.250
that we did with MDPs, like Q learning and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.760
value iteration to this, this more general setting.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.050
So, that's what we're going to try next.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.640
&gt;&gt; Cool.
