00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.930
So as a startup, when you want to

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.760
implement an incentive plan into your
marketing plan, what do you need to do?

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.340
So first of all, like everything,
it has to make sense.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.750
Your offering should be
part of your product,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.660
which means that your offering
should make sense to you and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.380
you need to encourage something
that you want your users to do.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.570
You want the offering to be precise for
your users,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.730
is something that offer money.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.040
It doesn't have to be money,
it can also be virtual coins.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.320
Let's say that I'm promoting
a virtual game, and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.650
if you're going to invite your friends.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.770
I'm going to give you 50 coins.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.560
Okay.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.220
I don't care about it, but
my users care about it, and

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.540
they will eventually,
hopefully pay for it.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.520
So they think this is a good thing.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.130
So a few examples about how to
create great promotional plans.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.860
First of all PayPal,
they probably created the first and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.918
most famous promotional plans for
start ups.

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:59.340
They basically paid the users to open
an account and invite someone else.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.320
Thinking the target was if you
open an account you get ten bucks

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.530
into your account,
do whatever you want with it.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.010
If you're inviting someone else,
you're getting ten bucks and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.760
he's getting ten bucks.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.070
And that helped them to go to about
100 million users in a very fast way.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.730
They obviously didn't pay so
much money for so many people, they

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.250
reduced it gradually from five bucks
to one buck, eventually to nothing.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.630
But that really helped
them go significantly.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.220
Another example that people may know
even better is the Dropbox example.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.680
They gave a lot of storage to their
users who invite other peoples so

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.440
you could get a free account basically
of up to 12 gigs of free storage room.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.560
Back in the day.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.040
Back in the day was like three
years ago, four years ago.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.260
That was a lot to get.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.310
Today, I have like two tera and
I'm paying ten bucks.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.800
But that was huge and
people was competing each other.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.030
Who will get to their friends faster,
know to invite them and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.390
make sure that they will
accept the invitation.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.500
And both examples the people in
DropBox makes perfect sense.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.270
People, it's all about the money, you're
getting the money in your account,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.270
you can do whatever you want with it.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.750
And you can use it to buy on eBay for

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.480
example, that was the best source
of growth back in the day.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.380
And for Dropbox.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.510
We're a storage company.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.030
You're getting free storage.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.280
Invite your friends.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.750
That had them grow to so many users,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.230
and people are still trying to
imitate those promotional trends.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.960
Another example is Zynga.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.250
When you're inviting your friends,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.760
you're getting virtual currency for
to see the games that they're promoting.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.460
Not only Zynga, obviously, everybody
who creates games that has some kind of

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.490
virtual currency in it,
let's you do that.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.050
And by earning that virtual currency,
by earning those things that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.450
you want in order to pursue your dreams,
they can encourage this behavior.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.790
Another example is Lyft.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.380
Lyft is competing with Uber in many
geographies throughout the US and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.718
throughout the world.

00:03:00.718 --> 00:03:06.650
And Lyft wants to get more market share,
how can they do that?

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.770
One of the strategies is to
pay you to ride with them.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.780
So let's say I want to get from point
A to point B in Manhattan and this

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.215
is a ride that will cost me with Uber
20 bucks, with a yellow cab, 15 bucks.

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:26.220
Lyft will give you money
to ride with them so

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.140
it will cost you five bucks,
or six bucks.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.970
In this way, they can encourage the
behavior that they want to encourage,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.090
that forming a habit,
if you associated Lyft with

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.210
taking a cab by encouraging you and
giving you money to use them.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.340
One major thing that you need to be
very cautious about when you're doing

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.660
incentive problem is making
sure that your lifetime value,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.910
your LTV, is higher than your
customer acquisition cost, your CAC.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.950
A lot of companies tend to

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.630
exaggerate with acquiring users,
focusing on growth,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.730
which is obviously the most important
thing for an early stage startup.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.400
As you grow, as you become more and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.870
more successful,
people take advantage of that.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.320
The math doesn't make sense anymore.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.990
It was working for paper.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.190
But as you're growing more and
more users, you don't want to do it

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.550
anymore because you want to encourage
them to actually pay for that data.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.990
You don't want to make them dependent
on your specific dynamics and

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.600
mechanics for earning virtual currency.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.220
That can be something very dangerous for

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.330
a startup,
to be dependent on the incentive plan.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.000
And are focusing on
keeping the users engaged

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.420
further the dynamics
of the product itself.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.900
One more thing is that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.880
incentives can only enhance
the quality of your product.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.750
It will not replace anything, so if your
product is great, the thing that you're

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.620
doing with incentives is encourage what
you hope that your users will be doing,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.470
that's the final push,
that's not the main thing.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.021
You push them to share,
you push them to activate,

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:11.820
you push them to use it one time because
you know that once they use it for

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.110
that one time they'll be hooked,
but it won't replace that product.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.350
It won't replace that
user position structure.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.610
&gt;&gt; Okay so now that we've gone
over the general checklist for

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.870
launch let's explore ways
to get your app noticed.
