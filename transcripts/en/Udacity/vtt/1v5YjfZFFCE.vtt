00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.724
Finally, you get to program. Most of our exercises will be in JavaScript. Even

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:08.252
if you don't know JavaScript, you should be able to get through the first few

00:00:08.252 --> 00:00:12.140
exercises without too much difficulty. Your goal in this exercise will be to

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.670
draw a square. To start with, you have to create a geometry object which allows

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.030
you to add vertices to it. Which let's you make triangles and squares and so on.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.308
So, this geometry object will consist of vertices along with a face. Vertices

00:00:25.308 --> 00:00:29.703
are the corners of a polygon, usually a triangle. Once we've created our

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:34.720
geometry object, we add vertices by pushing them onto the array. Basically, push

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.546
means add to the end of an array. And JavaScript keeps track of how large the

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:41.937
array is and so on, you don't have to worry about allocating space for it. And

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:47.558
these are our three vertices. We use Vector3 for both points and vectors within

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:52.182
3JS, within this library. So, these are floating point numbers in fact. And

00:00:52.182 --> 00:00:58.497
define three points in x, y and z coordinates. A geometry object also has faces

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:03.790
in it. By using a Face3, we define three different vertices that we're going to

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.077
make a single face out of. In other words, we're going to define a triangle. The

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:13.837
way that face indices work is they point to the various vertices in the array.

00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:18.330
So, this is vertex zero. We always start counting from zero. Vertex 1 and vertex

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.308
2, and by listing out those indices, 0, 1 and 2, so these are integers, that

00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:28.523
says this triangle has this, this, and this vertex.
