00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.500
Okay, so let's look at a register renaming quiz solution. So

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.100
we have seen the first instruction renamed, let's now rename the second one.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.362
It is going to be an add. R1 and

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:17.920
R2 are going to be P1 and P7. R1 is where we put the result.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.200
Remember, you don't use this. You rename it to the next physical register. So

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.020
we have P8. Then we have the multiplication of R4 and R4.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.900
This is P4, P4. You write the new value of R2, and

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.150
that means that this P7 now becomes P9. Then we have the add of R3 and

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.120
R2, which are P3 and P9. Write as a result to R3,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.070
which becomes P10 before that happens.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.608
And then this multiplication will read R6 and R6 that's a P6 and P6 here.

00:00:56.608 --> 00:01:02.510
Producer is [UNKNOWN] inputted in R2. So now R2 gets to become P11.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.830
And finally, we have this add of R5 and R2.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.430
This is P5 and P11. Producer is [UNKNOWN] inputted in R5. So

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.660
R5, now instead of P5 becomes P12. And, that's the solution to the quiz.
