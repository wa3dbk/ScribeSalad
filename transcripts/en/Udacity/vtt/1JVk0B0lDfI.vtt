00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.150
So users, we talked before
about how important they are.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.380
So what can we be looking at to
gauge their interest in our product?

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.070
&gt;&gt; There are two reports
that could help us.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.330
The Loyalty and
Recency reports can show users interest

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.440
in your app based on the frequency and
recently that they used it.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.480
It's a great way to recognize
the users that love your app,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.510
over the ones that just like it.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.990
As Paul Graham said you want
100 people to love your app

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.480
over 1,000 that just like it.
