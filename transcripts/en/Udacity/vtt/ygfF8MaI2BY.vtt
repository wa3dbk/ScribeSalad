00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome back!

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.230
In the previous lessons,
you deploy your own Hadoop clusters.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.570
A long running cluster is great when you
have many jobs and it's in constant use.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.610
However, for many cases, you won't
need a full cluster all the time.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.730
It will just be sitting there idle.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.040
Amazon EC2 instances are charged hourly,
so

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.710
if your cluster is idle,
you're wasting money.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.776
A better option is to deploy a cluster
only when you have jobs to run.

00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:26.040
When the the tasks are done,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.260
you can shut down the cluster until
the next time you have a job.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.840
Maintaining the cluster also takes
time away from other projects.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.070
For a small organization there might not
be enough people to spend time worrying

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.730
about a cluster.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.440
To solve these problems,
you can use an on-demand Hadoop cluster.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.460
Let's look at some options.
