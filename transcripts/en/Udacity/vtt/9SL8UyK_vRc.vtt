00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.455
We'll want to have the equation x squared plus y squared equals 16. Great

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:09.506
thinking if you got this equation. Remember that circles that are centered at

00:00:09.506 --> 00:00:14.746
the origin are of this form, x squared plus y squared equals r squared. We know

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:21.458
that the radius is 4, so we simply replace r with the value of 4. So we'll have

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:26.531
x squared plus y squared equals 4 squared, which is really 16.
