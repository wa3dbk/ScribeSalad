00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.290
With a wider viewport, things are a
little trickier, but still not too bad.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.500
Here, the green and the light blue
boxes are 50%, but now we've got

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.980
this red box which is taking up about
a third or 33% of its container's width.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.513
And the orange box is taking up two
thirds or 66% of it's container width,

00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:26.940
but what's going on when we resize
our viewport from here to here?

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.260
At the largest size,
the container around all of the boxes,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.830
becomes fixed width, but the widths of
the elements inside it don't change
