00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.380
Users can get connected with
your app in many different ways,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.020
from recommendations from family,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.520
friends, or colleagues, searching
an app store, or using a search engine.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.526
Research done by Google and
found that about 52% of app users

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:17.476
surveyed found new apps through family,
friends, and colleagues.

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:22.920
40% through just browsing an app store,
and 25% through search engines.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.200
So, you can think beyond just the app
store to get your app out there.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700
You're going to want to get family,
friends, and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.310
colleagues talking about your app and
sharing it.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.770
So there are a ton of different
distribution channels

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.910
to give your users access to your app.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.870
But what's right for your business?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.670
Now here are some ideas to
kind of get you started.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.930
You could consider having your
app preloaded into a phone.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.760
No, I'm sorry, Apple and
Samsung probably aren't going to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.110
come beating down your door just
to load your app on their phones.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.460
But you can pay for it.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.440
Pay a lot that is,
it's pretty expensive.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.690
Your app will be preloaded onto
a specific mobile device and

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.579
people will just be exposed to it.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.650
And their more likely
to actually use it.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.080
So the conversion rate for

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.000
these preloaded apps is
significantly higher than average.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.964
You can optimize your own website,

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:11.631
make sure to have a widget that can
be pasted on to a mobile website or

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:15.778
Facebook pages for example that will
take your users directly to your app.

00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:18.496
Or, you could create a mobile
web version of your app.

00:01:18.496 --> 00:01:23.147
Now creating a mobile web version coded
in HTML5 is a great way to enable wide

00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:27.210
distribution outside of just
the smartphone audience.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.010
Also, people can engage with your
product before they commit to

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.500
downloading it, which is a much
higher commitment on their end.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.420
And don't forget about
the marketing workhorse, email.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.470
You can also consider just emailing
links to your app to your users.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.170
We'll go over many more options
later in the course, but

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.490
I want you to get started
thinking about these things.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.550
Start getting creative,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.080
because when it comes to
marketing ideas, sky's the limit.
