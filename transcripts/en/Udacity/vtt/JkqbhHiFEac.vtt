00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.719
When performing an analysis, we can usually achieve statistical rigor by

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.790
way of a significance test. These test to find whether or

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.990
not a sample of data can disprove some conventional wisdom or

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.410
assumption, with a predefined level of confidence. Let's first discuss at

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.060
a high level why statistical rigors important. Let's say that you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.410
worked in an office of 1000 people, and you wanted to

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.100
find out what the most popular favorite color in your office

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.315
was. It would be a lot of work to ask all

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.470
1,000 people. So you decide to just poll 10 people

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.940
to get a pretty good idea of the office's favorite

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.730
color. When you ask these 10 people, each one says

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.330
"blue." With that statistic, you might say," Well, since these

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.600
10 people out of 1,000 said blue is their favorite

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.650
color, blue must be everyone in the office's favorite color."

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.270
Of course both you and I have some intuitive idea

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.480
that this probably isn't true. We just happened to come

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.390
across ten people who all liked blue. Statistics formalizes

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.130
this kind of logic. So we can assess the feasibility

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.570
of a result that we get with a smaller

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.570
sample when trying to say something about a larger population.
