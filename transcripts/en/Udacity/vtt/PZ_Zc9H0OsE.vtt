00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.170
So remember that set announcement servelet that you created

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.620
earlier? Now you're going to set up cron job

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.370
to run it regularly, say every minute, every ten

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.760
minutes, whatever, to update the announcement. So to set up

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.623
your cron job, you're going to need to create

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:19.940
a cron.xml file and configure it to run /cron/set_announcement

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.610
because that's the path that we set up for

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.390
our set, set announcement function. And then specify the schedule,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.150
let's say once per minute. The development server on

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.690
localhost doesn't run cron jobs, so when you're ready, go

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.044
ahead and deploy your app to appspot. Then add one

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:38.552
or more conferences that have between zero and five seats

00:00:38.552 --> 00:00:41.260
available. And the easiest way to do that is

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.050
just to create a new conference with max attendees less

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.866
than five. And then use the cron viewer in the

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:50.340
Admin Console to make sure that your cron job's running.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.200
And then of course go ahead and get the latest

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.450
announcement to check that the latest announcement did get updated. And

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.630
you can do this either, you can use either the mem-cache

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.960
viewer or the API's console to get the latest announcement. So

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.190
now your cron job is humming along, it'll keep going

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.970
by itself. That means it's going to run a query to look

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.030
for conferences every minute, or however often you scheduled it to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.520
run. It's helpful for learning purposes to see the cron job

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.620
running frequently, but it's not a good practice to leave cron

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.160
jobs running more frequently than you really need them. This cron job

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.870
does a fairly simple query, and then puts a value in mem

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.120
cache, for which there's no daily quota. But if your cron job

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.460
did something that intensively hit the data store it could easily use

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.060
up much more quota. So you need to think about what your

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.740
cron jobs do and how often they need to run. I've accidentally

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.610
used up my entire daily quota running a cron job that searched

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.420
all the conferences and saved results in the data store, so

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.410
I learned my lesson the hard way. So go ahead and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.270
change the frequency to once an hour and when you've done

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
that come over here and check this box. Alternatively, you could disable

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.200
the cron job completely by uploading an empty cron job config,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.510
but remember if you just delete the cron config file completely

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.500
then the one that's already up on app spot stays running.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.610
So one more quick quiz. How do you schedule your cron job

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.780
to run once every two hours? Go ahead and enter

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.610
that value in here. And that's it for cron jobs.
