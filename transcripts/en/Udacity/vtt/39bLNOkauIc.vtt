00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
And there answer here of course is yes,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.300
so as long as the program stops

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.660
and after a certain finite amount of time,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.390
we will get the answer yes,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.030
simply due to the fact that the program has terminated,

00:00:10.030 --> 99:59:59.000
so you know for sure that this a program that halts.
