00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.761
Let's go through each one of these before we find our answer. Mu minus x will

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:09.612
give us a positive number because mu is larger than x in both cases, so that's

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:14.826
the first thing we did. But that doesn't tell us how many standard deviations

00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:20.004
away from the mean x is, x minus mu will give us the opposite of this one. Which

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:25.284
is basically the negative distance, x minus mu times sigma doesn't really make

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:30.793
sense. That would be multiplying thins distance by this standard deviation, x

00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:35.856
minus mu divided by sigma is closer to what we did, but this will give us the

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:40.755
negative distance. However, later you'll see that this equation is very

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:45.898
important. And again, we didn't multiply by sigma. So, this is the correct

00:00:45.898 --> 00:00:51.306
answer to find just how far in terms of standard deviations x is from the mean.

00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:57.162
We found the distance which is mu minus X, and then we divide it by the standard

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:58.106
deviation.
