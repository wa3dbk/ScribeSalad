00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.625
The answer is 3 cube root 2. Let's see how to get that. 54 is just equal to 27

00:00:05.637 --> 00:00:11.695
times 2. We can rewrite this as an expression with exponents and then distribute

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:17.525
the exponent to the factors. 27 is equal to 3 to the 3rd power. So, this reduces

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:21.190
to 3 times 2 to the 1 3rd power or just 3 cube root 2.
