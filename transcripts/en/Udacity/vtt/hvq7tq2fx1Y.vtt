00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.382
So, with adolescents comes a new kind of cognitive ability according to Piaget

00:00:04.382 --> 00:00:09.129
and he called this stage formal operational. He called it formal operational

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.256
because formal logic, or making inferences is possible for the first time. This

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:19.660
stage begins around age 12 and goes up through adulthood. And the hallmark

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.885
characteristic of formal operational thinking is the ability to think about

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:29.874
abstract ideas and also, the ideal. So, for instance we start to wonder about

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:33.189
what we believe about religion, about politics, and whether what our parents

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:39.156
told us is really beliefs that we hold. We also get into gaming, and avatars,

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:44.264
and fantasy. Because those things are about the ideal and the possible rather

00:00:44.264 --> 00:00:50.199
than the real. So, another cognitive skill that we see in formal operations is

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.231
called metacognition, and metacognition is the ability to think about your

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:59.696
thinking, to reflect on your beliefs. So, for instance, we see this in

00:00:59.696 --> 00:01:05.680
hypothesis testing and scientific reasoning. And an hypothesis testing requires

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.385
that the person understand that what they believe is tentative, may or may not

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:15.033
be true and needs to be tested against evidence. So, this is a scale that we

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.210
see in formal operational thinking. So, another important point to make about

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.210
formal operational thinking, is that in contrast to the other stages of

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.569
cognitive development, progression through it is not automatic. So we see even

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.463
in adults who have superstitious beliefs for instances, and these beliefs are

00:01:31.463 --> 00:01:36.918
not tested against evidence. And in fact, when you ask people for why these

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:40.428
believe these things like belief in UFOs or palm reading or astrology, people

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:46.708
say, oh I just believe it. It's just true. So, just because you're an

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:52.001
adolescent or an adult doesn't automatically mean you're thinking formally or

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:57.046
scientifically or critically. So it's not just thoughts that are changing

00:01:57.046 --> 00:02:01.242
during adolescence, it's also your brain. So we're going to throw you back to

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:04.800
Lauren who will tell you about brain changes in adolescence.
