00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.560
Just as a refresher,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.400
let's recall the basic elements of computational photography.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.220
But first, let's imagine what is our scenario.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.490
We want to take a picture of a 3D scene, as demonstrated here, and

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.530
what we want to convert into is a picture.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.000
So in essence, what we have done is we have taken the rays of light that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.470
are illuminating the scene, and converted it into a two-dimensional picture.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.840
Now recall that the main aspects of the computational photography started with

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.240
illuminating the scene, the optics that were used to then take the light

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.880
information and get it onto a sensor which was then converted into an image.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.150
And then we can do various types of image processing on it.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.210
That would be displayed into a picture like this.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.060
As you may, may remember, our goal was to computationalize each and

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.430
every aspect of this pipeline.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.190
Today of course, in this lesson, what I'm interested in having you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.400
start thinking about how the digital information,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.680
the sensor, can be actually used to generate a representation that we

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.810
can actually do various types of image processing on.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.650
So then we can display an image.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.580
So the three main aspects that we're interested in here is how

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.270
the digital information from the sensor is put on to generate an image that we

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.860
can do various types of processing on it to generate a picture.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.530
We will discuss more aspects of how a sensor does generate this kind of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.600
a signal in a later lecture.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.790
Today the goal is for us to start thinking about how we can actually start

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.540
doing image processing and computer vision types of techniques on images.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.690
So, the goal that we have in this lesson is to be able to

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.760
make an image a computable entity.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.040
That is, we can run various, various types of computational processes on it, and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.010
actually allow us to start thinking of what is a digital image, and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.990
what's a representation of a digital image, to convert and create images and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.760
pictures that we can use for processing.
