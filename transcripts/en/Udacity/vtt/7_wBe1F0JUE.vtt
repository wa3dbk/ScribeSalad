the final project app you worked on in the

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.950
previous lesson. And much like you saw in this

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.700
lesson, you're going to add another level of detail to

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.180
your high level flow. You should also add callouts

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.250
in presi, to show how mobile constraints will be

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.480

find in the instruction notes, that will help you out.
