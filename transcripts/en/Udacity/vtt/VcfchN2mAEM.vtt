00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.070
Next we'll speak with Dr. David Kibbe,
president and CEO of Direct Trust,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.270
and a senior adviser to the American
Academy of Family Physicians,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.780
the largest primary care physician
organization in the United States.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.570
So good morning, David, and
thank you very much for

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.380
taking the time to be with us today.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.370
&gt;&gt; Good morning, Mark.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.780
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.882
&gt;&gt; So at this point, the students
are aware of Direct Trust and

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:34.270
the role it plays in
establishing trust across HISPs.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.990
But, of course, with health IT,
adoption is always an issue.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.290
So, where is Direct Trust in
terms of adoption at this point?

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, we've made a lot of
progress, Mark, in the last year.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.810
Your students are I'm
sure aware of direct

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.330
as a protocol in a set
of specifications.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.300
They're probably not aware of
the extent to which direct

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.635
service providers have been active
in this sector of the industry.

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:08.553
DirectTrust membership has grown
from about 50 members this time

00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:11.064
last year to over 135 members.

00:01:11.064 --> 00:01:13.732
We now have 33 health ISPs or

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:19.068
HISPs who are providing services
to a range of customers and

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:23.673
clients, including
electronic health records.

00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:26.909
And of course the electronic health
records are provided direct to their

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.086
customers, who are provider
organizations and

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:31.610
individuals in those organizations.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.030
We also have HIEs,
some federal agencies now,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.850
and a growing number of personal
health records who are involved.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.614
So, right now that network
serves approximately 6,000 to

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:49.650
7,000 healthcare organizations.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.900
There are over 250,000 direct addresses
that have been provisioned for

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.990
those parties in those organizations and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.150
those numbers have been
doubling every three months.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.420
So we think that by the beginning
of 2015, there will be

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.531
approximately 200 electronic health
records, depending on Direct Trust

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:16.610
accredited service providers,
and approximately a million

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.250
direct addresses being supplied within
the provider community nationwide.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.380
&gt;&gt; That's certainly impressive.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.670
In health IT right up there
with adoption is use cases.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.210
The purposes to which technology
is used to approve care.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.780
You've told me about a very
interesting example in hospitals and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.820
transitions of care where patients
are leaving the hospital and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.710
going to a long-term care facility.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.200
Could you tell us a bit about that?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Certainly.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.160
A couple things to keep in mind is
that we're clearly seeing the network

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.820
effect her.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.640
The hockey stick curve of adoption
is growing very, very quickly,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.590
but we're also seeing that there's
a long tail here in terms of use cases.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.670
The primary use case that's driving the
adoption of Direct exchange right now

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.230
is of course stage two meaningful use.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.200
As hospitals and medical practices seek
to meet the transitions of care and

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.799
patient engagement objectives in stage
two meaningful use which require direct

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.000
exchange, hospitals are probably the
most active now in terms of using direct

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.580
exchange to send referral documents, in
particular transitions of care clinical

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.680
summary, both to provider organizations
on discharge of the patients or

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.880
just before, but
also to skilled nursing facilities.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.180
So we have a growing number of
skilled nursing facilities and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.060
rehab centers that are, strictly
speaking, not meaningful users, but

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.810
they are endpoints for meaningful users
and are starting to see the need for

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.850
them to have direct
exchange capabilities.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.870
I would add to that that claims
attachment is a growing use case,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.870
again not really of meaningful use, and

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.665
the federal agencies have
referral needs to replace fax and

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:13.640
e-fax mail with direct exchange,
and that's also growing quickly.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.769
&gt;&gt; Another interesting example,
I believe it was in Tennessee and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.660
Kentucky, is the use of direct by health
departments to collect very patients

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.260
specific data about those patients
with sexually transmitted diseases.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.830
Can you tell us a bit about that?

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really exciting
grassroots use case, and we're

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.000
seeing several like this around the
country, in rural areas of the country.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.870
This involves public health clinics in
two states, Kentucky and Tennessee,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.270
using direct exchange for patients
who they refer to one another or

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.750
see in common and those are patients
with STDs as you mentioned.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.420
They are also involving an army base,
Fort Campbell, that has its own clinic.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.910
And just been contacted by
the department of defense,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.710
we have a meeting next week to talk
about how they can provide direct

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.110
services at their installations
within the coming months.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.844
&gt;&gt; Well, so, the use cases we've talked
about so far are provider to provider.

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:28.145
The students are familiar with view,
download,

00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:31.415
and transmit,
the VDT requirement meaningful use, too.

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:34.775
That would seem like a role for direct.

00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:38.241
What can you tell us about that?

00:05:38.241 --> 00:05:42.535
&gt;&gt; The use of direct
exchange by providers and

00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:47.470
patients to communicate protected health
information is an enormous potential.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.480
We have about 15
companies in Direct Trust

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.320
who are what I call next generation
personal health records.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.340
These are personal health record
companies like Healthy Circles that

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.660
are contemplating or actually
implementing now, direct services for

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.270
their customers who are primarily
patients and consumers, not providers.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.140
So that could grow very quickly but

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.330
it requires first that the provider to
provider infrastructure be in place.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.170
I don't expect to see large scale use
of Direct exchange in the provider,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.030
excuse me,
in the consumer space until 2015.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.680
Because if you want to communicate
with your provider using Direct,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.790
which is a wonderful idea.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.570
It's secure messaging with attachments.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.870
Or you want devices to send direct
messages to your provider organization.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.640
The provider organization has to be
capable of receiving those messages and

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.220
attachments first.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.110
And we're very much still in that
building phase on the provider side.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.745
&gt;&gt; David, you mentioned something, that
I hadn't really thought about before.

00:06:58.745 --> 00:07:03.920
Are the device manufacturers,
the companies that are hoping to put

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.260
devices into patient's homes so that
the patients with chronic disease, for

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.820
example, can be monitored
more continuously,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.199
are they seeing direct as a technology
they want to build into these devices?

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.359
Yes, without question.

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:22.580
There's one of the things that gives
me real confidence that Direct

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.258
is a disruptive innovation is this
effect you're starting to see where of

00:07:28.258 --> 00:07:34.781
course we're talking about S/MIME over
SMTP, email messages with attachments.

00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:39.798
But there's a lot of innovation
occurring around the use of that very

00:07:39.798 --> 00:07:44.992
simple technology to replace
interfaces of various kinds, including

00:07:44.992 --> 00:07:52.020
device to device interactions, or device
to server Interactions and connections.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.680
That innovation is sort
of quiet at this time,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.140
there's not a lot of noise around it.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.490
But there's significant interest in
the part of device manufacturers and

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.030
also the payers for
example who believe that

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.930
Direct can be a last
mile from the device or

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.290
from the data center to some end point,
which could be the provider's inbox.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.170
&gt;&gt; Well, one final question.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.790
Of course there are always challenges,
it sounds like exciting times for

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.140
Direct and Direct Trust, but what do you
see is the most significant challenges

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.520
that have to be over come
in the next few years for

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.940
Direct to really achieve its potential.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:42.049
&gt;&gt; You know it, it always goes back to
some payment or business rationale.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.320
Right now, the incentives for

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.370
provider organizations to exchange
information with one another easily and

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:56.690
affordably using standards
like Direct is not strong.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.630
It's growing with the movement of ACO's,
but

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.840
I think we still have a hesitancy on
the part of providers to move data when

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.470
they're getting paid for
duplicating care, for example.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.340
I also think that we have to
overcome the stigma of patients

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.698
asking their providers and the provider
organization for that information.

00:09:19.698 --> 00:09:24.672
There still is a hesitancy on the part
of many institutions to make it easy for

00:09:24.672 --> 00:09:27.095
patients to get their information.

00:09:27.095 --> 00:09:29.277
Having standard in place,
of course, helps.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:32.412
But it doesn't motivate people.

00:09:32.412 --> 00:09:34.385
Standards are not motivators.

00:09:34.385 --> 00:09:36.893
Standards are enablers.

00:09:36.893 --> 00:09:39.560
&gt;&gt; Well David, I thank you again.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.050
I particularly thank you for your final
comments, which just emphasize again

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.940
something I tried to get across in this
course which is that without the right

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.200
incentives, all the technologies in
the world won't change healthcare.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.750
&gt;&gt; I would agree with that
statement very strongly, Mark.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.960
Thank you for the opportunity to speak
with your audience, with your class.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.613
And if there are individuals
who want to contact me or
