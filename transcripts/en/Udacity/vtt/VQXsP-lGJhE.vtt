00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me write down for any possible outcome of the binomial, the corresponding probability.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So just for our little Python program implementing the familiar expression

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of binomial distribution and with this program, I'll get the following.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Practically speaking, all the first ones have zero probability.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is about something times 10 to the minus 5 and then over here, very small probability has come up,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and they go all the way to 0.34 for 14, somewhere between 13 and 14 is the most likely outcome,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but even those numbers aren't huge because there are so many of those up to 15.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So you've build these tables before, I spared to the work this time around

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and the very basic logic here is to not draw a line such that the total probability

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
contained on top of the line and it's this, doesn't exceed 5%.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So here's a question for you, where would you draw the line?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you draw it here, for example, then give me the number just on top of the line, 3.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you're going to draw over here, it will be 13. Neither of those are correct.

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Draw the line where the probability contained above the line doesn't exceed 5%.
