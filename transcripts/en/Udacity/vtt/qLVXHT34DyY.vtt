00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.310
This is a reminder, again.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.969
Let's look inside a camera.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.590
We've looked at this image before.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.670
This is a film camera with film here, the optics and the lens here, the mirror

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.910
that moves away when the shutter is released, and that hits the film, and of

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.840
course the, the prism that let's you see exactly what are you going to capture.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.280
So light goes in this way, and the mirror, depending on when I

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.410
press the shutter, moves up and then of course it hits the sensor.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
And of course, what we now need to figure out is how big the opening would be

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.720
here, and also how long do we keep this shutter open to get

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.300
the light in at the appropriate level to get the picture we want.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.450
Here I'm basically showing you another schematic of a camera.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.140
And again, in this instance, it's again an SLR camera.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.480
This is the lens assembly.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.890
And here you notice, the lens is basically a bunch of different types of lenses.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.430
It could be a mixture of concave and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.910
convex lenses with the purpose of basically kind of focusing the light

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.220
towards where we want the image sensor to get the best information.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.720
So this is the size of the aperture that would let the right kind of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.900
light in here.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.940
This is the shutter.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.870
Opens and closes when we press the shutter release on a camera.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.500
Again, it'll basically be open for a specific time.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.420
The aperture, of course,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.890
would be open all the time at different size to let the kind of light in.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.490
This is the only device that will control amount of light that hits the sensor.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.880
So the shutter will only open and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.465
close to get the right kind of light on to the sensor.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:30.700
Here you see an example of the mirror going up.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.290
When the mirror moves up, of course, all the light goes and hits the sensor.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.600
And above is where the whole eyepiece pentaprism is, to make sure that we can

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.590
see exactly what's actually going to hit the sensor after the mirror moves up.
