00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.680
We saw before that with a 15 decibel increase, our power is going to double 5

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.170
times. So, what does that actually mean? Well, it means if we have some power

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.240
P, we're going to double it, or multiply it by 2, and then do that again, and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:24.020
again, and again, and again. Which means we are multiplying P by 2, five times.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.703
That's the same as multiplying the power by 2 to the 5th power. And 2 to the

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:37.438
5th is 32. So that means that a 100 decibel sound is 32 times as powerful as an

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:39.540
85 decibel one.
