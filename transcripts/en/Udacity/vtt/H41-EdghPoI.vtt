00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.184
3x is our greatest common factor, and if we factored it out we would be left

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:08.980
with this expression. Amazing algebra skills if you got that right. This will be

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.146
the prime factorization for these three terms. We can see that 3x would be the

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:17.795
greatest common factor. If we multiply what's remaining we'll get 12x squared

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:22.248
for the first term, negative 5x for the second term, and negative 2 for the

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:23.063
third term.
