00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.440
I think the lines that make the contents of this

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.530
loop repeat exactly once for each digit are while n is

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.200
greater than 0. And, n gets updated to n over 10.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.620
Every time the code in these curly braces runs, n gets

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.750
integer divided by 10. So, whatever this last digit was, it

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.940
loses it. If n was 365, it loses the 5. If

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.730
it was 36, it loses the 6. Now, the code inside

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.410
of these braces runs over and over again, as long as

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.020
n is greater than zero. In other words, as long as n

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.020
has more digits. You could say that this line where we set n

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.030
is part of controlling the loop as well, since the size of

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.320
n effects when the loop stops. I would probably not say that the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.920
line int digit equals n mod 10 is part of running the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.160
loop once for each digit. This line doesn't change how many times the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.650
loop runs, it is related though because this is how we actually

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.910
get the digits one at a time so we can add them up.
