00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.176
Now that we have an equation for the profit Grant will make based on the number

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:08.495
of glasses cleaning sets he sells, I'd like to know what this 700, this constant

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.410
term at the end of the equation stands for in the context of Grant's money

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:16.409
making endeavors. Is this how many cleaning sets he has to sell in order to

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:21.475
break even? Just so you know, breaking even, means that profit equals zero. So

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:26.310
Grant doesn't make any money but he also doesn't lose any money. Or is 700 his

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:31.260
profit if he doesn't sell any glasses cleaning sets? Is it his lunch budget for

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:36.165
the month? His profit for every extra glasses cleaning set he sells? Or is 700

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:40.905
the cost of one glasses cleaning set? Please pick what you think is the best

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:41.350
answer.
