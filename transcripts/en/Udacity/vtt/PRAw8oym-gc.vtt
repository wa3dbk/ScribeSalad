00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.441
let's trace the code to find the answer. If the price is 95, then the

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:07.657
originalPrice is less than 100, so it'll skip the first part of the if and go

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:12.286
into the else. The discountedPrice will be the originalPrice, 95 minus 10. If

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:18.264
the original price is 100, 100 is still not greater than 100, so we still go

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:26.508
into the else. And get original price minus 10. If the original price was 105

00:00:26.508 --> 00:00:33.052
though, 105 is greater than 100. So we day, discounted price is the original

00:00:33.052 --> 00:00:38.243
price minus 20. And we get 85.
