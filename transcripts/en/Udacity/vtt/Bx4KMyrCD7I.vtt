For the rest of the nanodegree, you're
going to be using Google App Engine&lrm;.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.660
Now this is an amazing tool, but

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.240
it can be really frustrating
to get it up and running.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.610
This is often the case in programming,
and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.800
there's no real shortcut,
you kind of just have to figure it out.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.420
And we're going to do our best to
provide you with the most up to date

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.480
instructions.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.440
But even those may not be enough.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.980
So if you run into any problems,
persevere and remember

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.220
soon you're going to have a web page
that you can share with your friends.
