00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.300
The next concept that you need to understand is the concept of classes. Look at

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.050
these dates. Here we have a date, the date of the Mariner 4 spacecraft launch,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.960
another date that happens to be the inauguration of FD Roosevelt. And a third

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.660
date, the date of the first lunar landing. Now, all of these objects have

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.960
something in common. They all day objects. In Java, objects that have common

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.970
behavior are collected into classes. So the day class is the class that

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.580
contains all of the day objects. And the reason you want to know about this is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.500
when you want to find out something about how days work. You will want to look

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.450
at the documentation of the day class. It tells you what everyday object it is.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.760
Let me give you another example of a class. Here is a string object, and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.670
another, and another. All these string objects have something in common. They

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.630
all have the same behavior. And in Java, the String class defines what their

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.064
common behavior is. You will learn a lot more about the String class in this

00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:12.740
lesson. Let's go back to our day class for a minute, and think a bit more what

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.830
it means for objects to have common behavior. It means that they can all do the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.520
same kinds of things. Like what can they do? As you've seen when you played

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.350
with days and BlueJ, any day object let's you get the month, get the year or add

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.980
days to itself. These actions are called the Methods of the Day class. They are

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.270
the kinds of things that you can apply to day objects to achieve some kind of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.890
functionality. The word method, sounds a bit strange at first, and you should

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.490
just think of it as terminology. It's just where one calls the actions that you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.939
can apply to any of the day objects.
