00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.851
So we just solve this inequality to come up with an interval of solutions for x.

00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:09.378
Negative 45 is less than or equal is less than or equal to 10. So to satisfy

00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:14.262
this inequality x can take on any values from negative 45 to ten, including both

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:19.021
of those values. But remember, we're not just dealing with any numbers here.

00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:23.777
We're talking about Grant's expo booth. Remember that x is equal to the length

00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:28.472
that Grant should add to the booth dimensions in each direction. So my question

00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:33.230
is, does this solution make complete sense in the context of Grant's expo booth?
