00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.680
So today we talked about the broad process of case-based reasoning. Learning by

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.810
recording cases gave us a method for case retrieval called nearest neighbor

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.386
method. So we went ahead and jumped into the adaptation phase. Given an old

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.723
solution to a problem, how do we adapt that old solution to a new problem?

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:17.612
We talked about three ways of doing that. We can do it by model of the world,

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:21.070
we can do it by rules, or we can do it by recursion. Then once we've

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.960
adapted that old case, how do we then evaluate how good it was for

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.610
our problem? Then after we evaluated how good it is we looked at storing it

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.511
back in our memory. We want to build up a case library of past solutions, so

00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:35.428
if we've solved a new problem we will now sort that back into our case library.

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:38.272
Then based on that we revisited the notion of case retrieval.

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.967
Based on how our case library is organized, how do we retrieve a prior case

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:45.620
that's most similar to our new problem? Now there are a lot of open issues here.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.206
For example, should we store failed cases? Should we store failed adaptations?

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:52.900
Do we want to store them so we can avoid failing in the future? Should we ever

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.290
forget cases? Can our case library ever get so big that it's intractable, and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.340
we can't really use it efficiently? Should we abstract over cases, so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.360
should we use these individual cases to develop a more abstract understanding of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.920
a concept, or should we stick the individual cases and adapt them from there?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.880
If you're interested in these questions you can over to our forums and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.630
we'll talk about it there.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.320
But we'll also be revisiting these questions throughout the rest of the course.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.440
Next time we'll talk about incremental concept learning, which takes individual

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.442
cases and abstracts over them to learn some kind of higher level concepts.
