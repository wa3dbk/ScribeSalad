00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.400
Okay, you should be getting the idea now that the state charts are quite

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.660
powerful. There's lot's to them, like the class, diagrams, you don't have to

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.830
necessarily use all those features in every diagram that you do. How, in fact,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.380
do these state charts relate to the class model diagrams? Well the way to think

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.700
about it is, that each of the classes. In the class model diagram,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.260
has attributes, and those attributes form a state space. But

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.659
each of the classes in the state diagram could have it's own, state chart. And

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.810
that doesn't mean you're going to be building state charts for

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.460
each of the classes because, most of the classes have relatively simple states,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.160
and are, perfectly well described by the methods manipulating the attributes of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.490
that class. In th state charts, there's references to attributes.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.930
Those are the attributes of the class. There's also

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.840
references to actions and activities, and those are the methods of the class.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.489
The events in the state chart diagrams are going to correspond to signals.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.350
A signal is a dependency in the class model diagram. You can use a stereotype,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.360
in this case the stereotype is send, indicate that the move,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.280
movement agent class, is going to send a signal, called the collision signal.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.470
There's a dependency between those two two classes. So what this is saying is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.500
that, as you're doing your state chart modeling, you have to make sure,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.380
that it's consistent with respect to the class model diagram. That is,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.640
the events have to be named, the attribute names have to be,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.990
correct, the method names have to be correct, and so on.
