00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.920
Let's go ahead and
create a new Android project and

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.540
then have a look at
the default build scripts.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.650
We'll give our app a domain and
a location.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.460
We'll set a main SDK and we'll add
a blank activity with a fragment.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.810
We'll leave the defaults for
the fragment.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.400
So here we are in our
newly created Android app.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.730
If we go ahead and
haul out the ancient test device and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.860
then run our application,
let's see what happens.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.400
All right sweet,
looks like we're up and running.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.090
So let's dive into what gradle
configuration is present by default.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.720
Again the project pain has defaulted
to this Android centric setup.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.850
But I find this kind of confusing so
I'm going to switch back to the project

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.680
to just show the straight
up project layout.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.807
So here's our project and
here's our build.gradle file.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.370
There's a whole lot going on in
the default Android build scripts.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.280
For starters this is actually
a multi project build.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.130
An Android app itself as a sub project.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.450
We'll talk all about multi
project builds in lesson four but

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.150
it set up this way so it's easy to add
other sub projects that we want to

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.260
build together with the app like
libraries or even a backend.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.800
There are two things to notice
in this route build script.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.450
First we declare a build
script dependency

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.260
on com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.2.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.080
There are two things to
note in this build script.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.210
First, we declare a build script
dependency on this artifact coordinate.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.040
This is where the Android plug in for
where gradle lives.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.360
Second, and we'll talk about this
part of the gradle API soon.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.120
But this block adds the jcenter
repository to every sub

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.640
project of this build.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.410
That means every sub project can
just declare dependencies and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.240
they'll automatically be
retrieved from jcenter.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.120
Now let's take a look at
the build scripts specifically for

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.950
the android build.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.350
Which is in the app directory.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.200
So here's the build script for
the Android app.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.285
Note that first applies the Android
plugin which it fetched from jcenter.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.210
All configuration happens in
the Android configuration block.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.190
All that's absolutely required are the
first two lines defining the SDK version

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.165
and the buildtoolsversion.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.620
The default configured block, configures
attributes of the Android manifest.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.520
We'll talk about the build
type’s block momentarily.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.038
Finally the dependencies block
works just like java dependencies.

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:16.500
This declares the compile time
dependencies on every jar in the libs

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.670
directory and
on the Android support library.
