00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now, we're going to look at the solution to this final problem set for Unit 1.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The first thing we have to do is fill in the definition for the acceleration function.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now the acceleration function takes an argument that we've called spaceship position.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Well, we can define the position of the spaceship in relation to earth with this variable vector to earth.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A vector pointing from the earth to the spaceship is just the opposite

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
of a vector pointing from the spaceship to the earth.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we define vector to earth as the negative of this argument, spaceship position.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now since we're trying to define the acceleration,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
what we want to return is an expression for acceleration.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So we rate return and then a translation of this equation over here that we talked about earlier.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So we have the gravitational constant which is G times the earth mass which is mE,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
divided by this expression that looks pretty tricky, so let's dissect that briefly.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, the first thing we have right here is a method from a linear algebra library

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which gives us the norm or the magnitude of whatever vector we put into it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We, of course, are inputting the vector from the spaceship to the earth.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now over here, we can see in the original equation that the denominator

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is just the norm of that vector squared.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Within the code, we have it to the 3rd power.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, the reason for this is that we are also multiplying by that same vector again.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Whereas in the equation we're multiplying by the unit vector.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This means that in the Python version of the equation,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we effectively have the magnitude cubed in the denominator

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and the magnitude to the 1st power, the numerator which gives overall

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a factor of 1 over the magnitude squared which is exactly what we see in the original equation.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This makes our job a little bit easier because we don't have to define

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
a unit vector for the vector to earth.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now we move on to the definition of the function ship trajectory.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Since we gave you all of this code, we skip down here to this final for loop.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is something that we've seen several times before.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
For example, in the last problem set these two lines implement the Forward Euler Method

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to show how position and velocity are going to change with each step.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Once we have all of this code filled in, we can run the program, and our final product is this picture.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now this picture looks a lot like what we would expect from elliptical orbit.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We have the earth here and the spaceship moving around it.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Now everything looks pretty normal until we get almost to the end

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and we realized the ellipse actually won't close.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is a great example of how the Forward Euler Method is a method using approximations.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
If we are using more exact expressions for position and velocity,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
then we would end up with a closed ellipse and we can also play with the number of steps that we used

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to show how increasing the steps gives us a more exact approximation

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of the trajectory of the spaceship.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now we've done something that I think is pretty cool right here.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We've changed the number of steps from 13,000 to 1.3 million.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This means that since we cut the step size the same,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this picture shows what the position of the spaceship would be like

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
after much more time has passed after it has gone through many, many orbits.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So even though in that initial orbit, the trajectory only seems slightly off.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
If we let that happen over and over and over again,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
eventually the spaceship will be much further away from earth than it was originally.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Now, just to play with this example a little bit more, we've gone in and first change the step size,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
so that's 1/10 of the size that it used to be.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This should give us a much more exact approximation

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
since we're taking steps more closely together.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
However, we've also had to change the number of steps from the original 13,000 up to 130,000,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
so that we still have the same number of seconds total that the spaceship is in orbit

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which is a result of this changed code.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
At first, it might look pretty similar to what we had after we ran the program the first time.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
However, if you'd examine the end of the trajectory a little bit more closely,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
you can see that this tail looks like it's actually going to intersect the beginning.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This time, it actually looks like the ellipse might close

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
which we remember is what the trajectory in real life would look like.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
This is a great example of how changing the step size and using the Forward Euler Method

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
can greatly decrease the error and the results we produce.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
In the next unit, we'll look at another numerical method

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that deals with similar situations but in a slightly different way.
