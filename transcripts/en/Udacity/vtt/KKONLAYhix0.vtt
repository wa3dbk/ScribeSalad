00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.900
So now I have a few questions for you. And so we use, as

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.350
usual, our developer Janet to introduce a quiz. And the first question I want to

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.710
ask you is the following. A call to double passing three as a parameter returns

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.149
the value nine. What is this? Is that a failure, a fault, or an error?
