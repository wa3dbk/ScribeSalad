00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.494
The key thing to remember is point slope form. If we understand the equation for

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:08.703
slope then we know point slope form. We can fix one of the points to be x and y

00:00:08.703 --> 00:00:13.120
and then we just plug in another point once we know the slope. This can lead us

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.098
to the equation.
