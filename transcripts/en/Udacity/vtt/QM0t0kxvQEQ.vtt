00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So by this point, we've totally conquered Ambiguity, right?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Ah--not so right.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Even if I know whether an operation

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is Left or Right Associative,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm still not sure, when there are multiple operations, which one to do first.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I could do the Multiplication first,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and get: 8 + 6 is 14

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
or I could do the Addition first,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and get: 2 * 10 is 20.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This isn't the same problem as associativity

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
because it's not about whether we're associating to the Left or the Right,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it's about the--sort of the precedence of these Operators.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which one is more important,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which one should I deal with first--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which one binds more tightly.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In Standard mathematics, we'd want to do the multiplication first.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Multiplication has higher precedence than Addition.

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It gets serviced first.
