00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's get animating, putting something in the render method to at last make our

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.340
drinking bird move. I've gotten things ready by structuring the geometry a bit.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.298
The bird has two parts, the support, which is the legs and feet, and the

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:15.998
animated part, which is the body and head. I've put the body and head into a

00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:21.379
new Object3D called bodyhead. Next I do a thing that javascript allows. I

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:26.080
create a new parameter for the bird called animated, which I set to bodyhead.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.853
In this case, I want to access the animated part of the bird in the render

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:33.266
function, so for convenience I give it a separate parameter. Adding parameters

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.940
at any time to an object is a feature of javascript. That said, it can also be

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.490
a bit annoying at times. For example, if I try to set a parameter and make a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.510
small spelling error, I'm not told that the parameter didn't previously exist.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.811
I could also create what I think is a new name, only to find later that I'm

00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:52.131
actually using an existing parameter. Long and short, be careful. Usually

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.106
you'll find the error eventually, but the word there is eventually. Here's

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:59.319
where the animation happens, we want to rotate the body around its z axis, the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.650
axis of the crossbar. There's a variable called tiltDirection that's either one

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.090
or negative one. If It's one, then the rotation will increase by a small

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.584
increment, half a degree per render. When the angle reaches a maximum of 103

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:14.733
degrees, the object swings back the other direction by changing tilt direction

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:19.872
to negative one. Whatever amount the bird has moved past 103 degrees is used to

00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:24.208
move it the other way. Now the rotation angle is decremented by half a degree,

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:27.184
until a limit of negative 22 degrees is reached, which causes it to reverse

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:31.426
again. What we'd like to see is this result, with the drinking bird rotating

00:01:31.426 --> 00:01:35.924
around its crossbar, forward and back. We get this instead, with the drinking

00:01:35.924 --> 00:01:39.359
bird rotating around the origin. The problem is that we haven't set the body of

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.089
the bird to have a pivot point that is where the crossbar is located.
