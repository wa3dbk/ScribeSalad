00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.000
One way of composing policies is to

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.100
perform both operations simultaneously. For example, one might

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.910
want to forward traffic but also count how

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.910
much traffic is being forwarded. Both of those

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.670
operations can be performed in parallel. Another

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.130
way of composing policies is in sequence. Sequential

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.860
composition performs one operation then the next. For

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.420
example, we might want to implement a firewall.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.680
And whatever traffic makes it though the firewall

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.800
might then be subjected to the switching policy.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.100
One example of sequential composition, might be a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.930
load balancer. In this example, a policy might

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.040
take some traffic coming from, half of the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.140
source IP addresses, and rewrite that to one

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.220
server replica and take the other half of

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.870
the traffic and rewrite it to the other replica.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.920
After the load balancer rewrites the destination

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.000
IP address, we need a routing module to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.010
forward the traffic out the appropriate port on

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.030
the switch. In this case, we've used sequential

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.400
composition to first apply a load balance policy

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.270
that rewrites the destination IP address based on

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.200
the source IP address where the traffic is

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.600
coming from and sequentially apply a routing policy

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.300
that forwards the traffic out the appropriate

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.290
port. Depending on the resulting destination IP

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.670
address after that rewrite has taken place. Notice that we can use predicates to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.620
specify which traffic traverses which modules. Those

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.260
predicates can apply specific actions based on

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.940
things like the input port and the packet header fields. The ability to compose

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.500
policies in this fashion allows each module

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.860
to partially specify functionality without having to write

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.260
the policy for the entire network. This

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.000
leaves some flexibility so that one module can

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.750
implement a small bit of the network

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.470
function, leaving some functions for other modules. This

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.940
also allows for module re-use, since a module need not be tied to a particular

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.758
network setting. For example, in this particular

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:12.880
example where we've applied that load balancer

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.910
followed by routing, the load balancer spreads

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.740
traffic across the replicas without regard to the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.370
underlying network paths that traffic takes once

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.210
those destination IP addresses are rewritten. In summary,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.070
we've covered two concepts. One is the notion of a Northbound API, which sits on

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.750
top of an SDN controller and provides and exposes higher level abstractions that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.060
allows the operator or programmer to write policies without regard to how open

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.490
flow rules eventually get installed. We've

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.700
also talked about two different composition operators.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.920
Parallel composition and sequential composition, which specify

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.990
how individual simpler policies can be composed

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.100
to implement more complex network applications, thus allowing different SDN

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.550
control programs to independently perform tasks on the same traffic.
