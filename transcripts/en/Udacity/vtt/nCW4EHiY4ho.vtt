Let us do an exercise together. On the left again is a spectrum from very formal

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.809
to less formal. In the right here are six concepts. Inspirational, reptile,

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.180
foo. Foo here is the same concept that we came across when we're talking about

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.450
incremental concept learning. This is the same foo here. Right triangle,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.201
holiday, saltiness. Can you rank the six concepts according to

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:26.830
the notion of formality that we have studied so far?
