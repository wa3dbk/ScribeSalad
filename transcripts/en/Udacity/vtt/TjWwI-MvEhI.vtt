00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.130
So let's test our new hash function. See if it does

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.300
better than the bad string hash function we defined earlier. We're going

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.200
to use the same test_hash_function we defined before, that

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.430
takes the function as input. So we can pass in either the

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.239
original bad string hash function, or the new hash string function

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.110
that we hope will work better. A list of keys, and the

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.620
size, computing the hash size value for each key. And, records

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.170
how many end up in each position. So let's try that again,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.390
we'll use the same example we had before using

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.950
the words from Sherlock Holmes. And so we'll initialize

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.830
words, as all with words in the page that

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.020
is the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, that we load

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.880
from the Web. So, first we'll try this again

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.450
with the old hash function, bad string hash, and

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.040
obtain the counts, and let's print those out, remember

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.580
what those look like. So it's a pretty bad distribution,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.580
as we saw before, ranging from 725 all the way up to over 2,000, in one

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.348
bucket. Now, let's try it with the new

00:00:59.348 --> 00:01:05.040
hash function, instead of bad_hash_string. We'll path in

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.760
plain hash string. We're using the same words,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.070
the same number of buckets. And we'll see

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.720
the distribution now. It looks a lot better,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.450
right. There's no values under a thousand now,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.960
there's no values over the highest one would be 1,363

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.740
in the first bucket. So, let's look at that graphically.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.590
Here's what we had before. With a bad hash string

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.090
function we can see the size of the buckets varies a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.970
great deal. And we have the red and blue bars

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.250
showing some that are too popular, some that are not popular

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.950
enough. With the new hash function we have much less

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.990
variance. Still not perfect. We'd like to have all the bars

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.230
really be as close to the same as possible, but it's really

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.550
close. So this is working pretty well. The other thing we can

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.900
try is having more buckets. So let's try this one, we are

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.570
doing the same thing but this time with a 100 buckets instead of

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.990
12 buckets. And we can print that out, and so we see

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.910
the results when we have 100 buckets, are pretty good, but certainly

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.306
not perfect. We have buckets as small as this one, that has

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:06.890
a 104, and as larger, this one that has a 197. So almost

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.008
twice the size of the smallest bucket. It's certainly a hard

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.750
problem to build a better hash function. People put a lot of

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.670
effort into building good hash functions. As your tables get larger,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.410
it's very important to both have the hash function be efficient. Our

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.580
hash string function is not that great, because it does take

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.740
a long time to execute. If the string gets longer we have

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.510
to go through that loop once for each character. And so there

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.940
are better hash functions available. We're not going to look at those

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.010
in more detail now. But there'll be some links on the website to documents about

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.330
more interesting hash functions. This is going to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.800
work well enough for us though. So before

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.360
we go on to actually implementing in a hash table. We're going to have one quiz

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.640
to make sure that you understand, why this

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.790
is so much better than the original index.
