00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.745
So, according to multiple intelligence theory, there's a lot of different forms

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:06.365
of intelligence. But, is there any evidence to actually support this?

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:09.677
&gt;&gt; Yes, there is. In fact, some of the strongest evidence to support Gardner's

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:14.538
theory of multiple intelligences comes from savants. And savants are people who

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:18.378
have uncanny cognitive ability and at the same time, uncanny cognitive

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:23.955
disability. So for instance, they might be able to remember things, calculate

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:28.928
things or have incredible musical talent. And yet at the same time, they really

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:34.082
have other cognitive disabilities. So we'll be talking more about this later on

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:38.067
in the lesson. But the thing to take away right now is the fact that this

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:43.890
mismatch between cognitive ability and disability supports Gardner's theory.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.372
Other evidence suggests that there is something in between. This intelligence

00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:51.480
says one thing or intelligence is as many things.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.443
&gt;&gt; Are you talking about the Catal Horrell theory of intelligence?

00:00:54.443 --> 00:00:55.109
&gt;&gt; Yes I am.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.864
&gt;&gt; I think I'm going to go explain that now.
