00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.138
In this lesson, we are going to continue using the lowest common denominator to

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:08.830
help us simplify expressions. The lowest common denominator or LCD has

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.568
tremendous power. We're going to use it again to help us simplify complex

00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:17.685
fractions. A fraction like this one. I'll guide you through the questions you

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:21.615
want to ask yourself to simplify a fraction like this. To get started, we want

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:25.990
to find the lowest common denominator of all the internal fractions of our

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.943
complex fraction. Complex fractions, like this one, have fractions either in the

00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:35.642
numerator or in the denominator, or in this case, both. So, let's start our path

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:41.090
to try and simplify this crazy looking thing. What do you think is the LCD for

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.613
the denominators x, 4, and 8. Write your answer here.
