00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.770
Returning to the previous safe_insert example, let's demonstrate how to

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.560
use new techniques making the operation safe_insert actually safe.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.206
Just like in the threads creation code we have threads T0 and

00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:17.890
T1 and they both want to perform the safe_insert operation.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.228
The parent thread T0 wants to perform safe_insert with an element 6, and

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:26.320
the child thread wants to perform safe_insert with a value of 4.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.180
Let's assume that once the parent created the child T1

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.130
it continued executing and was the first one to reach safe_insert with value 6.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.500
It will acquire the log and start inserting the element 6 on the list.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.070
What that means, T0 has the log and when T1, the child,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.530
reaches the safe_insert operation it will try to acquire the lock as well and

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.720
it will not be successful it will be blocked.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.730
At some later point, T0 will release the lock, T1 will acquire the lock, and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.480
then T1 will be able to insert its element onto the front of the list.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.070
So in this case, the final ordering of the list will be 4 followed by 6.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.780
Since we're always inserting in the front of the list.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.430
That's how we describe this operation.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.200
So, the parent inserted its element first, and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.370
then the child thread was the second one to insert the value 4 into the list.
