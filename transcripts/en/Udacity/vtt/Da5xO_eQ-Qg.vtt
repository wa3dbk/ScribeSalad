00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.860
So this compare and swap instruction is going

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.110
to return true if it found that L and

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.600
me, that first two arguments, are the same and

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.620
therefore it set L to the third argument, in

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.900
that case, it's a success and success is

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.450
indicated by a true being returned by the operation.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.540
But on the other hand, if the comparison failed,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.150
it won't do the swap. It'll simply return false.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.970
So it won't do the swap, but it'll return

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.700
false. So that's the semantic of this particular instruction. Again,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.885
this is an atomic instruction. And this atomic instruction

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.540
maybe available in the architecture. But if it isn't, then

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.730
you have to simulate it using test and set

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.110
instruction. So in this particular example that I am showing

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.410
you, when I try to do this unlock operation

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.975
because this new guy has come in and he's executing,

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:54.850
he's halfway through executing his lock algorithm. So he has done

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.560
the fetch and store and, and he's going to set up the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.550
list so that my next pointer will point to him. So

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.379
that's the process that he's in right now. So at that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.510
point, I'm coming in, I'm saying, well, I want to do

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.270
the unlock operation, and that's when I found that my next

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.620
pointer is nil. And so what I have to do is,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.370
do this compare and swap, and at the compare and swap,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.460
now it's going to return to me false, indicating that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.590
this particular operation failed. So once I know that this

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.340
operation has failed, then I'm going to spin. And so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.310
the semantic of the unlock call is, I come in,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.480
remove myself from L. And in order to do

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.630
that, I'm going to do this compare and swap on the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.270
linked list. And if I find that the compare and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.390
swap instruction fails, I'm going to spin. Now what am I

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.870
spinning on? When will it become not nil? So basically

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.260
what I'm going to do is I'm going to spin on

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.840
my next pointer, being not nil. So right now it's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.880
nil. That's the reason that I think that there's nobody

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.350
after me. I was going to set this guy to nil.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.180
But I know that compare and swap fail and therefore

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.290
I know that there's a request information and I'm going to

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.130
spin waiting for my next pointer to become not nil.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.538
Now when will my next pointer become not nill? Remember

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:13.190
that this guy the new guy that is doing this

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.850
lock operations doing exactly what I did earlier. Right? And,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.080
and what he's doing is he's gotten my coordinates and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.740
he is in the process of setting it up, so

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.000
that my next pointer's going to point to him. So, eventually,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.520
he'll complete that operation. So my spinning is on this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.190
becoming not nil and it'll become not nil because of this

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.380
new guy completing what he needs to do as

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.910
part of this, lock operation. And, so, eventually the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.480
next pointer in, in my note will point to him and at that point I can come out

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.490
of my spin loop. Now, I'm ready to signal

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.620
the successor that hey, you got the lock. So,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.590
that's how I can make sure that when we

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.290
unlock the corner case that occurs during unlock and that

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.520
is there is no requesters after me, I can take

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.270
care of that by doing this atomic and ensuring that

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.220
there's no race condition between me the unlocker and a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.240
new requester that is in the process of forming through this

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.040
lock call. So once this lock data structure has been

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.180
fixed up nicely by this new requester, so far as

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.310
I'm concerned, everything is good. I can, the list is

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.530
good, and therefore I can go ahead and signal the next

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.800
guy that he's got the lock and be done with it.
