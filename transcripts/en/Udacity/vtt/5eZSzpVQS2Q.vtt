00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer is 60 and it turns out the uncertainties

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
from both of these experiments just add up.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The second one is very non-trivial. I'm not going to prove it to you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There's a proof in my book that takes marginal pages, but it is interesting to see

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
when you add Gaussian variables, the means add up and the variance add up.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The important to this standard deviation is don't add up.
