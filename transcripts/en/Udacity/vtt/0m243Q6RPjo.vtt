00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Somewhat orthogonal to unit testing, integration testing, and system testing

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is a testing technique called differential testing.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In differential testing what we're doing is taking the same test input,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
delivering it to 2 different implementations of the software under test,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and comparing them for equality.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Differential testing is extremely powerful in the case where we have multiple versions.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Stress testing is a kind of testing where a system is tested

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
at or beyond its normal usage limits, and it's probably best described

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
through a couple of examples.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For example, with the square root function that we were talking about earlier

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we might test it with very large numbers or very tiny numbers.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For an operating system we might test it by making a huge number of system calls

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or by making very large memory allocations or by creating

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
extremely large files.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
For a web server we could stress test it by making many requests,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
or even better, by making many requests, all of which require

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the database to communicate with its back end.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Stress testing is typically done to assess the robustness

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and reliability of the software under test.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And finally, we have what might be my favorite kind of testing, random testing.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In random testing we use the results of a pseudo-random number generator

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to randomly create test inputs, and we deliver those to the system under test.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And sometimes we're just feeding raw, random bits to the software under test,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but very often this can be much more subtle and more sophisticated

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
than just throwing random bits at the software.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And random testing is very often useful for finding corner cases 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in software systems, and the crashme program for Linux and other Unix kernels

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that we talked about earlier is a great example of a random tester,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and we'll talk about more examples later on in this course.
