The best answer of these five choices is the third one. An equation is two

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:08.045
expressions that have been set equal to one another. Although this second

00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:12.465
choice, something that has an equals sign, is partially correct. There are more

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:16.655
things involved in creating an equation than just an equals sign. We'll talk

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.390
more about that in just a moment.
