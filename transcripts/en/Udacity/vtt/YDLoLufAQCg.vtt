00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.851
So, for example, what would the volume of the box be if these cut lengths, the

00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:09.660
distance x in our diagram, were 1 inch long? Well, since we know that the cut

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.607
size, x, is the input for our function, we will just calculate v of 1. And plug

00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:19.442
in 1 in the spot of x. After some simplification, we would see that the volume

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:24.130
of the box, measured in inches cubed, would be 15. That's pretty interesting,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.610
but one piece of information isn't enough to figure out what the best cut size

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.337
is. And remember, Athena wants to maximize the volume of her box. So let's try a

00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:38.008
few different values. So, I've already filled in the volume of the box that

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.564
would result if the cut size was 1 inch. And I'd like you to fill in the other

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:47.163
four volumes that are left over for the other 4 cut sizes that are left over.
