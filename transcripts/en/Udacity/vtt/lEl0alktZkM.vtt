Besides surveys controlled experiments are another important type of research.

00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:09.885
Imagine that the researchers are testing the effects of some sleep medication on

00:00:09.897 --> 00:00:14.835
a bunch of different people and that these people are random sample. This is as

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:19.690
oppose to the convenient sample in which people who are convenient to find are

00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:24.677
used in the study. Everyone receives a pill, but for some, the pill has

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.241
medication that supposedly helps you sleep, and for others it's inactive. The

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:35.855
pill looks the same for everybody, and the sample is randomly assigned to one of

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:41.361
the two types of pills. What do you think the purpose was for giving some of the

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:46.343
people in inactive pill? To make sure there are no side effects of the active

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:51.140
pill, to have a comparison group to those who took the active pill or to see if

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:55.674
the inactive pill can help people sleep.Which do you think the purpose was?
