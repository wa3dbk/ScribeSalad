00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.700
What are the systems issues, in managing

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.910
large data centers? How do you program big

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.190
data applications, such as search engines, to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.870
run on massively large clusters? How do you

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.160
store and disseminate content on the web,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.050
in a scalable manner? Hello and welcome back.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.710
These are the kinds of the questions we will be addressing in this module of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.930
the course. This is what we mean when we use the term internet scale computing.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.350
A comforting factor for you is that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.160
you already know the answer to these questions.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.400
We've learned through the previous lessons, most

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.240
of the techniques needed in constructing distributed services.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.760
What we're going to see in the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
upcoming lesson, is a hardening of the distributed

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.950
systems issues to handle scale on the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.360
order of thousands of processes and failures.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.680
It's not a question of if. It's a question of when a failure's going to happen.
