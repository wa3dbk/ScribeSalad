00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.100
To go over the mathematics
of both dilation and

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.430
erosion, we have to talk about something
called the structuring element, okay?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.040
The structuring element is a mask, okay?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.340
It's a shape that you're going
to use to do these operations.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.310
And, it can be any shape.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.190
For today, the shapes
are going to be ones and zeroes.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.940
They can also be ones, zeroes, and x's.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.850
And the x's are don't cares.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.370
But nothing we're going to talk about
today will, will involve don't care, so

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.640
I'm not going to talk about it.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.170
What's important about the shape is that
they all are defined with respect to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.940
sometimes called an anchor, or
reference point, or an origin, right?

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.450
And usually, not always,
usually that origin is in the middle

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
of whatever shape you're making use of,
okay?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.960
So given a structuring element,
we can define both dilation and erosion.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.230
So dilation is as follows.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.300
Basically, I've got some binary image,
B, okay?

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.480
And that's here.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.830
I've got a structuring element, S.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.330
And the structuring element
has to have an origin.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.040
Basically, what you do is,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.610
you're going to take this
dilation structuring element and

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.000
you're going to run it around here,
placing the origin at different places.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.030
And wherever you place it,
you're going to take the OR

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.690
of all of the ones in the structuring
element with the ones underneath it.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.130
And so what that means is if any of the
ones land, of the structuring element,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.965
land on a one in the binary image,
the aura of all that will be one.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:32.125
So, Arpin did this and he's very proud.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.667
So, there's my structure element, and
he, there he goes, [SOUND] very good.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:37.315
Cool.

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:39.795
All right?
So you basically run it all over, and

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:44.695
what the result of this, okay,
is this val, is thing here.

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:47.055
And let's just take a lot at that,
right?

00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:49.490
These are our two original ones.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.300
Okay.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.260
So when I put this structuring element
down here, like that, nothing was a one.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.780
In fact, as I slide it all along,
nothing is a one, so

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.190
those are all zeroes.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.000
Right?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.630
But when I put my structuring element
here, notice it overlaps there.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.470
Okay.
So this value which is the origin for

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.550
that first position, that gets a one.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.890
And as I slide it along, that's how
I get the, the, the rest of these.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.050
So that's dilation by
a particular shape.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.280
Now I'll tell you
sometimes you'll dilate by

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.240
sort of a funny shape like that.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.060
Usually your shape will be symmetric.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.560
Sometimes it will be
taller than it is wide

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.070
because you're trying to extend things
in one direction as opposed to another.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.667
But this cutout kind of thing
would be a little bit unusual.

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:36.667
In fact, here's a nice example.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:41.129
So here's a binary text and you can see
that there's white pixels but they've

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.249
got lots of, if, you know, if you take
a look at that m, you can see it's

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:50.000
kind of, bunch of little spots in there
that seem to have some holes in it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.270
So if I use a structuring
element that looks like this.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.930
That, essentially, says that if I touch
anybody to my right, left, up or, or

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.970
below, I want to turn on the pixel.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.880
And, when I do that, you get
the really much better result, right?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.320
I mean, it's much easier to read the one
on the left, the one on the right.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.270
The one on the right might be uglier,
okay, because it doesn't look so

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.670
crisp, but
there's no question about reading it.
