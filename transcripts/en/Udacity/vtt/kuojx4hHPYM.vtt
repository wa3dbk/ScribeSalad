00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here is that data after outlier removal.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I shifted by subtracting 50 from either dimension.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This goes from 50 to 120 even though it says 0 to 70.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The same is true over here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now we can see the guesses are more rational.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They seem to line up a little bit in linear fashion.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They are certainly increasing, which means people who guessed a high weight for me today

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
as in the vertical axis likely also guessed a high H for me last year.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The guesses aren't entirely random.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What I'm going to ask is how did the guesses this from last year in the horizontal axis

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
correlate with the guesses from this year.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm going to ask you what line best describes this data,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and we're going to compute this using the formulas we learned about in class.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Here is a quick quiz for you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If you look at that data between axes x and y,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I will assume that you calculate the correlation r,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but for now I want you to look at this and tell me

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
your best guess of r.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'll give you a couple of hypotheses— -1, 0.7, 0, +0.7, and +1.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
None of those is absolutely correct, but one of them is quite close.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I think you can figure out which one it is.

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check one of these five boxes--exactly one of those.
