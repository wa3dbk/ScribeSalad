00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.200
The four values produced are X, Y, Z and W. These are called homogeneous

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.350
coordinates and they're used for projection. What we do next with these

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.988
coordinate values is divide each value by the W of the coordinate. This is

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:16.152
called the prospective divide or homogeneous divide. So for our three test

00:00:16.152 --> 00:00:20.678
points we had a value such as 0, 0, negative 1, 1. Dividing by 1 is simple

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:26.192
enough. That gives us 0, 0, negative 1. We don't need to bother writing out the

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:31.070
W value in the results, since W divided by W will always equal 1. For our next

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.456
point, W is 11. Dividing all these coordinates by 11 gives 0, 1, 1. Our last

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:41.774
point is a little more interesting. Dividing through by W gives us 0, 0.67,

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:45.522
0.83. Here are plots of the original points and view space and their

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:49.971
corresponding new locations. Notice that the negative Z axis is pointing to the

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:54.314
right for the frustum, and the resulting axis is plus Z to the right. Look at

00:00:54.314 --> 00:00:57.545
what's happened with these points and where they're transformed. They started

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.476
inside or on the edge of our frustum. After the projection matrix is applied

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:04.804
and division by W is performed the resulting points are in normalized device

00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:07.872
coordinates, anything in the range negative 1 to 1 for X, Y and Z is in the

00:01:07.872 --> 00:01:13.072
visible view volume. Let's take another example to show what happens to three

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:17.678
objects that are the same size in world space but at different distances. When

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:20.492
we transform to normalized device coordinates the relative area of coverage of

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:24.360
the near plane stays the same. That is, the close object was half as high as

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.256
the screen in our frustum view and transforms to half the height in NDC space.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:32.966
The second object is farther away and shows up as smaller. The third object on

00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:36.494
the back of the frustum is indeed much smaller than the others in normalized

00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:40.920
device coordinates. You might have noticed an interesting thing has happened to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.157
the depth of the second object. It started in the middle but it's moved

00:01:44.157 --> 00:01:47.290
backwards. We'll talk more about that in a bit as it's important.
