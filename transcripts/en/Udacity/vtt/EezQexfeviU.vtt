&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, so clearly we haven't totally forgotten how to solve equations. That's

00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:08.760
awesome. It's going to help us a lot in algebra moving forward. Let's look at a

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.322
new equation. We have 3 over x minus 1 over 5 is equal to 7. Just like the last

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:17.738
example, we have two fractions, but this time there's not an x anywhere in the

00:00:17.738 --> 00:00:21.740
second fraction. We have two choices as I see it, or at least two choices in

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.763
terms of how to start the problem. The first choice that I see is the first step

00:00:25.763 --> 00:00:29.667
we could take, would be to combine the two fractions that are on the left-hand

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:33.771
side. That's definitely an option. But there's another choice. We could isolate

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:37.187
the terms, or term in this case, involving x on the left-hand side and move

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:41.550
everything else over to the right-hand side. I have a feeling that it's going to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.795
be a little bit less work if we go with the second option. I'll put a link to

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:50.005
how to do the problem in the other way in the lesson notes. But for now, let's

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.281
go with this method. So our goal right off the bat is to get this term by itself

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:58.466
on the left-hand side. So for the equation that I want you to write in this box,

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:02.034
I would like you to isolate the term with x on the left-hand side. Get

00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:05.934
everything else on the right-hand side and simplify it so that it's written as

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.142
an improper fraction. What do you get then?
