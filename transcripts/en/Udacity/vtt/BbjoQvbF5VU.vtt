00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
The answer to that is we can find a group of four genes that are connected to each other

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.830
by selecting this one here, this one here, this one here, and this one here

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.980
and as you will see, this gene here is connected to those three.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.110
This gene here is connected to that one, that one, and that one.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.970
This one up here is also connected to this one, this one, and this one

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.070
and similarly here the fourth one is also connected to the other three.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.720
That is actually the largest possible group of genes that you can find

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.760
that are all connected to each other in this network.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.040
Now it should be noted that this problem is a bit of a simplification of what you might

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.360
encounter in a real biotechnology setting.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.190
For example, normally in biotechnology you would be happy if you found a group of genes where

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.850
most are connected to most others but here we'll be looking

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.710
only for groups that are fully connected to each other so like this one here.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.540
The reason why we're doing that is that from an algorithmic perceptive,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.950
it doesn't really make much difference and it's just simply to work with the problem

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.520
where we know we have to find groups of genes that are fully connected to each other

00:01:14.520 --> 99:59:59.000
rather than if we allow certain connections to be missing.
