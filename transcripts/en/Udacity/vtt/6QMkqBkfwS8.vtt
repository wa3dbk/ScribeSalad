00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're going to modify this rank algorithm that we had before to do what I suggested.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's going to return a kind of slightly sorted or less than the one that was given

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with regard to some value of v.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There is a lot of ways to do this some are cleaner and more efficient that others.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm going to do the way I'm doing it just to be simple.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a very simple idea all we're going to do is we're going to keep track of a list of values

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that are known to be smaller than v that are in L and the ones that are bigger than v.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We're going to loop through all the values.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Anytime we encounter one that's smaller than v, we put it in the smaller list.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Every time we find one that's bigger than v, we put it in the bigger list

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then we glue them altogether.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
First the smaller then v and the bigger. Now, this sort of plus equals a list construct.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's not immediately obvious what the running time of this is in Python.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In fact, I think its probably not constant time, but you can create a version

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
where each of these steps is constant time so that this entire routine runs in Î¸n

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
because all we're doing is we're touching each of the values in the list to construct a new list

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let's run this and see what it does. All right. It seems to be done.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Here is 84, and you'll notice that these are all the elements of the original list.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
84 is here. Everything to the right of it is bigger than 84.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Everything to the left of it is smaller than 84. So we partition the list around 84.
