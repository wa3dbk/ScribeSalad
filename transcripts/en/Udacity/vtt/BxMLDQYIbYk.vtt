I have a rendering algorithm question for you. Here are 4 different optical

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:09.070
illusions. Assume each object, in each of these scenes, is drawn separately.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.096
For example, each block or square, each brick, each ring, and each dot is a

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:17.490
separate object. Which of these scenes most definitely could not be rendered

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.550
with the basic painter's algorithm?
