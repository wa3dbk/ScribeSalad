00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.520
Now that we saw a number of refactorings, we also saw

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.950
how refactorings can be performed automatically within an ID, I'd like

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.230
to make you aware of some risks involved with the user

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.510
refactorings. Refactorings are a very powerful tool, but you also have to

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.820
be careful, first of all when you do more complex refactorings,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.540
you may also introduce subtle faults. What, we don't really call

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.040
regression errors. You might change something in the class. You might

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.140
think that that's a behavior preserving

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.200
transformation when considering the whole code,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.860
and instead your change is affecting the behavior of some of the

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.980
other parts of the code. So, it's introducing a regression that will cause

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.670
some other functionality, some other piece

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.320
of functionality some other feature, to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.190
work incorrectly. So you always have to be careful, and as we saw

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.750
at the beginning one way to avoid that is to run tests.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.080
Every time you make a refactoring every time you change your code and

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.280
refactor your code. So is to get the least some confidence in

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.540
the fact that your refactoring is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.290
indeed behavior preserving. Also consider the refactoring

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.680
should not. Be abused. Refactoring should be performed when it's needed. It's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.570
useful to improve the design of your code when you see problems

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.680
with the design of the code. Shouldn't just be applied for the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.720
final code because you can apply, for example, easily within a tool.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.030
So be careful not over doing it when you refactor. And for

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.310
the same reason that we mentioned at the beginning, you should be

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.600
particularly careful when you're using refactoring

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.290
for systems that are in production.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.260
Because if you introduce a problem, before the system goes in production,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.750
then you might be able to catch it earlier,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.780
with testing. Or before it's released. But, if you introduce

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.750
a problem for a system in production, then you have

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440
to issue a new version of the code. You'll be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.860
affecting, you might be affecting some users, because the code

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.050
fails on their machine. So, you have to be twice

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.190
as careful, when you are doing refactoring, when you're changing

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.010
your code for a system that is already in production.
