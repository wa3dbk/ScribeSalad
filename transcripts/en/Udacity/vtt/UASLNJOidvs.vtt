00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to the 5th office hours.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We had a lot of great questions on twiddle and parameter optimization.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's get started.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The first question comes from George.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He wants to know, first, is twiddle really all that good?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Does it really give better results than other methods you might use for selecting parameters?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, George, that's a great question.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's good in only one dimension, which is it's really easy to implement.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Sometimes people overlook this.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is an entire literature on search parameter optimization.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In a lot of cases where twiddle would fail other methods would succeed.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You can write a PhD thesis about this, but the nice thing is twiddle takes no time to implement,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and I've never seen a piece of code that couldn't be made better with a twiddle around it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That's why I explain it. I think it's just an easy method.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I literally use it all the time.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Another question from George about twiddle is local minima.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Are they a problem with twiddle? It seems like it's pretty easy to get caught in one.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That would be a fantastic final exam question.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Sorry for taking it out of the final exam.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Of course, it's susceptible to local minima.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's essentially a hill-climbing technique.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It might on occasion jump over because of the step size,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but by and large we're going down the hill.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's also can get stuck on ridges and other phenomena

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that might occur in certain optimization spaces.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It really good if you have a good guess for the initial parameters.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's pretty horrible if you want to search systematically.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Then you have to do things like grid search

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or a kin of particle filters as randomized methods for searching as well.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Matt wants to know how you can smooth a vehicle's path and still

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
guarantee that it's going to be collision free.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It seems like sometimes that new path will run into an obstacles you had previously avoided.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Matt, you're absolutely right and that's regrettable for the obstacle and the car.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It turns out that in practice the smoothing techniques

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that we use are a little bit more sophisticated.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That is, it's not just points in x-y space, but it's successive state vectors for cars.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The parameters from one to the next are the steering commands for the car,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and then you can actually often much better guarantee that you stay away from obstacles.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
There is still this issue of how to--obstacles are repellent,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and you have to put into your optimization terms

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
a constraint that expels you away from these obstacles.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
To be honest, this becomes a bit of a black art how to tune these parameters.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I had a PhD student work on very narrow openings with smoothing

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
where we used the distance between obstacles

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
as one way to scale the pressure that obstacles would assert

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
on the path to pull away from themselves.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The car would be able to go through very narrow passages

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
but in very wide passages wouldn't go straight to the middle of it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's a bit of a black art, and I'm really trying to scratch the surface here.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
All right. Lauren wants to know--in the unit we had this PID exercise where we were driving

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the car and trying to get it to align with this straight line at y equals zero.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He found that when halfway through his run he switched the target to y equals 2 instead

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
after the car had already gotten going along y equals zero pretty well, this went sort of haywire.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Do you have any idea what may have happened?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It seems like in reality a moving target is a pretty common thing to have in a car.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Don't do that. Don't do that with your own car. Okay? Your car will go haywire.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It turns out in a lot of controls there is something called the "basin of attraction."

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It says a controller, when you look at it mathematically, is only guaranteed to succeed,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we called this "stable," if it's initial set point, the distance and the angle and so on

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
from the reference trajectory, is confined in a specific area.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
If you were to analyze our controller, which happens to be a nice stable controller

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
so you can actually do this, you'll probably find that the set point

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
2 off is outside the basin of attraction, specifically if we have an integral term.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
That would be particularly bad.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
There are other ways to derail it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You could have the car face the wrong direction,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and I believe the car would produce something that you wouldn't expect.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
When you design the controller practically and theoretically it's useful

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to guarantee to yourself or convince yourself that you're within this basin of attraction

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
where the controller actually works.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I love the fact that you're running this experiment,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
because that's the kind of stuff that's really interesting to run.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I think it's much more interesting to break things than have things work,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
because we can understand where the boundaries are.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And you found one, and that's really, really great. I didn't even talk about this in class.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Thank you.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Next question comes from Omar.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
He's a high school student, and he's taking this course,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and he's going to be applying to colleges soon.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So Omar-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;No, go on. Any advice. Go for it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Omar, I'm your friend. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;That's it? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;No, go ahead with the question.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
He wants to know if you have any advice for projects he could tackle,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
hopefully, that would show college admissions committees how much he's learned in this class.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Omar, I'm your friend. Keep doing what you're doing.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
You have your life ahead of you, which is wonderful.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You're asking the right question. You're taking my class.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You are audacious to take this class. That's fantastic.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
All the high school students out there--you guys rock.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
In the Darpa Grand Challenge, one of the top competitors was a team from

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
southern California, a high school. What was the name? Palo Verdes, I believe.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It was mostly girls, it turns out, and they were all under the age of 17,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and they actually beat MIT out of the prelims in the Grand Challenge.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I was insanely impressed, and these students to the present day are actually my heroes.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
What can you do? There is a FIRST. My friend Dean came and started the competition.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It's a great way to be creative.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
There is Lego Mindstorms that you can play with and have a lot of fun with

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and be creative about it.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
There are all kinds of mathematics/robots olympiads

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
where people do hard problems, hard programming problems and so on.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The only thing I take issue with is I think we pay way too much attention

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to the admissions process and way too little attention to just having fun and learn something.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I have never worried about admission.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I ended up at Stanford because I couldn't decide and move on,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
so I got older and older and eventually became a professor.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I think the focus on having fun and exploring something new and learning something new

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to me is one that I wish you could maybe remember when you do this.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Because that's really the most important thing in life in my opinion.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
That's good advice, I think. Thank you.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
MJL talked about his own experiences driving a car and how his decisions on the road

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
don't just depend on where his car is and where he wants to go but also on how fast he's going.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
That's something we haven't talked about much,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
how to incorporate speed into robot decisions.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Coming from Germany we don't really worry about that--just kidding.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Absolutely correct, and there are multiple aspects to speed.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You bring up one--that is, if you take the same turning radius at a higher speed,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
your lateral acceleration goes up--your sideways acceleration.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Eventually your car will spin, flip, slide, or similar, but it won't work anymore.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So in our work on the Google car and the Stanford car,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
we put actually a limit on the level of acceleration and made that the thing.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It means on highways our turning radius is significantly larger than, say, on a parking lot.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
That's true for any human driver as well.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
The second part we didn't talk much about is selection of speed.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I didn't because the control methods are not quite

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
as interesting as the steering control methods.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Basically, you can imagine that you set the speed so that you can always come to a safe stop.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Every obstacle in your way, every pedestrian on the side, every car in front of you

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
puts a limit on the speed, as does, of course, the legal speed limit.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
In the controller is one that uses the throttle and the gas to gradually pull back,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
in a PID way actually, to the set speed that's the maximum legal speed

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
or drives at the speed given all these other constraints.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The lateral acceleration does impose on the maximum speed.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
When we know we have to drive a turn, we can compute where we do the acceleration

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
based on different speeds and then back propagate those into the equation for speed.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
That gives us a limit on speed as well.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Our car naturally slows down before turning.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Does that maximum lateral acceleration depend on things

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
like road condition, which I imagine it would?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
A slippery road would, of course, have an effect. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;It should. It should.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I hope so. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;I think it presently doesn't. It will in the future.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
We have a bit of a difficult time right now determining what the exact road conditions are,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
partially because we don't have access to

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the stability management systems on cars themselves,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
but it absolutely should, I agree.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Laurent asked another question about twiddle.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
This one's about correlated parameters.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It seems like with twiddle we're adjusting one parameter at a time.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
What if we have a situation where we need to change both of these parameters

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
or two of the three or three parameters to really get a better minimum?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
That's a fantastic question that a case where twiddle will just fail you.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
If you have a small diagonal ridge and two parameters to co-evolve,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
it'll just fail. There are fixes.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Again, there is an entire literature.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The easiest fixes, if you have happen to know the direction, the can twiddle in that direction.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
There is something called adaptive samplers that actually learn

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
about this direction dynamically and build gradients to follow.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
There are all kinds of other methods that look at the surface shape and model the surface shape

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and model the surface shape and find the optimal direction to go.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Again, twiddle was only given because it's so simple,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and I hope you found it to be very effective.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It was partially given because I couldn't figure out what the right control parameters are,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
so I just implemented this twiddle thing.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But yes, there are many, many ways to improve over twiddle.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Phillip points out that there's going to have to be some sort of time lag

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
between when you make your commands and when the car actually responds to them.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
How do you account for that time lag?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Phillip, that's a great question. This is what a lot of our time goes into.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
This is a really, really, really hard question.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
The time lag basically kills everything.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
If you take your car and control software, say, and you make a controller

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and then you add, say, a 10th of a unit of time delay in there.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Just try it out and pretend that you're always acting on the previous sensor measurement.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
You'll be amazed and how badly the car will drive,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
because it would constantly over steer and under steer.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The best method we have right now is to use a predictive controller,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
which is we have a model of the car.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
We know at what time the control command was issued,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
when the sensor measurement was taken, how much time the processing took,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and we kind of predict what the measurement would be at the time the processing is finished

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and then use this as an input.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
If you know about time delays in the vehicle itself to execute commands, you add this on.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
The second thing we do is actually model the car more detailed than I pretended.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
In the way I taught it it felt like we could set the steering wheel to any set point instantaneously

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
but a physical steering wheel has inertia.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Instead of modeling the set point, we have a secondary controller that understands

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
how much torque it takes to turn a steering wheel and uses that as its information.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
The better your model the more accurate your control. It takes some work to get it right.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Thank you. The last question comes from Martin.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
He wants to know what happens when the physical model

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that we're basing all of our decisions on changes?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
If the car gets a flat tire, or something along those lines, what happens?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
What happens to people? People are actually quite amazing.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
You can do the test yourself.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Pick up a box. You have no clue how heavy it is--someone puts a brick inside or not.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
You lift it, You can completely adjust the dynamics of your body--

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
the posture of your body--to be able to walk with it.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
If find this unbelievably amazing that we have this kind of intuition how to handle things,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and we really reconfigure our body.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Cars can do this to some extent.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
They can do it specifically if they have a model of the change.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
If they understand which way, say, a blown tire affects their dynamics.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
There has been a lot of work on this.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You can run multiple predictive models--one with a blown tire and one without a blown tire--

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and then when the one with the blown tire comes along,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
then this model all of a sudden becomes the more plausible to explain what's happening.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
That's kind of what people also do in a very, very fast way.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
They understand, well, I tried something that didn't quite work.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Then they correct for it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
PID controller is somewhat robust,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
like when we put the drift in the tire, there was a change like this.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
But yes, a blown tire will very quickly leverage the PID controller out

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
of the basin of attraction for stable control.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
As a result it could really happen that this thing flips.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
In reality the number of things that can happen to a car are quite enormous--

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
from the mattress on the highway all the way to the blown tire to the defective computer,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
which also effects the car.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I wouldn't claim we have solved this problem.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
We are really working on this at Google right now through these different situations

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
to make the situation as robust as possible.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
For me it's still an open problem how to control a car well

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and also notice that a tire is blown. Thanks for asking this question.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Thanks a lot for all the good questions. Thank you for helping to answer them.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Next week we're doing SLAM, I think.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We don't know what slamming is. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Whatever slamming is.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Who's being slammed? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;I don't know. I think--

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Slam, slam, slam, slam, slam. We're doing SLAM.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Come see the SLAM lecture.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I want to say a word that--we've started with many tens of thousands of students.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
There's still a huge number of students left,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
but when you're at this point and ask this level of question,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
you're a serious person. I totally appreciate this. This isn't an easy course.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
In fact, this course is really hard.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Thanks for asking such insightful questions.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I'm going to go back to the discussion forum and answer some more questions there.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I guess I'll see you in class. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;See you next week.
