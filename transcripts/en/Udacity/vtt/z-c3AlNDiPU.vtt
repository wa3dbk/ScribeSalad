00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.080
Now before we move to the last part of the lesson, let's

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.939
have a quick quiz on software process models to make sure that

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:06.640
we are all on the same page. So I am going to

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.320
ask you two questions. The first question is which of the following models

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.330
is most suitable to develop a software control system? And when you

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.700
think about the software control system, you can think about for example

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.150
the control system for the software in an airplane. Would you rather

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.860
use a pure waterfall model? Test

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.840
driven development? Or an evolutionary prototyping approach?
