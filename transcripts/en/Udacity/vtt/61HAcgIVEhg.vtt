00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When we answer these sorts of questions and make these types of calculations,

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:08.369
we're actually using algebra. We're creating and using linear equations. But in

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.682
algebra, we don't stop at the question, how much would 20 miles cost. We ask how

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:16.808
much would x miles cost. I want to know the cost of my truck rental for any of

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:21.167
the number of miles I drive it. So here's the big question. What expression can

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:25.187
we write here that represents the cost of our truck rental in terms of the

00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:29.411
number of miles we drove x? Try thinking about the pattern in this table, and

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:33.223
take some time. Don't worry if you don't know how to do this just yet. I want to

00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:36.970
get you thinking, and I want to try and give you a shot at it. Finally, when you

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.454
enter your answer, don't use the dollar sign. Just write the expression.
