Actually, all of these are good things to do,.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.160
You should prefetch and cache data to front load the

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.420
requests as much as possible. You should also eliminate,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.430
or at least reduce, periodic transfers like polling. Otherwise, you're

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.040
going to keep a continuous connection alive and you're

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.390
never going to let the cellular radio go into low

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.950
power idle mode. If you can, you should batch

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.700
those requests instead. Store up several requests and then grab

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.710
them as necessary.
