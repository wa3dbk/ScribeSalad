00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The question is: Can we do such a thing automatically?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The answer is yes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We can do so using Delta Debugging.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The idea is as follows.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
At a given location we extract the state for the failing run

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as well as for a passing run.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then we go and compare the states.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What we then get is a set of differences

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
between states found in the passing run and states found in the failing run

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for each single variable.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
With Delta Debugging, we can now find a minimal subset of these

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
differences that causes the passing run to fail.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This minimal subset then at the given location

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is the variable that causes the failure.
