00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:02.472
Alright, so I’ve redrawn the graph from the previous

00:00:02.472 --> 00:00:05.989
examples just to make a little bit more room and

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:10.116
what we’ve got so far is the original graph and the –

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:14.197
a tree version of the graph that we built by search,

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:16.328
some kind of data depth-first, breadth-first – any kind

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:19.277
of search actually will do, as long as we now have

00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:21.734
these green edges pointing downward and these red

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:25.781
no-tree edges connecting nodes that need to be

00:00:25.781 --> 00:00:28.838
connected if the edge wasn’t actually part of this

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:32.747
tree. Then we post ordered the nodes and now what

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:34.745
do we do next.We now compute the number of

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.611
descendents for each node in the graph and the

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:41.675
number of descendents is the number of nodes that

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.294
are either the node or reachable from the node by

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:48.630
following green edges only. So this is easiest to start

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.824
at the bottom here, F has just the node itself and no

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:54.638
descendants, so it’s got a number of descendant of

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:59.138
one, same thing with G.E has one descendant, one

00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:02.490
descendent plus itself for three. D has the three

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.601
descendants of E plus itself for four. C has the four

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:09.471
descendants of D plus itself is five. B has just itself

00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:14.893
and A has B’s descendants, C’s descendants plus

00:01:14.893 --> 00:01:17.101
itself for seven. So the next thing we’re going to

00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.380
compute is for each of the nodes, we’re going to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.674
consider the set of nodes that are descendants of

00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:26.415
the node or reachable from the descendants of the

00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:30.811
node by one hop of a non-tree edge and of all those

00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:32.812
nodes that are reachable, we’re going to look at the

00:01:32.812 --> 00:01:35.758
post-order value that is the smallest, we’ll call that L.

00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:39.362
So in the case of F, F has itself and it also can reach

00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:42.662
G, the smallest value there is two. G has no

00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:45.646
descendants but it can reach by one red edge F. So

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:49.709
the smallest least values two and three is two. E has

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.881
F and G and itself that it can reach no other nodes

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:53.768
by non-tree edges and the smallest of those

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:57.940
numbers is two. D can reach all of these nodes in

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.675
itself but also by a non-tree edge it can reach this

00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:04.477
node and the smallest of those numbers is one. C

00:02:04.477 --> 00:02:07.861
can reach all of these nodes and through one of

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:11.500
those nodes one tree edge gets it to one. B values

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.460
itself as one so that’s going to be the smallest. And

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.479
A includes everything, so that’s going to include the

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.177
one, so that’ll be the smallest. H is the same idea

00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:22.870
except of those that same set that we computed for

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.820
L, we want to know the largest value. For G between

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.569
F and G the largest value is three. For E between E,

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.615
F and G the largest value is four. For D, D,E,F, G

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:37.517
and B reachable by a red edge, the largest value is

00:02:37.517 --> 00:02:42.209
itself five. C same set for adding in C now and the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.885
largest value becomes six and A set contains

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:47.486
everybody so that’s going to include itself with the

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:49.751
value of seven. Alright, now we’ve decorated these

00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:52.801
nodes with lots of interesting numbers, now we can

00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.055
get to the last step. So given all these nicely

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:57.514
decorated nodes, we now have a rule for figuring out

00:02:57.514 --> 00:02:59.915
which ones are the bridge edges and this is the rule.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:03.309
All the bridge edges are ones that are green, they

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.980
have to be three edges and the green number is

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.926
less or equal black number and the red number is

00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:11.307
bigger than the blue number minus the black

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:15.656
number or in words the – each value has to be less

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:19.297
or equal to the post order value, the lowest value

00:03:19.297 --> 00:03:22.755
has to be bigger than the number of descendants

00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:25.265
minus the post order value. So apart from the fact

00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:27.949
that it’s not immediately obvious why this is the right

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.073
rule let’s apply it to the tree to see what gets picked

00:03:31.073 --> 00:03:32.801
out. So, what we’re doing here is we’re looking at

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.836
each green edge and we’re checking the numbers

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:37.937
on the downward part of the edge. So here is a

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:40.169
green edge and let’s look at the numbers here and

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.524
see if they fit the pattern. We need the green

00:03:42.524 --> 00:03:44.525
number to be less or equal to the black number. So

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.691
that doesn’t work, right. Here is another green edge.

00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:48.087
You need the green number to be less or equal to

00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:50.183
the black number, oh that works. So the red number

00:03:50.183 --> 00:03:51.977
needs to be bigger than the difference between the

00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:53.893
black and the blue. So black and the blue the

00:03:53.893 --> 00:03:56.241
difference is two. The red number is two, so that

00:03:56.241 --> 00:04:00.009
doesn’t work. Alright next edge to check is this one,

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.832
so we need to check is green less or equal to black,

00:04:02.832 --> 00:04:07.111
yes. Is red bigger than black minus blue? Two is

00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:10.758
bigger than one, so yes. So this edge has been

00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:13.429
identified as a tree edge. That’s the right answer and

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:15.366
none of the other edges are tree edges but let’s just

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:18.050
check them just to be sure. For this edge, we have –

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.314
we need green to be less or equal to black which we

00:04:20.314 --> 00:04:23.701
have. And we need red to be bigger than the

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:25.699
difference between blue and black but one is not

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.802
bigger than one, so this edge is out. How about this?

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:31.599
We need green less or equal to black, yes. We need

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.848
red bigger than the difference, no. Green number is

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:37.802
five because the D node is reachable by a non-tree

00:04:37.802 --> 00:04:40.436
edge. Alright, so green less or equal to black, no.

00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:42.534
Alright, well that’s it. Those are all the edges. So in

00:04:42.534 --> 00:04:45.010
this example anyway the one edge that the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.518
algorithm finds is exactly the bridge edge. Can we

00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:50.734
get a handle on why this works? It seems kind of

00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:54.734
magic at this point.
