00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.500
The second case is simliar to the common case,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.620
but the memory pressure on P is exacerbated in

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.109
this case. In this case, there's so much memory

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.570
pressure that all of the physical memory that's available at

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.320
P is being consumed by the working set, while

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.300
hosting all the applications running on host P. There's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.390
no community service happening on host P. And now,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.040
if there is another page fault, for some new page

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.940
on P, then there is no other option on

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.840
host P except to throw out some page from its

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.348
current working set in order to make room for

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:39.780
this missing page. So, we're going to do exactly similar

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.660
to what we did in the previous case, with

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.510
the only difference that the candidate that is being chosen

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.100
as a victim, or the replacement candidate, which is

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.750
called a victim, in the management of virtual memory system,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.790
is coming from the local part of host P itself. So we get the missing page

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.240
and we send out the oldest page from

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.820
local part of host P, recognizing that the local

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.280
part is zero right now. So in this case you can see that there is no change

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.180
in the distribution of local and global on

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.940
P, because global is already zero, it's not going

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.360
to be anything less than that. So the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.970
distribution remains unchanged. And as in the previous case,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.100
there's no change on host Q as well

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.510
in terms of the split between local and global.
