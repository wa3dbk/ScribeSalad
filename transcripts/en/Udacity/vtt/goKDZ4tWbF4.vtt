00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.390
So imagine that Kris Medlen from Atlanta Braves is the pitcher.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.220
And Martin Prado from Arizona Diamondbacks is at the bat.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.930
Kris Medlen has the goal of finishing the inning without allowing any runs.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.550
How does Kris Medlen decide on an action? We may conceptualize Medlen's decision

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.940
making like the following. Medlen may look at various choices that

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.730
are available to him. He may throw a pitch. Or he may choose to walk the batter.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.200
If he walks the batter, then there are additional possibilities that open up.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.710
He'll need to face the next batter. If he chooses to pitch, then he'll have to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.900
decide what kind of ball to throw. A slider, a fast ball, or a curve ball.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.050
If it was a slider, then there is a next set of possibilities open up.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.020
There might be a strike or a ball or a hit or he may just strike the batter out.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.570
Thus, Medlen is setting up a state space. Now, what we just did informally can

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.920
be stated formally. So, we can imagine a number of states in the states space.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.570
The state space is a combination of all the states that can be achieved by

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.160
applying various combinations of operators, starting from the initial state.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.270
Each state can be described in terms of some features, f1, f2,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.600
there could be more. Each feature can take on some values. For example, v1,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.150
there might be a range of values here. So initially, the picture is at state s0.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.910
And the pitcher wants to assume some state S101. And at a state S101

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.150
presumably the pitcher the pitcher's goal has been accomplished. So we may think

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.660
as the pitcher's decision making as some kind of a part of its current state to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.440
this particular goal state. This is an abstract space. The pitcher has not yet

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.280
made any action. The picture is still thinking. The picture is sitting up

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.492
an abstract state space in his mind and exploding that state space.
