What's great about division is we can always check our answer. We know division

00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:10.199
and multiplication are inverse operations of each other, so if I take my answer

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.957
4x to the 6 plus 6x to the 4th minus 3x squared and multipliy it by 2x, what we

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:19.993
were originally divided by, we should get our same polynomial. 2x Times 4x to

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:24.667
the 6 is 8x to the 7th, 2x times 6x to the 4th is 12x to the 5th And 2x times

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:30.091
negative 3x squared is negative 6x cubed, this is great. We know our polynomials

00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:34.389
match, so this must be the correct answer to our division problem.
