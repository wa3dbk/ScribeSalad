When we solved this equation, we got x equals negative 2. What's awesome about

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:08.216
math is that we can know we are right. We can substitute negative 2 in for x and

00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:12.212
check to see if the equation is true. It's like if we are seeing if the scales

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:16.291
are still balanced. To check to see if we are right, we take the value negative

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:20.231
2 and we plug it anywhere we see an x. Remember to use parentheses when

00:00:20.243 --> 00:00:24.286
substituting values, we don't want to make mistakes with negative signs. Now

00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:28.252
that we've plugged in negative 2 into our equation, we know that the left side

00:00:28.264 --> 00:00:32.299
should be equal to the right side. The equation should be balanced. So, here's

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.323
your skills check. What number should go into these boxes to check the answer?

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:39.694
Remember, the last boxes should be equal if we've done it right.
