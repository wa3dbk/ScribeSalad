00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.650
Starting at the top
with the Chrome logo,

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.440
it's pretty clear that it's
a set of colors, set of lines,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.880
set of gradients, and
some pretty regular shapes.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.890
In fact, if you open it up in DevTools,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.610
you'll see that this is in SVG,
making it a vector image.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.020
Sam's cute kittens are a photo, which
means that is by default a raster image.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.230
That is to say,
it's a grid of colored dots.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.410
The Mexican flag is pretty complex,
but believe it or not,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.770
this is an SVG,
making it a vector graphic.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.115
This middle part here is
obviously the tough part.

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:38.160
And while it does look complex,
you can make it with an SVG.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.520
If you don't believe me, check out
in DevTools this file's source.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.980
And for this last gradient, it can
be defined as some geometric rules

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.190
governing how the color should change,
so this one is also a vector image.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.160
So the final tally is that
the Chrome logo is a vector,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.570
the kitten is a raster.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.920
And then the Mexican flag,
repeat background,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.330
and gradient backgrounds
are all vector images.
