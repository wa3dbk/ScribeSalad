00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.006
Now, that we've solved this equation one way. Let's try and solve it using

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.077
logs. Now, using a log as an operator is a little bit different from the way

00:00:08.077 --> 00:00:12.572
other operators work. We still have to do the same thing to both sides of the

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:17.004
equation, but we're not multiplying by log. What we're doing is we're using

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:21.420
each side of the equation as the input to the log function. And because it is a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.500
function, when the inputs are the same, their outputs will be the same as well.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.465
Now, since on the left side here, we have the function 10 to the x and we want

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:37.210
to get x by itself. We want to find the inverse of f of x equals 10 to the x.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.920
So what base log do you think we'll need to use?
