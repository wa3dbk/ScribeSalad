00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.720
The lowest common denominator for these three fractions would be p minus 1 times

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.156
p minus 2 times p plus 3, fantastic work for finding that one. First we factor

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:16.239
this denominator to p minus 2 times p minus 1, we find factors of 2 that sum to

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.455
negative 3. For our second denominator, we find factors of negative 6 that sum

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:25.921
to positive 2, which are positive 3 and negative 2. Once our denominators have

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:30.660
been factored, we're ready to use our factor tree. So we have p minus 1 times p

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.273
minus 2 times p plus 3. This is our lowest common denominator.
