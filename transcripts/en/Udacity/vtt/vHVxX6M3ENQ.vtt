00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Evans] The key point is that this was for weak collision resistance.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For weak collision resistance, our assumption,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
an attacker needs to do about 2 to the b work where b is the number of hash bits

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to have a good chance of finding a collision.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Strong collision resistance is harder than weak.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To obtain strong collision resistance is actually much harder,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we'll see that we need about twice as many bits for that--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that the attacker's effort is more like 2 to the b over 2,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so we'll need about twice as many output bits in our hash function to provide this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The reason for this is because of what's known as the birthday paradox.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's called a paradox. It's not really a paradox.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's a surprise to people who don't follow the mathematics on this,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but there's nothing paradoxical about it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's not like the Berry paradox that leads to a contradiction.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The way this is usually framed is you have some group of k people--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
let's say it's a kindergarten classroom--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and you want to know what the probability that 2 people have the same birthday.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The reason this is called a paradox is the answer is actually much higher

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
than most people expect. So let's compute this.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We'll assume that there are no leap years and that birthdays are uniformly distributed.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We assume the same property for our outputs of our ideal hash function.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So we'll compute the complement probability that there are no duplicates,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and then the probability that there is at least 1 duplicate is 1 minus this.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And the way to think about that is we can go through the people in the class.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We can assign some birthday to each one.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So we'll assign b0 to the first one, b1 to the second one,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
keep assigning birthdays.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
There are lots of different ways we could do that.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In order to assign birthdays with no duplicates,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
then there's a limited number of ways that we can pick any of 365 days

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
for the first birthday.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
For the second one, if we want no duplicates,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we can't use whatever day we pick for the first one.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So it will be that times 364 times 363 and so forth,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and that's the number of ways to assign birthdays with no duplication.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We're trying to compute the probability, so we're going to divide that

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
by the number of ways to assign with duplication,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which is just 365 choices for each person.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So in general, this first value is n factorial divided by n minus k factorial,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and the bottom result is just n to the k.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
N is the number of possible days or the number of possible hash outputs.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
K is the number of trials.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And so our probability that there are duplicates is just 1 minus this.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This is what we need for strong collision resistance.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's higher than what we needed for weak collision resistance,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
which was 1 minus 1 minus 1 over n to the k.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So to actually compute this, these numbers would get really big

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
if we tried to actually compute the factorials.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Instead we need to use approximations to do this.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But to give you some idea what the results are like,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
if we have the duplicate birthday question where we have 365 days and 20 people,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the probability that there's at least 1 duplicate exceeds 0.4.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
If we're thinking about hash collisions, if we only had a 64-bit hash

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and our attacker was much weaker than the one we hypothesized--

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
let's say they can only do 2 to the 32--that's already almost a 40% chance of success.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
This success goes up quite quickly.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
If the attacker can do 2 to the 34 hashes, then the success probability is very close to 1.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So the conclusion is that given an ideal hash function

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
with N possible outputs, an attacker needs about N guesses to find an input

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that hashes to a particular value but only needs about the square root of N guesses

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to find a pair that collide.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This assumes the attacker can store all those hash values as they try the guesses

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and compare it to all the previous ones.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
This is the reason why hash functions need to have large outputs.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
SHA-1, which was a widely used hash function, used 160 bits in its output.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This was actually broken.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
There is a way to find collisions using SHA-1 with only 2 to the 51 operations--

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
much fewer than the 2 to the 80 that one would expect from this square root estimate,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and that's because of mathematical weaknesses in the way SHA-1 works.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
SHA-2, the output can be either 256 or 512 bits.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
As long as there aren't mathematical weaknesses in the cipher,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
if it was a really ideal hash function, this would be big enough to defeat any realistic attacker,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but there are beginning to be suggestions that there may be ways to break this.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
No practical breaks have been found yet.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And SHA-3, the winner is expected to be announced later this year.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So for the rest of this class we're going to assume that we do have an ideal hash function

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and that it has enough outputs to provide strong collision resistance

00:05:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
against a motivated attacker.
