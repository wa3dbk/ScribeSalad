00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.880
When building an app that uses
location services like this,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.240
there are a number of events that
happen in the app lifecycle,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.140
in addition to the usual
activity lifecycle events.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.580
Let's take a look at the entire
set of events, one by one, and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.160
specify what we need to do in each.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.970
First of course, is the OnCreate method.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.860
We've implemented this already.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.170
This is called when our
activity is created.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.095
In this we set up the GoogleApiClient.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.200
And we tell it to use
location services and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.890
the location of the call backs to call
when stuff happens on the client.

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:41.410
Once OnCreate has done its thing
the app will start running.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.810
And because we're using asynchronous
callbacks on the GoogleApiClient

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.610
more functions are going to fire
while the client is running.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.650
So immediately after OnCreate Android
calls the OnStart activity.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.360
And in this we will tell
the GoogleApiClient

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.260
again to start connecting
to location services.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.580
Depending on the relationship
between the client and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.030
the location services,
one of three things will happen.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.270
If it connects successfully
the OnConnected callback will fire.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.720
We'll look at this in a moment.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.090
If it fails,
the OnConnectionFailed will fire.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.260
If it was previously connected, but

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.120
something has gone wrong with
the connection causing it to suspend,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.220
then the OnConnectionSuspended
will fire.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.980
You need to implement all three of these
functions or your app won't compile.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.960
So be sure at the very least to put a
logging line in the ones that you don't

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.250
want to write detailed code for yet,
for example the OnConnectionFailed and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.190
the OnConnectionSuspended.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.310
Now let's look at OnConnected.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.805
In this method, we'll create
a new LocationRequest object.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.440
We'll set its priority,
we'll set its interval, and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.170
then we'll start requesting
updates from Location Services.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.980
We'll see what that code
looks like in a moment.

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:13.360
Now when the Location Services see
a new location for the device,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.900
they will then give a callback
to OnLocationChanged, and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.970
this will give you a location object.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.940
This object, you can parse with
details about the location,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.450
such as the latitude and longitude.
