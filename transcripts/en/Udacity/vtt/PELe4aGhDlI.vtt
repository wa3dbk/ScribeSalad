00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.007
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And the answer is line D. Note that the scale on the x-axis is that two days

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:10.460
pass for every square we move over. Now on the y-axis, every grid line indicates

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.968
another $1000 in profit. We can see that on our orange line, if we move over two

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:21.285
days, we have to move up a $1000, and 1000 over 2 is 500. We also can see that

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:26.541
the y intercept is at 0, negative 2000, which is what we're looking for.
