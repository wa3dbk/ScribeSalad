00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.399
In the last two lessons of our course, we're going to discuss two topics that

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.540
many people that are the sum of psychology. That's mental disorders and their

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.062
treatments. However, as we talked about in last 14 lessons that this isn't all

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:17.910
psychology has to offer. And as we've said before, many psychologists have

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.910
different opinions on different things And mental disorders and their

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.712
treatments are two of those things. In fact, many government agencies question

00:00:25.712 --> 00:00:31.020
the way we diagnose mental disorders, but we'll get into that in a little bit.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.481
For now, let's go to Susan for an important note on the upcoming lessons. As

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:38.193
we've discussed with many of the topics such as consciousness, arousal, and

00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:42.360
stress. We can use the idea of a continuum to look at what is considered

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.558
normal, and what is considered not normal. And that's what makes diagnosing

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:51.654
mental disorders so problematic and challenging. In that we have to determine

00:00:51.654 --> 00:00:56.416
what is too far on the continuum to be considered normal. Now here when we say

00:00:56.416 --> 00:01:00.056
normal, we're talking about this in a statistical sense and not necessarily a

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:05.408
value judgement. Now psychologist who study mental disorders do so to

00:01:05.408 --> 00:01:10.395
understand, treat and prevent human misery. When behavior falls outside of the

00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:15.018
normal range on that continuum. Many people find this area of psychology very

00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:19.219
interesting. And although the way society has treated people with mental

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.770
illness has evolved greatly, there are still cross cultural differences in the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.150
way people, view and treat individuals with mental illness.
