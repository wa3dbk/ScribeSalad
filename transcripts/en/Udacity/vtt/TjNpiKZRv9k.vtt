00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.520
Now we can calculate the sum of squares for between group variability.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.300
Remember, it's the squared deviation of each group mean from the grand mean.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.036
Then we sum all these deviations up, and multiply by n, the sample size in each

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:16.740
group.
