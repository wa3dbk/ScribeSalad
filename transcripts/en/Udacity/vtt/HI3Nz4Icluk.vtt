00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.876
So tell us how you got involved in GPU's with the first place.

00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:06.200
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It goes way back; I was actually an undergrad.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.329
I was working on some of the original SGI Octanes with OpenGL

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:16.950
and discovering that actually some of those OpenGL Octane machines for doing graphics--

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.036
you know, the kinds of image processing you do in OpenGL

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:24.212
could actually be used for simple computational things like fluid flow.

00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:28.709
So 1 of my undergraduate theses was to study fluid flow and simulation

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:31.784
in the OpenGL pipeline on an old SGI Octane,

00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:35.129
and then went on to Stanford, did a few other things but came back to it eventually

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.334
and that built a career out of it.
