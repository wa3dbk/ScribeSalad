We know this value inside needs to be greater than 7 or this value inside can be

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:08.947
less than negative 7. Remember to catch that inequality sign, we have to reverse

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.402
it for the negative answer. We can subtract 1 from both sides and then divide by

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:17.658
2. So x is greater than 3. That's one part of our solution. For the other

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.659
inequality, I subtract 1 from both sides, then divide by 2, so x is less than

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:27.831
negative 4. On a number line, we have x greater than 3, and x less than negative

00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:33.099
4. Remember, any number in either region, this region or this region, will work

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:38.003
for my inequality. If x is any value in here or any value in here the condition

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:42.395
is satisfied. In the interval notation we'd have negative infinity comma

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:46.994
negative 4. We use parenthesis because we can include these values. Then the

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:51.370
union because you want this or this region other than 3 to positive infinity

00:00:51.382 --> 00:00:55.325
again with parenthesis. If you got that one right, excellent work.
