00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.705
Here were the two original inequalities and these were the solutions, x less

00:00:04.717 --> 00:00:09.309
than negative 3 or x less than or equal to negative 4. Let's compare the two

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:13.813
number lines. It's harder to see the number lines compared horizontally, so

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:18.325
let's stack them on top of each other. When looking at the number lines, we

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:23.211
values of x that satisfy this inequality or this inequality. So, we want all of

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:27.405
these values. Any value within this region or any value within this region

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:31.785
satisfies one of the conditions. Notice that the top number line is contained

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:36.190
entirely within the second one. That means, we only need the solutions that are

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:40.992
less than negative 3. Any value that's less than negative 3 will work in this

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:45.037
first inequality and any value less than negative 4 will work in this

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:50.954
inequality. That's why we want this region. We want these values or these

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:55.967
values, so we show all these values on one number line. This is our solution

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.955
set. Any value of x for negative infinity up to negative 3 but not including

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:06.109
negative 3 will work. x needs to be less than negative 3. In interval notation,

00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:10.757
we list it like this. This is a really tough problem. So, if you got the one

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:11.877
right, great work.
