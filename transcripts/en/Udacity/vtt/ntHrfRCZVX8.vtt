00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
To get a feel for software architecture, we will do an exercise first described

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.120
in a paper by David Parnas, which is linked on the class resources page.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.940
The exercise asks you to come up with four different architectures that

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.500
address the same problem.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.090
The problem is to design a program that produces a Key Word in Context index,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.510
also called a KWIC index.
