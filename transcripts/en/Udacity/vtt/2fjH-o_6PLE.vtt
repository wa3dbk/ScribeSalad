00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.769
We can use the power property

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:07.599
to transform the first term we have here, 
3 ln of (x+4)

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.851
to become ln of (x+4) cubed.

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:16.018
Note that the cube here applies to the entire input 
of the log.

00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:19.184
It goes round the whole expression (x+4).
