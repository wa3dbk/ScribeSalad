Here's the spreadsheet with the karma points per post. If we go to the bottom,

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:16.372
write equals average a 1 colon a 200. You should have gotten that your average

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:22.335
is about 12.96. If it rounded up to the nearest integer value then that's fine.
