00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.130
There is a second notion of vector
multiplication that is common especially

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.430
in the context of engineering,
physics, and computer graphics.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.690
This product is the cross product.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.530
The cross product is very useful in
three dimensional linear algebra but

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.748
it does not have a generalization
to higher dimensions.

00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:22.362
Geometrically, the cross product
of two vectors, v and w,

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:25.811
is a vector that is
orthogonal to both v and w.

00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:30.514
And has magnitude of v times
magnitude of w times sine of

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:35.150
theta where theta is
the angle between v and w.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.230
Note that unlike the dot product the
output of a cross product is a vector,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.430
not a number.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.088
Let's look at this definition
a bit more closely.

00:00:44.088 --> 00:00:47.310
Notice that if theta is 0 or
pi that is 0 or

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.540
180 degrees, then the cross
product will have magnitude 0.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.540
So in other words, the cross product of
two parallel vectors is the 0 vector.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.980
Also if either v or

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.420
w is the 0 vector, then the cross
product will be the 0 vector as well.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.130
Assuming we're not in one of these
degenerate cases, notice that there

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.330
were, in fact, two vectors that meet
the geometric description given so far.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.050
These vectors are negatives
of each other.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.880
In order to determine which vector to
use, we proceed by the right-hand rule.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.160
Here's how the right-hand rule works.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.280
If the cross product is v cross w,
imagine your right thumb pointing

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.710
in the direction of v and your right
index finger in the direction of w.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.280
Then extend your right middle finger,
and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.830
then the direction it points will
be the direction of the cross w.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.670
So, in this case,
it will be pointing up.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.130
Notice that if we switch the order
of the cross product to w cross v,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.850
then using the right-hand rule will
give us the downward pointing vector.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.240
This gives us the equation v cross
w equals the negative of w cross v

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.250
because switching the order of
multiplication negates the product.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.780
We call the cross-product
anticommutative

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.370
as opposed to
the commutative dot product

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.479
in which switching the order
does not affect the product.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.300
A consequence of this geometric formula

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.540
can be seen in the parallelogram
spanned by v and w.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.520
Take the length of the v arrow to
be the base of the parallelogram.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.430
Then the height of the parallelogram
is the length of this segment

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.920
from the head of the w arrow to the line
spanned by v perpendicular to v.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.750
Using the trigonometric identity, sine
of theta equals opposite over hypotenuse

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.850
which is the SOH from SOH-cah-toa.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.490
We have that sine of theta equals
the height divided by the length of w.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.356
In other words,

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:53.180
the length of w times sine of theta
equals the height of the parallelogram.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.810
Remembering that the area of
a parallelogram is base times height,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.610
this means that the area of this
parallelogram is the magnitude of v

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.710
times the magnitude of
w times sine of theta.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.930
In other words,
it's the length of v cross w.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.250
Another geometric note is that the area
of this triangle spanned by v and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.210
w is exactly one half of the area
of the full parallelogram.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.030
That means the area of the triangle
will be one-half times

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.260
the magnitude of the cross product.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.900
Again, all this is great, but

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.180
it's of little use to us without a
practical formula for the cross product.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.250
So given vectors v with coordinates x1,
y1,z1,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.800
and w with coordinates x2, y2,
z2, here's such a formula.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.153
The cross product of v and
w is the vector.

00:03:43.153 --> 00:03:49.573
First coordinate, y1z2- y2z1.

00:03:49.573 --> 00:03:57.513
Second coordinate, it's the negative
of the quantity (x1z2- x2z1).

00:03:57.513 --> 00:04:03.053
And the third coordinate is x1y2- x2y1.

00:04:03.053 --> 00:04:08.678
So for an example, if we wanted to
find the cross product of the vectors,

00:04:08.678 --> 00:04:15.059
v, which is 5, 3- 2, and w, which is- 1,
0, 3, then we would compute.

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:19.500
First coordinate, 3 x 3- 0 x -2.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.440
Second coordinate, negative,
quantity of, 5 x 3- (-1) times (-2).

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.967
Third coordinate, 5 x 0- (-1) x 3.

00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:35.770
And that would give us the vector 9,
-13, 3.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.519
One way to help confirm that we did our
arithmetic correctly is by checking

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:44.437
that our outcome is orthogonal
to both of our vectors v and w.

00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:49.462
The dot product of v with
the cross product will be

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:54.609
45- 39 + 6 = 0, and
then the dot product of

00:04:54.609 --> 00:05:00.021
w with the cross product
will be -9 + 0 + 9 = 0.

00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:03.990
So our result is orthogonal
to both v and w.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.510
We can also use our cross product to
find the area of the parallelogram

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.590
spanned by v and w.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.410
To do this we would take
the magnitude of our cross product,

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.440
which would be the square root of 9
squared + -13 squared + 3 squared.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.354
Computing this gives us
approximately 16.093.
