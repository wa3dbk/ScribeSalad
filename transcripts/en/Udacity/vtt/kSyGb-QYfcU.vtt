00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.460
our results. A good sample size, a representative

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.730
sample and a sound methodology are all really

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.630
important in a good research study. When you

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.870
read and analyze research, you should always be

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.010
aware of these factors. That way, you can

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.010
make good decisions based off of valid research.
