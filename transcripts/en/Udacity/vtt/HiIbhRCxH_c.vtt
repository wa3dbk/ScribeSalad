00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.437
Since we already found it's asymptotes, I've gone ahead and given you the graph

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:10.092
of this function. f of x equals 2x minus 3 over x minus 5. We still have,

00:00:10.092 --> 00:00:14.118
haven't shown how the solution set of the inequality related to this relates to

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:19.482
our function. Remember that the inequality we were working with was 2x minus 3

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:24.646
over x minus 5 is greater than 0. What line do you think we need to add to our

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:28.156
graph to help us figure out how the solution of this inequality relates to this

00:00:28.156 --> 00:00:34.415
function over here? Shall we draw the line x equals 0, y equals 0, x equals 5,

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:36.773
or y equals 2?
