00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.380
So if you actually wanted to,
build this,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.130
you have to implement an algorithm for
doing it.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.800
Now, I tell you, I took this algorithm
from, I think, their claim slides,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.880
they're on the web, that he took
from somewhere else, etcetera.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.660
So I don't know for

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.315
sure that this algorithm is the one
they used, but it sounds pretty good.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.085
All right, it is,
it's similar to what you would do.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:20.295
So, first thing you do is you
project out these dots, and

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:21.275
you just detect them.

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:24.785
So you detect these speckles, and
you label all of them as unknown.

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:25.665
I don't know their depth.

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:29.945
Now what you start doing is you
randomly select a dot that's,

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:31.190
that's labelled as unknown.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.810
And then you take this windowed search,
all right,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.100
doing a normalized correlation,
and along a scanline.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.900
That is, that really should
say along an epipolar line.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.430
I know exactly where to look, okay,
and I check for the best match.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.440
And by the way, I have to make sure
that that best match is good enough.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.020
If that best match is not so good,
I mark that dot as invalid and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.210
I start looking for new dots again.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.280
But, if my first match is really good,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.150
I start doing what's
called region growing.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.310
I start looking around the,
that neighborhood for

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.280
matching other points against
the known pattern, okay?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.380
Oh yeah, by the way,
what am I correlating?

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.120
I know the pattern I'm projecting, so

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.130
I've got my little local pattern of
what's called pseudo random speckle

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.090
points, and
I just correlate them around.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.110
And so,
pixels nearby are added to a queue.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.280
For each pixel, I initialized its offset
looking for it from the one I just had.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.420
I search around a little bit,
see if I find a good enough match.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.440
If so, I label it as matched
with it's offset, its disparity.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.680
And then I look for its neighbors and
I add them to the queue.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.920
And I stop doing that
when that queue is empty,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.940
because I've finished
using this anchor point.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.580
And I go back again and I, I, I,
reinitial, I pick another point and I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.520
stop when all the points are labeled as
with a known depth or marked as invalid.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.280
So what makes that work is that I have
this, semi, this pseudo random pattern,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.430
so any little patch is not, can't be
matched everywhere but is matched or

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.230
just in one place well
along that epipolar line.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.810
I know those patterns and so I can
just drive that search very quickly.
