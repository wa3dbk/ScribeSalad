00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.791
Now, we're going to look at actual code.

00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:04.003
We're showing this in the class IDE.

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.178
We're going to walk through it very quickly and then run it in a shell window.

00:00:07.178 --> 00:00:09.945
And then we'll come back and look at specific bits of the code,

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:12.616
so you're sure you know what all of these calls do.

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:16.584
Then when we're done with that, we're going to ask you to make some changes and run it yourself.

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:19.063
So this is the actual class IDE.

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:20.825
I'm scrolling up and down.

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:23.103
Here is our main routine. That's what we're going to run.

00:00:23.103 --> 00:00:25.233
Let me briefly go through what we're looking at

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:29.175
and then I'll switch over to a shell window and show you how it actually runs.

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:30.979
We're going to start off by running code here

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.375
that's going to generate the input array on the host.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.905
Then we will declare the GPU memory pointers,

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:38.506
allocate the memory for those pointers,

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:41.777
copy our host array over to the device.

00:00:41.777 --> 00:00:43.321
Here's where the magic happens.

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:45.847
This is where we actually launch the kernel.

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:49.483
We then take the results here and copy them back to the CPU

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:53.965
and then we print out the resulting array, free the memory, and return 0.

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:56.024
And if we go way back up to the top here,

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:58.460
here's the actual kernel that we're going to run.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.102
Notice it's very simple.

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:02.836
Recall that we write a serial program here,

00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:07.233
and we know that all that program is going to do is square its input and return it into output.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.171
Now, let's actually run this code.

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:14.397
What we see here is me connected to a Cuda capable computer, actually in our lab at UC Davis.

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:19.082
We're going to first look at the code itself just so you know I'm compiling the real thing.

00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:24.917
Okay, here's our program.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:28.455
Now we're going to compile it, and here is the command to compile it.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.691
You don't have to worry about this in the class IDE,

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:35.260
but I'm just showing you what this looks like if you're running things on your own computer.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.666
What we see here is instead of running the regular C compiler we're running NVCC, the Nvidia C Compiler.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:47.140
The output is going to go an executable called square and our input file is square.cu.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.946
Dot cu is the convention for how we name Cuda files when we're saving them in a file system, okay?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.346
So, it completes pretty quickly.

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:56.660
Then I'm going to run the program square.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.659
What's square done?

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.090
It's taken our 64 element input array of the numbers 0 to 63,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.992
and it squared each one of those and printed out the output.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:11.363
We see 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on, all the way up to 63 squared.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:15.574
Now, again, you'll do this in the class IDE and some of the later examples that we do in this class

00:02:15.574 --> 00:02:17.471
will show how you do it in the class IDE.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:21.320
But just for now I'm showing you the results of this program done in a shell window.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.818
Let's go back to our code.
