Let's look at the car class. It's subclass is SUV. An SUV is a special kind of

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.816
a car. At superclass is vehicle. A car is a special kind of vehicle. A vehicle

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:16.428
is more general, a car is more specific. Subclasses of SUV, we don't have any.

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:22.886
Superclass of SUV, car is a superclass. And then going one further up, vehicle,

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:28.907
is also superclass, sometimes people say that car is a direct superclass. Now

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:32.043
we could implement, this vehicle hierarchy in Java, but truth be told, it's a

00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:36.049
little dull, and we'll come up with a more interesting hierarchy.
