If you're familiar with the flask
web development framework,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.110
you should be no stranger
to the app.route decorator.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.430
This decorator in flask can be used
to make URLs to render webpages and

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.540
API endpoints alike.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.140
You should also import
the jsonify package from

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.250
flask into your application.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.875
Jsonify can convert dictionaries
into JSON objects that can then be

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.050
sent to the client.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.700
The jsonify function in flask
returns the flask response object

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.430
that already has the appropriate content
type header for use with JSON responses.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.880
In this next exercise,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.350
you'll familiarize yourself with
making basic API endpoints with flask.
