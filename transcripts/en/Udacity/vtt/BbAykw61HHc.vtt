00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.910
Because access to the singleton is through a class, and

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.520
class names are normally known globally, singletons somehow,

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.660
sometimes act like global state instead of the traditional owned instances that

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.440
we see in other uses of, of classes in object-oriented languages.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.860
We can also run into trouble in situations where the clients are multithreaded.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.950
That is, several threads may be trying to create that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.670
single instance at one time.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.380
Leading to the production of multiple singletons.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.010
Question arises as to when you create the single instance.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.980
One strategy is to do it at startup.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.540
Which you could think of as eager construction.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.140
Or do you wait until the first use to, to create it,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.310
which could be called lazy construction.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.970
Then some issues with respect to what it actually means to be a singleton.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.310
Does singleton a word mean at most once or exactly once?

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.470
Similarly, does singleton mean only one ever or only one at a time?

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.989
In languages with destructors, like C++, you could get rid of the instance and

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.900
then later create another instance of that same singleton

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.770
without violating the rule that there's at most one such instance.
