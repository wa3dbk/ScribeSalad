00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.950
Alright. So it's worth asking, how do we find

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.980
this best line? So again there's an infinite number

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.710
of lines. How do we find one that fits

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.460
these points the best. And again we're defining best fit.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.730
As the one that has the least squared error, where the error is

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.970
going to be some of the distances between these x points and the green line

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.210
that we, that we fit. I'm not even sure that this really is the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.210
best fit in this case. I just kind of hand drew it. So, okay. So

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.680
is this something that we, that we would want to solve by hill climbing which

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.490
is to say, we kind of pick the. The slope and the intercept of

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.880
the line, and we just kind of try different values of this until it

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.700
gets better and better and then we can't get any better, and we stop.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.120
Can we do this using calculus? Can we use random search, where we just

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.580
like, pick a random M, pick a random B, and see if we're happy

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.210
with it? Or is this the sort of thing where we probably would just

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.730
go and ask a physicist because it

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.950
involves, like, continuous quantities, and we're discrete people?
