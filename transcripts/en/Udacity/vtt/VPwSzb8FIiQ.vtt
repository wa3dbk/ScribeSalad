00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, I'd like to ask you about the relationship between bar charts and scatter plots.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Both of these were used to plot two different sets of data against each other.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For example, home prices and home sizes. So a bar chart might look like this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For this bar chart, I'd like you to tell me which of these scatter plots looks most similar

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as if it could represent the same underlying data.

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is it this one, this one, this one, or this one? Please check whichever one looks closest.
