00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, quiz: What server does www.example.com use?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You're going to use the server header,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is in the responses, and I would like you to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of course use urllib2 and Python to answer this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You don't have to, but it will make

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.707
the rest of this lecture a lot easier if you start figuring out how to use it now.
