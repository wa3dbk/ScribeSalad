00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.478
We know for our ratio the number of dimes to quarters is 2 to 3 or 2 3rd. 2 is

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.527
the number of dimes, so I need the number of dimes is in the numerator on the

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.517
other side. I need to make sure the units match. I don't know the number of

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.566
dimes, so I'm going to call that d. And 231 would go in the denominator, for the

00:00:16.578 --> 00:00:20.894
number of quarters. Again, notice that the quarters are both in the denominator.

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:25.942
There's other ways to set up this proportion. Just be sure you're consistent

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:30.687
with your units. Now, we can solve this proportion using cross multiplication.

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:35.278
I'm going to multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators. The 3s

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.901
will reduce to 1, and the 231s will also reduce to 1. This leaves me with 231

00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:45.301
times 2, which is 462 and 3 times d, or 3d. Finally, we divide by 3 and we get

00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:50.922
154. Really great work if you got that one right. And even if you got it right

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:56.078
or wrong, try solving this a different way. See if you can set up other

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.718
proportions and get the same answer.
