00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.710
The construction of these truth tables, allows us to illustrate certain

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.150
important properties of logical predicates. To see those properties,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.040
let us do an exercise together. So here we have the predicate A, and

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.060
the predicate B. And here we have A and B, and B and A. Please fill these boxes,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.090
the truth values of A and B, the truth values of B and A.
