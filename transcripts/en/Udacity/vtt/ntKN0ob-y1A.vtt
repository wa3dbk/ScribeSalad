00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.920
Well that sounds great, but

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.010
how will be go about building
this interactive prototype?

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.010
We'll need a tool to build it.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.100
What we're looking for
has three key aspects.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.180
First there's interactivity.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.010
We only want tools that allow us
to build a clickable prototype.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.770
All the better if that prototype can be
interacted with on the target device.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.460
This is the fundamental part of
medium fidelity prototyping so

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.290
it's non-negotiable.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.470
We also want something that is fast.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.890
We are busy entrepreneurs, and we don't
have time to waste on learning a complex

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.180
tool for this task or on building
a prototype in a time consuming way.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.310
This is fundamental to all prototyping,
remember.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.570
We always want the fastest version
that will meet our requirements and

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.680
get us the info we need.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.545
Finally, we'll want to be able to
get that info from the right people.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.990
Sometimes, the right people for
the job are far away,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.860
which means that we'll want a tool
that makes it just as easy to get

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.020
feedback from someone halfway across the
globe as someone halfway down the block.
