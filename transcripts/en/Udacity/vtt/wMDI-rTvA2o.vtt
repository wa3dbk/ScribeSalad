00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.400
This first statement gives a definite time, which is like a point on a timeline.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.515
So, point is the correct answer. The second describes a distance, which is like

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:13.735
a vector. No specific point at sea level is given, so this does not describe a

00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:18.865
location. So, this statement describes a vector. This third sentence describes a

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:23.577
duration and no specific time, so it's like a vector. Finally, the fourth

00:00:23.577 --> 00:00:30.507
describes the location, given another location, and a motion vector, so it's a

00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:32.063
specific point.
