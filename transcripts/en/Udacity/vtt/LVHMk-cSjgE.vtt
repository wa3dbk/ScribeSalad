00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.780
let's take a look at the solution to this its a little bit tricky. Firstly, at

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.455
the top of our file we declare two new variables, frameRate and frame. Now,

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:11.796
frameRate represents how often we'd like to actually call the animate function.

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:15.799
Frame is a variable that we're going to use to represent what the current frame

00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.476
in our flip book is. Since we already have our frames array available, the next

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:23.767
step is to actually loop through our predefined assets, and load each of the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.726
defined images into the frames array. This follows the same 3 step process we

00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:31.815
saw before: create a new image, set its on load result, and then set its source.

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:35.115
Once this is done we can actually call this setInterval function, which will

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:38.300
call the animate function at the frameRate that we provided before. Now the

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:41.560
animate function has a little bit of tricky logic inside of it. First off, we

00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:45.432
have our frame counter that we've defined. We use this to define what image out

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:49.106
of the frames array we have to draw to the canvas, and of course, at our lovely

00:00:49.118 --> 00:00:52.834
position of 192 by 192. Once we've drawn the current frame we actually have to

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:55.785
increment it, and that's where this little nice piece of math comes along. What

00:00:55.785 --> 00:01:00.317
we do is increment the frame counter and then modulo it by the frame's length.

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:04.313
What will occur here is that if frame ever becomes longer than frame length, the

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:08.465
modulo function will have it loop around back to 0 without us having to have all

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:11.556
the other if statements involved. This is a nice little piece of math that you

00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:14.499
should put in your code. Your employer will be impressed by it. Now if you

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.248
followed all the code, you should see something like this running around on the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.843
screen. If you'll notice, something of this doesn't exactly look right. You

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:24.665
actually get each of the frames drawn over each other, creating this sort of

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:28.116
halo effect. There's a reason for this. It's worth noting that the canvas

00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:32.390
doesn't actually clear itself each frame. Instead it allows you to just keep

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:35.954
piling pixels on it as you go. In order to get rid of that ghosting effect, you

00:01:35.954 --> 00:01:40.016
have to put this line that we've conveniently left out of our previous function

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:44.641
back in, and that is context.clearRect. What this will do is actually clear all

00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:48.507
of the pixels to some default value allowing us to draw back on top of it. So

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:52.690
you won't get the previous images actually drawn on top of each other. The

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:56.990
result is a nice, nifty walking robot running around on your screen, just like

00:01:57.002 --> 00:02:01.172
it should. The result with clearRect is this nice, fancy walking robot.
