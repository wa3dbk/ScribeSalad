00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.124
C has 1 entry per edge, so it is E long.

00:00:04.124 --> 00:00:08.485
R, on the other hand, has 1 entry per vertex, so it's V long.

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:11.833
Although we're going to put 1 additional element at the end, and we'll see why in a minute.

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:14.580
Either V or V+1 is accurate.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.686
We're also going to store a depth array, D initialized to -1, that indicates the depth for each node in the graph.
