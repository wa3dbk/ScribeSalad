00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.250
Alright, we're going to look at another algorithm that kind

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.170
of takes the idea of random restarts one step further.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.240
Instead of just waiting until you hit a local optimum

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.380
to, to decide that you're going to randomly restart, there's always

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.460
a chance of taking a step in a downward direction

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.690
while you're trying to do your hill climbing. And the

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.310
algorithm that we're talking about in concretely is called Simulating

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.130
Annealing. So the basic idea is that we don't always improve.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.570
Sometimes we actually need to search. We need to take the point

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.550
where we are now and wander away from it, with the hope

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.340
of finding something even better. And you can think of this as

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.790
being related to the notion exploring and exploiting. The hill climbing is what

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.790
it's doing is always trying to exploit. It's always trying to climb

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.810
its way up the hill as quickly as it can, which can

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.240
lead it to getting stuck. Exploring is the idea of visiting more

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.090
of the space with the hope that you can actually climb even further.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.450
&gt;&gt; So,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.790
which is better then, exploring or exploiting?

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.480
&gt;&gt; Well you have to trade these off really carefully. So, if you're just

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.540
exploring, it means you're just randomly wandering

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.890
around the space. You're not using any of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.300
the local information to improve yourself. But if you only exploit then you can

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.450
get stuck in these local optima. So you need to do a bit of both.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.940
&gt;&gt; So, since I'm always trying to connect

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.490
this back to stuff we talked before. If you

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.280
exploit all the time that's kind of like

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.810
overfitting. That's like believing your data too much and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.070
not taking any chances at all. Does that make

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.810
sense or is that too much of a stretch?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.650
&gt;&gt; I doesn't make sense to be me but I'm sure it make sense to you.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.120
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It makes sense to me.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.080
&gt;&gt; So you want to think of that as being kind of like overfitting.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.210
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, the fundamental problem of overfitting, right,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.880
is believing your data too much. And, and dealing with just

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.420
the coincidences of what you happen to see. And that's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.950
like being very myopic. And exploiting, in this case, only taking

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.920
the direction which you go is like believing the data point

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.530
where you happen to be. I predict, from this one example, that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.870
I should be headed in this direction, and I don't care about

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.790
anything else. And I'm not going to worry about anything else. Well,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.220
that's kind of like believing too much, which is sort of

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.560
what overfitting is. Meanwhile search on the other hand, the exploring, is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.570
like believing nothing and taking advantage of nothing. So obviously as you

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.038
need to take, as you said, take advantage of the local information.

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:09.970
You need to believe it at least a little bit at least

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.080
some of time time or otherwise it's as if you've learned nothing.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.540
&gt;&gt; Alright, well I definitely agree with

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.050
you that there's a trade-off there and that

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.078
there's a resemblance to overfitting. I don't,

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:20.290
I don't know how deep that resemblance is.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.820
&gt;&gt; Superficial. They're like twin cousins.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.970
&gt;&gt; Twin cousins from another family branch. So the simulated annealing

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.620
algorithm that we're talking about is

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.020
related to an algorithm called Metropolis-Hastings,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.684
which I always thought sounded really cool. And the whole

00:02:37.684 --> 00:02:42.170
idea of it actually gets into metallurgy. So here I drew

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.270
a picture of a sword. And we want the sword,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.120
when we're making a sword if we're a blacksmith and we're

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.610
making a sword, we want it to be nice and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.540
hard. And the way to make it hard and sharp, and,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.030
and, and well structured, is for all the molecules to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.020
be, be aligned in the same way. So they fit together

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.700
very snugly and they kind of lock in. And, so, there is

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.120
a bit of an optimization process that has to happen. There is

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.170
all these different ways that the molecules can be arranged and we

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.340
would like to settle into an arrangement that has the lowest energy. Well,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.950
it turns out that the way blacksmiths have figured out to do

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.680
this is they will make the sword and then do repeated hea,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.690
heating and cooling, and that actually show, they can see that that

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.420
actually strengthens the blade, and, and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.030
what's really happening at the molecular level

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.290
is it's giving the molecules an opportunity to

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.090
realign themselves, to find an even better solution to

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.580
the problem of how they can all fit into

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.170
that space. So, this annealing is, is this idea

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.390
of heating and cooling. And we're not really

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.170
literally heating and cooling, though of course when we

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.550
run the computer it is getting a bit hotter.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.020
We're just simulating the idea of the temperature changing.
