00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:02.976
well we know x is janet's speed.

00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:06.886
when we first started solving problem we wanted to find janet's speed.

00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:09.884
so we let janet's speed or her rate equal x.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:13.888
we didn't know it.from there we were able to fill in the other pieces of information.

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:21.630
we knew janet's distance and rohan's distance and we also knew that rohan traveled 20 mph faster than janet.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.436
once we have these 4 pieces of information we were able to write expressions for each of the person's time.

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:34.676
we knew janet's time 250/x.and rohan's time 300/x+20.

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:42.190
and since they both spend the same amount of time traveling we can say janet's time equal to rohan's time.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.784
we took the equation we saw for x which is janet's speed.

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:51.789
100 mph.so if this was janet's speed then we know rohan's speed as well.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.982
he traveled 20 mph faster than janet.

00:00:56.648 --> 00:01:00.648
so we just add on 20 to janet's speed which equals 120 mph for rohan.
