00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.890
The home screen of a website or

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.080
the loading screen of your mobile app,
will be the first impression for users.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.047
And you want to make sure
that you get this right.

00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:11.653
Here's Udacity's homepage
as of April 2015.

00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:15.890
A clear goal headlines the page, and
there's plenty of white space around

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.905
the headlines, and
the tagline to draw users into them.

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:22.920
Homepages like this one should
answer these questions.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.040
What is this?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.340
What is being offered?

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.590
What can I do here?

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.150
And how do I start?

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.150
In Udacity's case, the how can I get
started comes just below the fold

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.890
with a description of
the Nanodegree program.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.380
You want all of this
information to be present, but

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.340
you should also be careful
not to overwhelm your users.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.330
You want users to have a clear
understanding of what you offer, and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.760
then you can link to other pages for

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.550
users to learn more about
your product or services.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060
Many companies put those
links in the footer.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.700
Going back up to the top of
the homepage, we can see that from here,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.230
I could sign up for an account, or
I could sign in if I'm an existing user.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.840
To learn more about how
nanodegrees work in particular

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.156
I could click on one of these.

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:05.300
Homepages are tricky in
that they need to do a lot.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.480
But you want to be careful about
adding more and more to that page so

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.490
sometimes you might have a landing page,
like this one.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.470
Landing pages are for specific products
that you want to show to your users.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.510
They allow you to focus on
one particular product.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.550
Notice that here,
there's a clear call to action.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.840
I can get a sense about what this
product is from the copy on the page and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.080
also from this background image.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.770
Scrolling down, I can even get
more details about the program.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.220
To learn more about
designing homepages and

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.220
landing pages, check out the articles
that are linked in the Instructor Notes.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.700
At the very least, you need to
strive for an informative page, and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.470
at the best,
your homepage should be memorable.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.610
It's important to keep in mind that
your homepage doesn't have to be static.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.610
It should be a work in progress.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.080
Here's another version
of the Udacity homepage.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.700
And notice that it's changed slightly.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.702
We have different copy and these
images have been condensed together.

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:02.080
Your homepage might also be dynamic in
that you might be AB testing certain

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.060
features of it to see what
drives users actions.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.820
You might also just be trying to refine
your value proposition for your users.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.788
And even before that homepage,

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:13.980
this is what Udacity's homepage
looked like once upon a time.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.870
As you can see,
it's not as informative or

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.740
clear at answering the questions,
what is this and what can I do here?

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.460
At the end of the day, you want to
make a fantastic first impression.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.250
It's really up to you
to delight users so

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.630
that way they come to know who you
are and what you have to offer.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.670
Now it's your turn to do a little
investigation of your own.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.660
I'd like you to find three homepages for
relatively new companies and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.022
analyze them.

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:40.418
You want to get a feel for
what type of information and

00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:42.570
elements live on their homepages.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.220
For each of the homepages you
should ask yourself: what

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.250
elements comprise the homepage, what are
the main calls to action, what does that

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.250
homepage say about the company,
its users and the value proposition?

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.740
And what are the most likely flows

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.520
from the homepage to
other places on the site?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.020
In other words,
what could you do from the homepage?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.410
Finally, what are some
of the similarities and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.160
differences you see across
the homepages you looked at?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.240
Write a post that answers
these questions and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.950
share it on the discussions.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.810
