00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Evans] Units like nanoseconds are fairly hard to understand,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
so what I want to do to give a better understanding

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of what the different types of memory in a computer are

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is turn those into different units and compare them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If we think about the light bulb switch,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which certainly would not be a reasonable way to store memory in a computer today,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the cost per bit is probably about 50 cents.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So we can buy light bulbs for about 50 cents.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's assume the sensing is free.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's already going to be ridiculously expensive.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll call it US dollars, 50 cents per bit for using a light bulb and a light sensor.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The latency is about 1 second.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And what we're going to do in the quiz is convert latencies in terms of time

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in terms of the equivalent for the distance light travels in that amount of time.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The other type of memory I mentioned--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we didn't see this because it's sort of hard to extract from the computer--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is the CPU register.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The registers are part of the processor, so it's hard to measure their actual cost.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's probably close to a 10th of a cent, though, if we look at the total cost of the processor

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and how that depends on the number of registers you have.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The amount of memory that you have in registers is close to a kilobyte or 2

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
in a typical processor.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Only a few thousand bytes in the registers.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The latency is the shortest of any of these.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's less than a nanosecond.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And the time to get memory from a register has to be short enough

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that you can do it within a single cycle.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So we saw our cycle speed for the processor was 2.7 gigahertz.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That means we need to do 2.7 billion cycles in a second.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The time of a cycle is less than 0.4 nanoseconds.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Within a given cycle, we at least need to be able to get memory out of a register.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So that's an approximation of the time there.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We'll measure the latency distance in terms of meters for light.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So the third type of memory we've talked about so far is the DRAM.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The cost per bit for the DRAM--well, our DRAM costs about $10

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and it stores 2 gigabytes.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So in order to write down the cost per bit, we really need a new unit.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
If we try to write it in terms of dollars and cents,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it's going to be far too hard to see.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So to fit DRAM into this, DRAM costs $10 US dollars for 2 gigabytes.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
If we want to write that in terms of a meaningful cost per bit,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we need a new kind of currency.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We're going to need far too many zeroes before we get to the value

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
using regular dollars and cents.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So we're going to use a new kind of currency.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
To measure the cost of DRAM in a meaningful way,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
we need a new kind of currency, which we'll call a nanodollar.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
A nanodollar is one-billionth of a dollar.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So if we have a billion nanodollars, that would make 1 dollar.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I don't have one of these on paper.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's money that's really not worth the paper that it's printed on,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
but it's a useful unit for measuring the cost per bit.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now we have a more useful currency for measuring the cost per bit of DRAM.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The cost of DRAM turns out to be, in terms of nanodollars, 0.58 nanodollars per bit.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And we saw that the latency for DRAM was 12 nanoseconds.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So now for the quiz I want you to figure out the latency distance

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
for each of these different types of memory.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Note that the units are different here.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We used dollars and nanodollars.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
For the distances we're going to use kilometers, meters, and meters.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You've got all the information you have here.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
As a reminder, the speed of light is about 300,000 kilometers per second.
