00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.490
let's go through the terms, 1 by 1, to
figure out what type each of them is. So

00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:09.110
first we have y, y is not just a number,
so that means it cant be a constant term.

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:13.850
And we also know, that y is a frequently
used letter, to represent variables in

00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:18.510
Algebra. So, y is a variable term. Then we
have 3 million. There are no symbols,

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:23.247
other than numbers in this term. And
we know that 3 million is a number, we

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.691
know how big it is already, so this has a
constant value, that means that its a

00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:32.564
constant term. And lastly we have negative
-100,000x. Note that the negative sign

00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:37.474
belongs with the term itself, so we dont
say that the term is 100,000x, we say that

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:42.925
it is -100,000x, anyway, this term has two
parts, it has a part with a number and a

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:48.137
part with a variable. As we talked about
before though if a term has a variable in

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.224
it at all, then that term counts as a
variable term. When we plug in numbers for

00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:58.355
x -100,000x is going to change values
because of what we plug in. So the whole

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:01.837
term despite have a number in it counts as
a variable term.
