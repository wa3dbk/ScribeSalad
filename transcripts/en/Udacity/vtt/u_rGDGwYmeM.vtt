00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.850
All right, so
now that we're back from our aside,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.330
let's go back to thinking about this
applications program interface.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.770
So I talked about planning and
I talked about learning.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.402
And it turns out that there's
two other sub-processes or

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:13.610
sub-components that might
be useful to think about

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.860
that kind of relate these
quantities together differently.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.860
One is the notion of a modeler.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.360
What a modeler can do
is take transitions and

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.100
build a modeler out of it.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.230
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.100
&gt;&gt; And a simulator is kind of the
inverse, where you can take a model and

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.680
you can use it to generate transitions.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.511
You can actually kind of imagine
running around in the world,

00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:30.878
Just by simulating that row.

00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:32.886
This is generally not
a very hard thing to do.

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:36.536
Though there's certainly applications
of reinforcement learning where this

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.230
simulator is extremely expensive.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.410
Because it's simulating a lot
of things in the world.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.370
And this modeling problem you
can think of again as a kind of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.310
machine learning problem.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.820
Right?
Trying to map this kind of information

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.440
into models.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.949
&gt;&gt; So you call them sub-processes.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.438
Does this mean that one way to do
learning would be to do modeling and

00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:57.692
simulating so that I had models.

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:59.541
And I knew what the reinforcement
function was, and

00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:01.000
then I could just do planning?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good idea.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.989
In fact, let's look at different ways
of gluing these things together.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.489
&gt;&gt; Okay.
