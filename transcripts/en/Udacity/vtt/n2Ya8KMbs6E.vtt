00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.260
Before we get started, let's take
a look at a concept that will be

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.450
very useful in our examples
of variable capture.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.430
Actually, the fancy name for
this is capture of lexical environment.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.570
Feel free to drop this in
any casual conversation if

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.170
you really want to look like a nerd.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.960
An alias is a simple way
of calling something or

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.780
someone that has a complex or
funny name.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.320
For example, say you're a huge,
professional wrestler and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.340
you want your name to scare
the crap out of your opponent.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.570
Do you seriously think
Terry Gene Bollea will do?

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.650
Of course not.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.080
That's why he goes by his type alias,
Hulk Hogan.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.592
Or you're just starting your
career as a pop singer, but

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:45.619
your parents bestowed upon you
the aristocratic sounding name of

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:48.268
Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong.

00:00:48.268 --> 00:00:50.159
It certainly sounds impressive, but

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.320
your fans will have a hard
time remembering it.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.270
Better go by the tape alias, Dido.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.700
In Swift, you can also give
new names to existing types.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.820
And this is extremely useful when
the original name is complex.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.004
Something like being able
to call Kurt Douglas.

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.300
Much better, don't you think so?

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.420
Let's see a few examples.
