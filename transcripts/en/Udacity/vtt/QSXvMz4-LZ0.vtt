The two lines of this graphs is never going to cross are y equals 0. The x axis

00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:11.010
over here and x equals 0. Now I didn't draw these two lines perfectly. But in

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.296
reality the graph of y equals 1 over x just gets super, super close to both of

00:00:14.296 --> 00:00:18.709
the axes. But it never, ever touches them. That's really cool.
