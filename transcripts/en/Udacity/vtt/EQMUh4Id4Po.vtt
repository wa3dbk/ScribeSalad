00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.030
All right, why don't we walk through the solution.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.920
Here, we're going to start with our olympic_medal_counts_df DataFrame,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.150
as we have in the previous exercises.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.160
First, we're going to create a new, smaller dataframe called metal counts,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.480
which is the olympic_medal_count_df DataFrame, but only the gold, silver, and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.125
bronze columns.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.175
Then we're going to use the numpy.dot function to matrix multiply this

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:26.810
metal_counts_matrix with the 4, 2, 1 array which represents the number of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.460
points that each country would score for a gold, silver, or bronze medal.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.280
So what we're going to get here is an array,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.190
where the value is 4 times the number of gold medals plus 2 times the number of

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.020
silver medals plus 1 times the number of bronze medals.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.750
Down here, I'm going to define this Python dictionary called olympic_points,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.430
where again I provide us the keys,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.490
the column names, and as the values panda series, where I provide as

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.370
the argument first the list of country names and here, this array points,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.040
which again has the total number of points that each country earned.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.830
Finally, I'm just going to say olympic_points_df is DataFrame of olympic_points.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.600
This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to pandas and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.610
numpy's functionality.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.950
