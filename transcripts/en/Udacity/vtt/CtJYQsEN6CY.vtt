00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.690
Having understood inodes and the basic characteristics of the

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.060
extended file system, let's now consider its merits and compare

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.190
it with FAT system. File creating means grabbing an inode

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.310
and updating the parent directory. This is not substantially different

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.570
from FAT. File growth, just means grabbing a new

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.220
data block and updating the inode, no big deal. We

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.830
are still efficient in terms of space. There's a little

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.230
waste in potentially unused fields in the inodes, and the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.370
indirection tables are space that would not be used if the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.210
file were stored in a FAT system, but this is usually

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.890
going to be small compared to the whole size of a file.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.390
As for access time, it is true that the inodes add

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.090
an extra layer of indirection as we go through the directory

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.700
tree. A directory points to the inode for a file, rather

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.350
than to the first state of the block. Because inodes are

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.560
cached in memory, however, this performance cost is minimal. Much more important

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.440
is that the inodes link the data blocks together in a treelike

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.740
structure, with a high branching factor, as many as an indirection table can

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.920
hold. This makes for much better random access than one gets from

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.880
the linked list chaining of the FAT format, at least for large files.
