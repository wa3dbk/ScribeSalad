00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.060
So, do all genes have this dominant and one recessive component?

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.182
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's a great question and the simple answer is no. Genetics is complicated. And

00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:13.915
we just covered a very basic example of dominance. Complete dominance over

00:00:13.915 --> 00:00:17.178
another allele. But there are examples where you have semi-dominance and

00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:21.354
co-dominance. And all kinds of other different factors are important in

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:26.701
determining this. But, there are many cases where this simple dominance does

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:27.910
hold true.
