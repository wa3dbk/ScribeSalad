We just said that for odd functions, f(-x) = -f(x).

00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:09.416
So I'm wondering if we can translate that to be a little bit more clear

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:13.771
in terms of coordinates of points on the graphs of odd functions.

00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:18.173
So if we know that a point (x,y) lies on the graph of an odd function,

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:23.423
then what does this rule tell us is another point that lies on the function?
