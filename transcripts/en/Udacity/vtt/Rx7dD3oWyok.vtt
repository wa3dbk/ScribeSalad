00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.010
So that's the end of the lesson. You learned how Hadoop

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.020
uses HDFS to store data and MapReduce to process it. In the

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.380
next lesson we'll walk through the code for a MapReduce program, and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.530
you'll be ready to write your own MapReduce programs to analyze data.
