00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.080
Key question between, going between analysis and design is how we are going to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.750
maintain these invariants. What maintains means is how,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.070
once the invariance is broken, you will propagate the knowledge of the break to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.030
the appropriate components so they can take steps to re-establish the invariant.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.080
We can call these invariant maintenance strategies, or we can just say.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.360
How are you going to implement this? And in particular,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.740
we're going to have examples of three invariant maintenance strategies.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.260
The first one is aggregated responsibility. That is, a single component is going

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.610
to be responsible for managing this process even if it has to invoke or

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.330
make use of several other components. That single component's responsible for

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.830
handling the external events after delegating the inherent maintenance to

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.290
the appropriate subordinate components. That's Strategy One.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.110
Strategy Two is the opposite distributed responsibility. Each component knows

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.040
about the dependent components and anything that it's responsible for managing.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.890
And invokes them when this state changes. And third invariant maintenance

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.970
strategy which is called the mediated responsibility or mediated strategy, okay?

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.090
It involves a special implementation element called a mediator, and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.240
it's provided, it's one mediator for each invariant. The mediator knows all.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay, it knows about the both the independent and dependent participants and

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.420
the invariant. The independent one is the one that gets informed when

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.010
the initial event takes place. And the dependent ones are the ones that have to

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.760
respond to it. Three strategies, aggregated in one place,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.010
distributed, or a new component, a mediator, responsible for dealing with it.
