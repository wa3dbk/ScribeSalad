Congrats on completing this course.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.260
Now it's your chance to
apply what you've learned to

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.370
create an interactive resume.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.009
If you enjoy learning JavaScript then
your next step after this project is

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.896
to enroll in the frontend
developer nanodegree program.

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:16.882
You'll learn the fundamentals of how the
web works, and gain a deeper knowledge

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:20.808
of the three foundational languages
that power each and every website, HTML,

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:21.990
CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.760
Your new journey awaits.
