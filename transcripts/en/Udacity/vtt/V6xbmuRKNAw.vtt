00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
And the correct here is that you should put this one here B, C, F and G.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.230
Now, I've chosen the sizes and values so that this is not that difficult for you to figure out

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.030
even though it is an NP complete problem in the general case.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.700
I suppose you have seen that there's lots of objects here, which have

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.820
a comparably small size and a very large value.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.960
So probably putting in F and G is rather obvious and also I would presume putting in B

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.790
and then once you're there, you can see what else you got and you've already used up

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.780
5 of your size units so you cannot put an E anymore.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.900
And then the best value of the remaining objects--A, C and D is given to you by C,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.090
which has a value of 5 as oppose to 4 and 2, and also you cannot put in more than one.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
So that makes C the only candidate to also put into that container,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.770
and for that, you get a total value of 3+5+5+2, so you get a value of 15 in your container.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.820
Actually, not using up all the space in the container because you only have

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.250
size 2, 4, 2, and 1, which is the total size of 9.

00:00:59.250 --> 99:59:59.000
So when a container of size 10, you can carry a value of 15 given these objects over here.
