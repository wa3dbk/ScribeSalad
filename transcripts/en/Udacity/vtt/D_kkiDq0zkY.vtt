00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.190
Here's the F table and we would need to use the degrees of freedom that you

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.080
found earlier. Since there were three groups, remember that there were two

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.710
degrees of freedom. And there were three cows per group who consumed the food.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.070
There were nine total values and the degrees of freedom for within group

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.583
variability was six. They intersect here at 5.1433. Our F statistic 27 is much

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:28.127
greater then our F-critical value. It's out here somewhere in the critical

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:32.878
region. Probably way out there. Therefore, we would accept the alternative. At

00:00:32.878 --> 00:00:36.654
least one pair of significant differences exists between the amount of food

00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:42.144
that cows ate. We summarize our results in our ANOVA table. This is how the

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:45.480
results are typically presented, even when we use software.
