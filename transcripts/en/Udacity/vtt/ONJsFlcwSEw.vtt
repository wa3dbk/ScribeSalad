And one more thing. On mobile, you can use a telecolon URL to create a

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.260
URL that when activated will actually dial

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.340
a telephone number. Of course, on desktop, these

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.900
URLs will typically fail, so you probably

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.410
want to deactivate them using a desktop media

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.750
query. This is a really handy feature, particularly

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.030
for business websites. Customes can instantly dial you.
