00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.730
A key piece of data,
medication compliance,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.100
has remained very difficult to
obtain in a cost effective manner,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.670
despite a great deal of research
in commercial activity.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.020
Devices and software
are available to remind patients,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.170
to monitor when they open
a special pill container, and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.700
to even dispense the proper
medications at the right time.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.040
There are continuing challenges with
usability, and with updating the more

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.920
advanced devices when medication
orders change, as they often do.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.280
The gold standard would be knowing
that patients actually consume their

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.270
medications at the proper time,
and in the proper dose.
