00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now we're going to do a quiz and what we're going do is try to calculate how much it cost

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to actually get an active customer and let's start with the pay-per-click.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's assume we're doing a web company and we spent 75 cents

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on Google AdWords for every click that comes to our website here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now assume we actually have figured out that it require 4,025 customers

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
at 75 cents in this campaign.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Next, we just don't want to get them to our website,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we actually want them to sign up for our product.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Assume 3.7% of these 4,025 customers actually converted from acquired customers

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to activated customers, so the question for this quiz is calculate what was

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the customer acquisition cost per customer.
