00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Now that your done with the lectures, it's not the end.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.510
One of the things you might consider doing is putting together a lessons learned presentation.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.100
This summarizes everything you learned week to week either by watching the lectures

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.580
or hopefully getting out of the building and talking to customers.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.710
What to do with that presentation?

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.060
Well number 1 is you could post it to the forums, and we'll select the best presentations

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.330
and put them on Steve's blog.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.310
The second is you might use this as a prototype

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.439
for actually thinking about how to talk to investors and how to talk to other customers.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.240
But what do you do next after this class really depends on you.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.050
One is, it could have been a good exercise for you to decide whether

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.780
entrepreneurship is for you or not.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.970
Next could have been is you've decided whether your idea is worth pursuing or not.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.400
Third is, if you have and you still like your team members after getting out of the building

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.540
and working hard, you could decide that the next step might actually be to pursue this idea

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.660
either in an incubator, an accelorator, trying to raise some funds,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.000
or trying to take the company to the next step.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.910
What I hope is this class gave you a small taste of what entrepreneurship feels like,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.720
and what are the things you need to do.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.440
There is a ton more to learn. Take a look at the rest of the Udacity courses.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.020
Take a look at steveblank.com and Alexander Osterwalder's website,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.570
businessmodelgeneration.com.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.120
I also recommend checking out startupweekend.org

00:01:28.120 --> 99:59:59.000
for other events and other courses, and we'll see you when you're a public company.
