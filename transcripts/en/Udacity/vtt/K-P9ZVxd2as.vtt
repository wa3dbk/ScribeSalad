00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.865
At this point, we want to start translating the equation we just came up with

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:07.950
into more traditional Math language. As a reminder, here is the information, up

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:11.890
here at the top, that we decided before was going to be useful for us. And down

00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:15.860
here is that word equation that you came up with in the last quiz. We have three

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:19.700
quantities related to one another in this equation, and I would like to know

00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:23.620
right now which one of these you think we need to represent with a variable for

00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:24.832
the purposes of solving this problem.
