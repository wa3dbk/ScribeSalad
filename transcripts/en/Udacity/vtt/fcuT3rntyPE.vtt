00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.690
Let's look at the answer
to our cache tag quiz.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.010
The cache tag always contains
the entire address of the first byte.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.670
We know this is not true.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.950
The address that we supply to the cache
on an access contains the offset.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.530
And the block number.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.190
We have seen that the tag only needs
to contain the block number part,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.470
not the offset.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.030
The block always begins
at an aligned address, so

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.710
the first part of the block
actually always has zero here.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.689
So there is no need to
store those zeroes.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.430
In the cache as a tag.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.210
The tag only needs to give us the bits
that we need to identify the block,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.900
the bits that we know are always
zero are not necessary.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.290
So this is definitely not true.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.970
It contains at least one
bit from the block offset.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.770
Again this is not true.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.650
We need only the bits that
tell us which block we have.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.100
The block offset tells us where
are we within a particular block, so

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.550
these bits are never necessary.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.420
That also means that this is not true.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.780
However, the tag does contain at
least one bit from the block number.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.460
We have seen in our example
that the entire block number

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.600
can be a tag in that particular cache.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.500
In general,
it might be fewer than all of the bits,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.970
but there is a least one of them.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.570
So, this is the only correct answer.
