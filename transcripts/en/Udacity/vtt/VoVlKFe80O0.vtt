00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.000
So with these, state transition diagrams there are several problems that

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.050
we've noticed. There are too many arrows, there are too many states, and

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.660
there's no concept of nesting in them. As far as the arrows are concerned,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.079
if you've got end states and you've got impossible events. You've got n times m,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.690
a multiplicative number of possible arrows.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.280
As far as states are concerned we've already indicated that the number of states

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.700
goes up with the power of the number of possible things that can be going on.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.845
As far as nesting is concerned with the example of the dialing the telephone.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:38.640
In, in essence we would like to have done the modeling by having the,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.000
the entering of the particular digits somehow hidden within that dialing state.
