To go from a source data file to what the grammar of graphics calls variables,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.109
we can use any of D3s data loading functions.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.560
Here I input .JSON.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:18.060
But you can also have put in D3.CSV, or D3.TSV to load data.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.670
And to go from coordinates to the aesthetics of our visualization, you could

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.530
either use CSS or D3 style function to attach styles directly to the elements.
