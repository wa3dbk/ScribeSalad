00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now we know that when we compare the result of the forward Euler method,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
it's going to deviate from the exact solution.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now assume that you have two numerical solutions.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
One solution with the forward Euler method of step size h1 and another with a step size of h2

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
larger than h1, and assume that these two and the exact solution almost line up.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The question then is--can we estimate the error between this numerical solution

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the exact solution that we do not know based on the difference

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
between those two numerical solutions, which we know.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So given the distance between two solutions using the forward Euler method,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
how would you estimate the error between the exact solution

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and this first solution with the step size h1?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Should it be E times the ratio, E times the ratio of the difference to the first step size,

00:01:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
E times the ratio of the first step size to the difference, or E times the inverse ratio?
