Social psychology is an area that many students find endlessly fascinating.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.295
Which isn't surprising, because we're humans. We're social creatures. When

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:12.630
we're infants, we need other people to take care of us or we wouldn't survive.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.798
So it comes as no surprise that other individuals actually can influence how we

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:20.518
think, feel, and behave. And that's what social psychology is. It's the study

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:24.412
of how other people affect our thoughts, behaviors, and feelings, and in fact,

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:28.070
as you're going to see, it's not only the actual presence of other people that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.460
can affect us. It's the perceived presence. So people who aren't even there can

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.072
affect how we think, feel, and behave. Let's go to Susan for more detail about

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:38.940
this lesson.
