00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.710
We will be using three different
text books in this course.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.640
For the first mini course, we will be
using Python for Finance by Hilpish.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.845
&gt;&gt; In the second mini course, we will be
using a book I wrote with Philip Romero

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.360
titled What Hedge Funds Really Do.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.730
It's a thin book, but

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.310
it covers a lot of important material
that I think you will enjoy.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.230
Finally, in the last mini course,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.440
we will be using
Mitchell's Machine Learning.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.795
&gt;&gt; The good news is if you're
taking the Machine Learning course,

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:28.310
you'll already have that book.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.990
So you don't have to buy it again.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.420
I also wanted to mention that we're not
going to cover all the material in these

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.080
books, so you don't need to
worry about being overwhelmed.
