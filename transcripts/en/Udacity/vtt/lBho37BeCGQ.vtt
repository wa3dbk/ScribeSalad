00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.080
Let's look at the solution for
a write-back cache quiz.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.730
When we have read A, we're going to
check the tag and the valid bit.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.930
The tag matches A, but
the valid bit is 0, so this is a miss.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.580
Now, we have one miss.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.720
We will make the valid bit be 1.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.660
The tag becomes A.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.130
This is a read, so the dirty bit is 0.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.580
Note that the fact that
the dirty big was one,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.040
doesn't matter here because
this was not valid.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.780
So it simply doesn't matter what's here,
if valid bit is zero for that line.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.600
Next, we read B.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.560
We check the tag and the valid bit.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.550
The tag is a mismatch,
so this is a miss.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.570
We have a miss, we need to kick out A.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.200
For that, we check the dirty bit.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.000
It's zero, so
we don't have a write back.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.120
We replace A with B here.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.810
The valid bit is 1.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.740
The dirty bit is 0
because this is a read.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.730
Next, we have a write to B.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.160
Check the tag and the valid bit.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.200
This is a hit, so it's not a miss.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.460
Because this is a write,
we set the dirty bit.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.450
Next we read C.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.290
Check the tag.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.960
Mismatch.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.250
This is a miss.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.790
We need to replace B.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.240
So we check, is it dirty?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.570
Yes, it is.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.090
We need to write back B to memory.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.120
Then, we can bring in C.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.310
Set its valid bit to 1.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.670
And because this is a read,
the dirty bit becomes 0.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.290
Next, we read D.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.410
It's a miss.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.180
We need to kick out C.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.310
C is clean, so
we don't have a right back.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.210
We just bring in D and
overwrite C in the cache.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.850
It's a read, so the dirty bit is 0 and
the valid bit is 1,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.090
because the tag is valid.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.140
Next, we have a write to D.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.220
It's a hit, but
the dirty bit changes to 1.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.830
So overall,
we had 1 write-back and 4 misses.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.440
And the state of the cache is that
the valid bit is 1, the dirty bit is 1,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.360
and the tag corresponds to D.
