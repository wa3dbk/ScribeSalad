00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.320
How is the operating system
able to meet the requirements

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.460
that we have identified for it?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.400
And one of them is this requirement
that the trusted part be isolated and

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.900
not be tampered with by the untrusted
application or the user code.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.280
For us to be able to do that,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.640
we're going to see that we going to
need help from the hardware.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.540
Okay so,
remember operating system layered on top

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.020
of the hardware that we have.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.940
But, the hardware has to implement
certain functionality and that

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.050
has to do with protecting memory where
the trusted system is going to reside.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.910
And so
the hardware is going to help us protect

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.960
the trusted part of the system
from untrusted applications.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.760
And that is actually going to be

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.410
the reason we're going to able to
isolate it or make it time for proof.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.370
When you talk about isolating then,
we also ever talk about, well something

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.570
has to be different when you're
executing user or application code.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.390
Worse is when you actually go into the
operating system or when your executing

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.390
their trusted software that
makes up the operating system.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.390
Well the hardware actually's going to
do something else for us that

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.300
processor that is executing actually
is going to execute in different modes.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.330
Execution modes say either
I am executing user code

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.670
that is in our trusted, or
I am executing system code.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.040
So the processor is actually aware of
what kind of code it is executing.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.840
So one obvious thing we can do
when it's executing user code for

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.660
example the process I'm in user mode.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.380
I shouldn't be touching anything that
belongs to the operating system or

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.170
the trusted base that we have.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.180
The trusted computing base that we have.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.520
When I'm executing in the system mode.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.360
Then I'm allowed to access the code and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.630
the data that makes up
the trusted system.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.240
So the hardware is sort of aware of
what is going on at a given time.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.920
In particular what execution
mode is it running in.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.060
The execution mode for

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.900
this goes by a different name it
is also called execution rings.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.280
So ring is sort of think about
a privilege level in some sense.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.220
When you are in the system mode,
you have the highest privileges and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.280
there could be many of these in fact
several processor architectures support

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.650
more than two.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.060
And I'm just talking with user and
system.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.640
But, the innermost ring, where
the trusted computing base resides,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.710
the most privileged.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.850
As you move out of that, you, for
example, could move into the user ring.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.040
And then your privileges are reduced,
because you can't access what

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.250
can be accessed by being in
the trusted computing base.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.880
So this execution mode that we're
talking about, whether you're in system

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.510
mode or user mode, you can also
say you are in the ring that

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.580
you reside in when you are in system
mode versus the user ring, or mode.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.240
So it goes by different names,
either execution modes,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.180
system, supervisor,
a variety of these names.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.030
But the idea here is
that the processor for

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.690
the hardware knows that it's,
you know, execution state is such

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.580
the state indicates the mode
that we're talking about.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.040
So it's either running with higher level
of privileges, it can do certain things

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.047
that it's only allowed to do when
it's running the trusted code, or

00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:24.530
it's executing the non-trusted or
untrusted code when it's in user mode.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.439
So again, memory protection but
then this processor being aware of

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.770
what its execution mode is, that's
something else that we're going to need

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.980
to meet the trusted computing base
that we had identified for ourselves.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.270
So, if you are in different modes,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.150
we said you should be able to do more
things when you are in the system or

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.450
more privileged mode, compared to when
you are in user or less privileged mode.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.630
Well, certain hardware instructions,
they're called privileged instructions.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.060
They can only be executed when the
processor is in the inner most ring or

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.050
the most privileged ring or
is in the system mode.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.310
Or ring zero it's called.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.400
Zero is the most privileged and
you go out, zero, one, two, three and

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.330
become less privileged.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.220
So privileged instructions
are special instructions

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.050
that you cannot execute when
you are in the user mode.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.200
Okay lot of times these
instructions sort of

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.120
help you figure out what parts of
memory you access for example.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.220
Or these are hardware devices
that we have need to control.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.080
These kinds of instructions
direct access to the hardware

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.562
we said is not available to user code.

00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:39.220
Similarly what parts of memory you
can access can not be manipulated

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.050
at user level.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.580
If it could be then you can go
access somebody else's memory.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.070
So those kind of actions require

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.690
user instructions that can only
be executed in the system mode.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.500
And these instructions are called
privileged instructions or instructions

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.670
that can be executed in high privileged
level, a ring or more that you're in.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.200
So one of the ways in which
we're going to be able to meet

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.220
the requirements that we identified for
a trusted computing base is by

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.210
making use of a number of different
things the hardware does for us.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.140
It has memory protection,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.100
it gives us these execution
modes we're talking about.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.980
It also has special instructions
that cannot be executed

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.770
when we are not in the right mode.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.070
So, with this support from the hardware,
we will see we will be able to do

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.140
isolation or the tamper resistance
that is one of the requirements for

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.280
a trusted computing base.
