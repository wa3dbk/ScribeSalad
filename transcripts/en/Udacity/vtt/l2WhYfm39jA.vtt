00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.817
When x equals 1, I find that P of x equals negative 65. Since this isn't equal

00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:11.670
to 0, 1 must not be a 0 of this function. Let's check out 2. Sure enough, when

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.402
we plug in 2 for x, we get a value for the function of 0. That means we can put

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:22.942
a y in the rightmost column and, lucky for us, stop working. We found our first

00:00:22.942 --> 00:00:24.448
0 on this list.
