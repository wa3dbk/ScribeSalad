00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:03.410
The correct answer for this formula is 1, 3, 3, 1

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.970
and you plug them in, you can see it’s correct.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.301
This is actually called a Pascal Triangle. If you

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:10.176
have never seen this before, you can check it on

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:14.176
Wikipedia. It’s actually quite easily calculated.
