00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.670
In fact, interdomain routing can oscillate indefinitely. To see why,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.880
consider the following 4 AS topology, where each AS specifies

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.450
preferred paths, presumably via local preference. So each AS prefers

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.170
the AS in the clockwise direction, rather

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.770
than the shorter, direct path. Now it's pretty

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.120
easy to see that there's no stable

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.270
solution. Let's suppose that we started off with

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.620
everybody selecting the direct path. Well, in this case, any one of these ASs

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:37.110
would notice that it has a more preferred path. So for example, AS1 would see

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.560
that because AS3 has picked the direct path, then, in fact, it could prefer

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.390
1 3 0. Now we enter into

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.220
a situation where oscillations can occur indefinitely. Similarly,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.590
here now AS3 sees that it has a more preferred path, 3 2 0, so it might

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.032
switch to that. In doing so, it breaks AS1's path. 1 3 0 no longer

00:01:01.032 --> 00:01:04.550
works. So AS1 has to switch back to

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.080
its less preferred direct path, but now we're

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.910
in the same situation all over again. Because

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.180
now AS2's preferred path becomes available via 1,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.530
so AS2 now reroutes, and AS3's most preferred path, 3 2 0, no longer works. So

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.350
it must switch to the direct path. Now,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.780
it's very easy to see that this oscillation

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.970
continues ad infinitum. This particular pathology was first

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.750
discovered by Varadhan, Govindan, and Estrin, in a

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.210
paper called persistent route oscillation in interdomain routing,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.130
in 1996. Later, Tim Griffin formalized this pathology and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.700
derived conditions for stability. Those stability conditions

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.350
came to be known as a BGP

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.600
correctness property called safety. It turns out,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.760
that if ASs follow the ranking and export

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.370
rules that we discussed, that safety is

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.260
guaranteed. But, there are various times when

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.540
those rules are violated. Business relationships, such

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.270
as regional peering, and paid peering can occasionally

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.990
cause those conditions to be violated. So as it

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.020
turns out, to this day, BGP is not guaranteed to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.160
be stable in practice, and many common practices result

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.090
in the potential for this type of oscillation to occur.
