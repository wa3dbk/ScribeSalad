00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.546
Now, you can imagine that if I have a linear factor that has a negative

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:07.390
coefficient in front of the X that I can actually pull that negative out and

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.482
instead write the factor in an equivalent from with a positive coefficient for

00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:15.562
X. The negative can be reflected in the other factor that we're multiplying by.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:19.472
This basically means that I can choose which coefficients go in front of our X

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:23.618
term. And if I want, I can decide that I want those to be positive. That's

00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:27.876
definitely what I would prefer, just for ease of looking at our factorization.

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:31.914
So let's just go ahead and remove the negative number pairs that multiply to

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:35.759
equal 6. This makes our lives much easier. Now we only have two pairs of

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:39.904
coefficients to check to put in these slots instead of four. So let's do just

00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:44.417
that. Let's check them. I've written out for you two possible ways of factoring

00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:48.710
our original expression of 6x squared minus 7x minus 5. Actually only one of

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.802
these 2 ways is possible because you know that only one of these combinations of

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.801
coefficients for x actually works. So for the one that works you're going to

00:00:56.801 --> 00:01:00.833
figure that out by figuring out which number belongs here and here or here and

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:04.864
here depending on which one is right and then on the equation that's not going

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.721
to work at all based on these first 2 coefficients. You're going to simply

00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.984
bubble in wrong for the 2 constant term slots. So basically, try out each of the

00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:17.010
4 numbers that are written down here, which you notice are the 4 different

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.212
factors of negative 5 that you found earlier. And once you find out which one

00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:25.525
works, fill in the proper numbers and then rule out the other entire equation.
