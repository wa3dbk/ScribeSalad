00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.149
It'll be really great if we could draw the graph of Athena's function, and we

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.390
are actually really close to being able to do that. First however, I'd like to

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.849
know what domain makes sense for the concert hall situation. This is the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.062
original equation we had, written in a slightly different form, since I've

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:19.702
Factored out a two from both the numerator and the denominator. It's important

00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:23.733
to remember here what our variables stand for. T of course is the reverberation

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:28.935
time, measured in seconds as a matter of fact. And X here more importantly,

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:34.380
stands for the depth of the stage in the concert hall measured in feet. So what

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.410
restrictions based on what x stands for, do we need to place on the values of

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.050
x, or on the domain? Use your common sense here.
