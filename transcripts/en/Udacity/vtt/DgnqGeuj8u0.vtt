y to the 7th times y to the negative 3rd is just y to the 4th power. Remember

00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:11.614
that shortcut we learned before, for any numbers n, a, and b, n to the a times n

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:17.235
to the b is just equal to n to the a plus b power. So here, all we need to do is

00:00:17.247 --> 00:00:21.102
add our exponents together, 7 minus 3 is equal to 4.
