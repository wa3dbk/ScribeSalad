00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.330
Here's the whole vertex shader. There are two changes to the previous solution.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.280
A temporary normal is copied from the new position before this position is

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.385
translated away from the origin. This new normal is then used to compute

00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:14.860
vNormal which is the model view shading normal.
