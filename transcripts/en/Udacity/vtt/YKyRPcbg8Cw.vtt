Collaboration is awesome, but
remember, your goal is to learn.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.080
With so many resources
available to you on the web,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.630
you will inevitably find yourself
using code snippets you found online.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.270
It is very important to learn how
code works before you use it.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.670
Keep in mind,
if you are helping someone,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.180
make sure to explain your thought
process to them so they can also learn.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.090
And never post full code solutions.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.770
Finally, it's important to follow
code attribution guidelines

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.750
whenever using pieces
of someone else's code.
