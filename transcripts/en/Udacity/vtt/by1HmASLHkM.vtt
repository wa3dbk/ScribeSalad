00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
As we saw in the quiz, there are three things that our basic machine model needs to have.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.060
One is the memory, the second one is some sort of input/output capabilities,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.890
and finally, we need to have certain programming capabilities.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.329
There's a lot of different models that have these capabilities, but in this course,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.290
we're going to use a model called the RAM, and RAM stands for Random Access Machine.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.720
So, there are many different ways of defining a Random Access Machine, and we'll use a model

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.000
similar to the one defined by Steven Skiena and his book, The Algorithm Design Manual.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.070
The first thing that the RAM has is the memory

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.830
and that memory can of course be used for input, for output, and for holding the program

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.560
that the RAM is running on, but as simplification,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.600
we're going to split the memory into three parts.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.790
We're just going to use this memory here for intermediate results and output,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.250
and we're going to have a separate memory for the input and a separate memory to hold the program.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.209
And, these two memories here on the left side are read only meaning that the RAM cannot modify

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.460
the input, it can only read the input, and the RAM can also not modify the program.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.930
It could only read the program, and usually, when we will talk about the memory requirements

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.850
of an algorithm, what we will be talking about is how much of this memory here the RAM is using.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.060
Generally, there is no limit of how much of this memory here we have

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.550
so we always have as much as we want, but the memory is divided into single cells,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.780
and each of these cells has a limited capacity so each of these cells

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.960
cannot have arbitrarily large values, but there are as many cells as the algorithm needs.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.620
Now, if we're running a program on the RAM, what we're mainly interested in is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.860
the time that this program is going to run for a given input,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.630
and there are basically three rules for how long the RAM requires to execute a program.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.950
Simple operations such as adding two numbers, multiplying them, or executing an if or for.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.260
Those all take one time step.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.490
If you have a loop in your program such as a four-loop, this will count

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.410
not as a simple operation but count as often as it runs.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.390
So, if you have a loop that executes a simple operation 100 times,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.160
that will count as 100 time steps, and finally, you' ll also get something for free accessing memory.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.290
So, reading a part of the input or writing something into a memory cell here, that is free.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.620
That means that actually takes zero time steps.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.340
And these three rules give us a simple way of determining the running time of an algorithm

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.890
or program or also of comparing the running time of two programs because all we need to do

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.290
is count the number of time steps that we expect the RAM to execute for a given input.

00:02:48.290 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's practice this for a little bit.
