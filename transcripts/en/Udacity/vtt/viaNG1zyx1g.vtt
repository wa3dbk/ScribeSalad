00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.027
In consistent hashing, the main idea is that the

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:07.181
keys and the nodes map to the same ID space.

00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:10.297
So, what we're going to do is, create a metric

00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:13.495
space, such as a ring, and we'll put nodes on

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:16.447
this ring, and the idea is that these nodes

00:00:16.447 --> 00:00:19.614
each have some ID. Now the keys should also map

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:22.398
to the ID space. So in this case, just

00:00:22.398 --> 00:00:25.522
for the sake of example, let's suppose that we have

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:30.593
a six bit ID space, so ID's might range from zero to 63. Now you can see that

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:34.034
the nodes have ID's, and the keys also have

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.881
ID's in the same space. A consistent hash function

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:41.407
will assign the nodes, and the keys and identifier

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.437
in this space. A hash function such as shah

00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:48.180
one might be used to assign these identifiers. In

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.120
the case nodes the ID might be a hash

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.670
of the IP address. In the case of keys,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.230
the ID might simply just be the hash of a

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.300
key. Both of these hash operations create ID's that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.030
are uni-formally distributed in the ID space. The question now

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.020
is how to map the key ID's to the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.850
node ID's, so that we know which nodes are responsible

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.220
for resolving the look ups for a particular key.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.640
The idea in chord is that a key is stored

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.820
at its successor, which is the node with

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.760
the next highest ID. So, for example, the key

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.640
corresponding to the key ID of 60 would be stored at the node with the node ID

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.042
of one. Similarly for the key with the key ID of 54. Forty-two would be stored

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:41.827
at the node with the node ID of 43, 17 at the node with 32, seven and five

00:01:41.827 --> 00:01:44.141
at the node with ID of 10, and

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:47.953
so on. Consistent hashing offers the properties of load

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:51.463
balance, because all nodes receive roughly the same

00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:54.816
number of keys and flexibility. Because when a node

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:59.226
joins or leaves the network, only a fraction of the keys need to be moved to a

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:02.690
different location. You can actually prove that the solution

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.110
is optimal. Meaning that the minimal number of keys

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.150
need to be remapped to maintain load balance

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.260
when a node joins or leaves the network.
