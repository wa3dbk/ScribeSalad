00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.410
This work would not be correct, since we know that four-eighths would be equal

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.546
to one-half. More importantly, we know that this step cannot be correct. The

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:12.377
student tried to simplify terms in the numerator and in the denominator.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:17.220
Remember terms are separated by addition or subtraction. We cannot cancel terms,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.960
but we can cancel factors. Factors are numbers or variables that are multiplied

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.264
in the numerator or denominator. For example, if we started with six-12ths. We

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:31.946
can rewrite the 6 as 2 times 3, and 12 as 2 times 6. We can simplify the factors

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:37.594
of 2, since these cancel out to equal 1. This would leave us with 3 6. We repeat

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:42.712
this process one more time by rewriting 3 and 6 with factors. We can cancel the

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:47.544
3s, since they make an equivalence of 1. This leaves us with one half. So

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:51.899
whenever we're working throughout this unit keep in mind that we can't cancel

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.321
terms, we can only cancel factors, things that are multiplied in the numerator

00:00:56.321 --> 00:01:01.288
and in the denominator. And finally, we know 5/8 cannot be simplified since 5

00:01:01.288 --> 00:01:06.273
and 8 do not share a common factor. So we also need to include this reason.
