00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.070
So, I've said methods aren't really magic. They're just procedures that have a

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.071
first parameter bound to the object. There are some things in Python that are a

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.320
little bit more magical than regular methods and we'll call them Magic Methods.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.919
Magic Methods are like regular methods except they get called in special

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.332
situations. The most magical of all the Magic Methods is the one called init.

00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:26.220
Init takes at least one parameter, that's the self object. Recall that, that

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.800
parameter's always bound to the object. It can take more parameters if we want.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.634
Doesn't need to. And what's special about init is it's called to initialize the

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:40.300
object. So, let's add an init method to our restaurant class. And it's usually a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.595
good idea to place it at the top of the class. So, we have two underscores on

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:50.161
both sides. And we're going to take one parameter and we'll take the parameter

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:56.191
the name. So, that means init will have the object we're initializing as self

00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:00.895
and a name that's passed in. And all we'll do in the body of init is assign the

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:05.728
name attribute to the value name. If we do this, this will ensure that all

00:01:05.728 --> 00:01:11.012
restaurants will have a name attribute. So where's the magic? The magic is that

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:16.120
this method get called when we create a new object of the class. So, let me show

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.884
you that in the interpreter. Now before we define init, we could do this. Create

00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:25.055
a new Restaurant, passing into parameters. And that would create an instance of

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:30.325
this type. Now, we get an error and the error we get is a TypeError that says

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:35.692
<u>init</u> takes exactly 2 arguments and we only gave it 1. Well, it doesn't look

00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:40.667
like we gave it any. It's getting one implicitly, which is the self object. But

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:46.248
it expects two. It expects self as well as the name. So let's give it a name.

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:52.689
Now, we didn't get an error and we'll see that mcdowells has a name attribute

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.017
defined as what we passed init. And I should emphasize, the only magic about

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:02.056
init is that it gets called when we initialize a new object. Otherwise, it's

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:06.962
just like a regular method. If we decided that a more appropriate name for our

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:11.714
restaurant would be McD's Mansion of Metameat, well we could call init method,

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:16.442
passing in that new string, perfectly okay. And now, our name has changed to

00:02:16.442 --> 00:02:20.671
this value. When I said it's perfectly okay, I mean that it's correct. We don't

00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:24.676
get an error from the interpreter, but it's bad form to do this. If we want some

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:28.460
of the code in init to be used other than initializing methods. Well, we should

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.217
define that as a separate method. It's confusing to call init.
