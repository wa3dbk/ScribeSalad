Alright, so I won't reveal the answer just yet.Let's go through the math. I know

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:10.341
if college cost stay the same, I'd have a 100% of 22,000. That would just be

00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:15.652
22,000. I am going to increase that amount by 4.8%. So I need to find a 104.8%

00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:20.445
of the cost of college. Percent means divided by 100, so I move the decimal two

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:25.875
places left. Of means multiply and the cost of college is $22,000. Now I'm going

00:00:25.887 --> 00:00:30.673
to multiply these two numbers together and I get $23,056. Hopefully you're

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:35.830
enjoying some education at a little bit less price than that. Alright, nice work

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:41.175
on that quiz. And that concludes our work with decimals and percents. Great job.
