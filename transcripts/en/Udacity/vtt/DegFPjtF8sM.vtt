00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.808
The inverse of f of x equals log base 2 of x is f inverse of x equals 2 to the

00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:10.085
x. The base of the logarithmic function becomes the base of the exponential

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:15.370
one. If we have f of x equals log based 10 of x, then that means that f inverse

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.579
of x equals 10 to the x. Again, they have the same base.
