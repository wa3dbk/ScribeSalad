00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.190
The answer is q of p of n. It's tempting to think, that we run M,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.990
and then we run N, so the running time should be the sum of the two polynomials.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.940
The trouble is, that this doesn't account for

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.900
the possibility, that the output of M, could be much longer than the input.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.340
In fact, it could be almost p of n. Most of the program's instructions,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.110
could have been print statements or rights to the end of the tape for

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.070
Turing machines. So that the input to n, is p of n long.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.340
N would then take q of p of n time, and that becomes the dominant factor.
