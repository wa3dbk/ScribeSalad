00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.810
So thus far, we have seen, two examples with

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.010
classes. One, when we drew shapes using Turtles. And

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.920
then the other one, when we sent out text

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.710
messages using Twilio. Now, when we created shapes using Turtle.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.090
We hold a line of code that read, brad

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.880
is equal to turtle.Turtle(). Now, what we are really trying

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.840
to say with this line of code here, is

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
that inside Python, there is a file called turtle, and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.640
inside that file, is a class called turtle. There

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.720
it is. And when we try to access that

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.180
class using this statement, specially with this, open, close

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.950
brackets. What we are really doing behind the scenes, is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.290
calling the, init function defined inside the class. And

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.360
what this function init does, is that it initializes, or

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.910
creates space in memory for a new instance, which

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.720
we called, brad. Brad is an object or instance of

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.020
the class turtle. This instance brad, can then

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.880
do things defined inside the class turtle, like,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.440
move the turtle forward. Similarly, when we, write

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.940
a line of code that says client is

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.950
equal to, rest.TwilioRestCclient(). What we are really trying

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.900
to say, is that, inside Twilio, there is

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.630
a folder called, rest. And inside that folder,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.920
is a Python file which has a class

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.600
called TwilioRestClient. Now, when we call this

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.780
line of code, the one where we access

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.980
the class, TwilioRestClient(), with these open-closed brackets,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.945
what we are really doing, is calling a

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:33.450
function,init. Defined inside that class TwilioRestClient. And

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450
what this function in it does, is again

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.080
initializes or creates spaces in memory, for

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.970
an object or instance of that class, TwilioRestClient.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.080
We call that object, client. The object

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.050
client, can then do things defined inside that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.780
class, TwillioRestClient, like send smses or texts. So,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.390
in summation. You can think of a class,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
as a blueprint of a building. Now, this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.690
blueprint will have certain pieces of information about

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.700
the building, like a number of rooms in

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.900
the building, the area under the building etc.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.620
Now we can use the same blueprint, to build

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.860
multiple buildings. For instance, a residential complex with yellow walls

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.300
and an office building with, blue walls. Similarly, a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.290
class. Let's take the example of class Turtle that we've

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.980
used thus far. Now, this has information about the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.890
turtle, for instance, how to make the turtle move forward,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.010
how to make the turtle turn right,etc. Now, we

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.430
can use one class as a blueprint or a template

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.920
to create, multiple instances like Brad and Angie.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.570
Now, these instances. They can do things that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.290
are defined inside our class or blue print.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.440
Things like, move forward, turn right, and draw

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.160
a circle. Now, recently, we've seen another class,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.080
and this class is called Twilio Rest Client.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.930
Which I have just abbreviated here for lack

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.500
of space. This class, has information about how

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.570
to connect with Twillio and send a text

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.560
message. And from, this blueprint. We can then create

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.530
an instance called, client. Client can then do

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.690
things that are defined inside the class, like, send

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.950
out texts. So you can think of a

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.700
class, as a blueprint, which have some basic information

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.940
defined inside of them. And you can think of

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.330
its objects, as examples or instances, of that blueprint.
