When we have a greater than inequality, we get a union. Notice that f could be

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.836
greater than 5, or f can be less than negative 5. Just like in the absolute

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:13.146
value equations, we have two inequalities. One with a positive answer and one

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:17.481
with a negative answer. But for the negative answer we had to reverse the

00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:22.130
inequality sign. This will come up in problem solving. But, what about a less

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:27.009
than sign? Here, we have the absolute value of a number is less than 5, so we

00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:31.505
want all the numbers whose distance is less than 5 from 0. So, let's have

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:36.409
another check. What sets of numbers satisfy this less than inequality? Choose

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:37.381
the best answer.
