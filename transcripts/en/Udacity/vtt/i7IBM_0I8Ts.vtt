00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through these together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is well-formed HTML, we're beginning the bold tag.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It ends after the word "really." This looks great.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Unfortunately, in this next sentence we end the bold before we start it,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then we start it over here with Eric Blair.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's not going to work out well. I will show you in just a minute what that looks like.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Here, we begin the bold tag and then we have lots of space and then the word "really."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It turns out that is totally fine.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Web browsers use the same sort of techniques we talked about in the last unit

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to break up sentences like these into words based on white space.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
All this extra space doesn't matter.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Finally, down here we start bold at the beginning of the sentence,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so all the of these words--George-Orwell-was-really-Eric-Blair"--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
they're all bolded. Notably "really" was bolded as well, so this works out.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's go see how this plays out.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Here we have the first option--"George Orwell was really Eric Blair"--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and really is definitely bolded.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If I reverse these, it's harder to interpret.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This bold tag closes nothing. It's ill-balanced. This makes me super unhappy.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But this next one applies to "Eric Blair," and then falls off into the end of the universe.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This isn't very good.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I can put huge numbers of spaces here, and as we see,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
this does not influence the rendered web page at all.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Then in this version I have the tags at the start and the end of the sentence,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and the whole sentence is bolded.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
George Orwell is perhaps best known for writing 1984,

00:01:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and I hear that HTML has always been at war with JavaScript.
