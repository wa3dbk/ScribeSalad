00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.910
We know that we can not use the product property to combine either of these

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.770
pairs of logs, since remember they have different basis. However, let's try

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.030
grabbing our calculator and seeing if we can add them. To add log base 10 of 4

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.740
plus natural log of 5. I start out by pressing the log button, since I know

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.496
this has an implicit invisible ten down here as a base. You want base 10 of 4

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:31.810
plus natural log, so the ln button of 5. And there we go, we have our number.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.950
Let's write it down. So, according to our calculator, log base 10 of 4 plus

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.490
natural log of 5 is about equal to 2.211 so on and so forth. Let's try our

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.160
second combination here. So, I've got my calculator all ready, and I just need

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.751
to enter log base 2 of 5. But wait, there's no log base 2 button. What am I

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:58.380
going to do? Well, I could use trial and error. But that would be really,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.680
really hard. There must be something easier we can do. Luckily there is.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.240
There's something called changing bases that we can do. What this means is that

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.410
we'll convert log base 2 of 5 to something with a different base that we can

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.080
evaluate using a calculator. So this is a formula we can use to change a log

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.700
from being base a to base b. We have log base a of x equals log base b of x

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.490
over log base b of a. This probably feels a little bit confusing right now and

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.190
kind of abstract. So, let's try using it to see how it really works. Let's do

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.360
this first off with something we know the answer, just to make sure that our

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.475
method makes sense. I like us to change log base 2 of 8 to something in base

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:49.053
10. First things first though, what is log base 2 of 8 equal to?
