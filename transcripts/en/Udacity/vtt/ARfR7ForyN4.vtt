00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.307
The final sort algorithm we'll discuss is one of the most efficient ones for serial processors;

00:00:04.307 --> 00:00:07.979
this is quick sort. It is a more complex algorithm on GPUs

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.957
because of the control complexity of the algorithm, so let's recap what the quick sort algorithm does.

00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:17.987
First, it chooses a pivot element, one particular element from within its input,

00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:21.430
then it compares all of the elements in its input to the pivot,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.897
and it uses that comparison to divide the input into 3 sub-arrays.

00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:29.067
Those that are less than the pivot, those that are equal to the pivot,

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.150
and those that are greater than the pivot, and then it calls quick sort on each of these sub-arrays

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.059
and continues until the entire input is sorted.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.925
As an example, let's look at a particular array and choose that the pivot is equal to 3.

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:44.757
So what we're going to do here is compare each one of these elements to the pivot,

00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:50.478
and we're going to decide if they're equal to, greater than, or less than the pivot.

00:00:50.478 --> 00:00:54.482
Then we'll divide it into 3 arrays, those that are less than the pivot,

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:57.908
those that are equal to the pivot, and those that are greater than the pivot,

00:00:57.908 --> 00:01:01.485
and we'll call quick sort on each of these arrays and do the same thing.

00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:04.679
So when we have 2 and 1, let's say we choose 2 as the pivot,

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:08.652
then we'll divide this into smaller than the pivot and equal to the pivot.

00:01:08.652 --> 00:01:12.490
This doesn't need to be recursed because it only has a single element.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.061
And let's say we choose 4 as the pivot here, this is greater than the pivot, this is equal to the pivot,

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.312
and now we have a completely sorted array.

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:23.600
So this is a very challenging algorithm to implement on the GPU.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.005
The other algorithms that we've looked at are pretty simple to describe, and they don't recurse.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:33.343
This one is more complex, and until very recently GPUs didn't support recursion at all.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:38.062
Indeed, the GPUs we use in this class don't support recursion currently.

00:01:38.062 --> 00:01:45.190
So how can we take this seemingly recursive-only algorithm and map it to the GPU using the primitives that we've learned?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.425
So I'm bringing up this example for two reasons.

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:53.264
The first is that you have already learned all the pieces that you need to implement quick sort on the GPU,

00:01:53.264 --> 00:02:00.037
and the second is to motivate the benefits of new GPU capabilities that do natively support recursion.

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:04.976
So we can implement quick sort without recursion by using the idea of segments.

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:10.033
Recall that segmented operations, like scans, only operate within a single segment;

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.198
operations on one segment don't affect other segments.

00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:17.221
That sounds a little bit like recursion, and in fact it maps in a similar way.

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:20.457
For quick sort, when we begin to process the initial array,

00:02:20.457 --> 00:02:27.264
we're going to use distributes, maps, and compacts to eventually divide it into 3 segments.

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:32.203
We can use segmented scans to do all the necessary operations that we need to make this work,

00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:37.646
including distributing a pivot across a segment for comparisons and splitting a segment,

00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:41.413
which is similar to the way that we split on a particular bit in radix sort.

00:02:41.413 --> 00:02:45.282
Quick sort is interesting because it shows you how useful segments can be,

00:02:45.282 --> 00:02:50.461
that they can let you mirror the same approach you use in recursion, without actually using recursion.

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.930
But, and I gotta be perfectly honest here,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.829
it's really a challenge to implement and equally challenging to make it fast.

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.501
So it's very exciting that the newest in video GPUs support a more flexible programming model where kernels can actually call,

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:08.072
can launch other kernels, which makes quick sort's recursive calls much more straightforward.

00:03:08.072 --> 00:03:10.837
We're not using this new capability in the class.

00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:16.016
The Amazon instances where our code is running don't have these new GPUs that support this capability at this time,

00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:18.824
but it's really exciting, and so when we get to unit 7,

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:22.319
we'll see exactly what it looks like and how it applies to Quick sort.
