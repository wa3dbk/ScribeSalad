00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.969
So let's look at how this will work with an example.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.210
I'm going to use this simple program that takes two inputs. The

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.790
first input is a string, str, and the second one is

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.575
an integer, size. And the problem is called split. And as

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:14.363
the name says what it does is to take this string,

00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:17.491
str, and split it into sub string, into chunks of size

00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:21.550
characters each. So how do we identify some possible partitions for

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.620
this program? If we consider the input size, we can identify

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.630
three neutral partitions which are size less than 0. For example,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.259
we want to test how the program behaves. But if we pass an

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.100
incorrect size, size equal to 0, which is also a partition. In

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.390
this case, a partition with a single element. And the third case

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.540
is size greater than 0, which I will consider to be

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.960
kind of the standard case. And actually let me do a, you

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.220
know, slight aggression so when I was talking about designer bias. So

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.630
this is a case in which designer bias might not make you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.050
think of using size less than 0 because you read the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.210
spec. And you sort of assume that the size will be positive.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.556
Whereas the right thing to do when we test is to consider

00:00:58.556 --> 00:01:01.700
the complete domain rather than just parts of it. So now let's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.760
look at string, str, and let's see what kind of sub

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.538
domains we could identify for this

00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:08.670
parameter. And notice another important aspect

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.290
here is that we treat each different part of the input independently,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.760
which also helps breaking down the problem. One interesting sub domain is

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.980
the domain that includes all the strings whose length is less than

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.310
size. So all the strings that will not be displayed. Another subdomain

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.000
is all the strings with length which is between the value of

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.350
size and twice the value of size. A third subdomain is the one

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.820
including all the strings whose length is greater than twice the value

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.140
of size. And we can continue and identify more and more subdomain.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.350
The key thing here is that we have to do that based

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.180
on the domain. So we need to adapt what we just did here

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.620
based on, on the specific domain involved and on the type

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.190
of data in this domain. So at this point we said that

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.630
there were two steps. One was to identify the subdomains and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.990
the second one was to pick values in this subdomain. The values

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.320
that we'll actually use for the testing. In this case, we

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.218
do not want to just pick any value. Rather we want to

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.871
pick values that are particularly

00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:02.710
interesting, particularly representative. So what does

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.800
that mean? Well, we're going to do that based on an intuitive idea.
