00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.556
There are other points above this line that represent saving more than $100 per

00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:11.174
month. For example, after 1 month, I could have also saved $400 or after 1 month

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:16.672
I could have also saved $450 or even $500. Similar reasoning could be used at 2

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:22.238
months, I could have saved maybe $600. Or 700, so there's tons of points farther

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:27.115
above this region. Because all these y values are the amount of money saved

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:32.218
falls above this line, we can change our equation into an inequality. We want

00:00:32.218 --> 00:00:37.353
our savings amount to be greater than the exact amount of $200 plus the $100 per

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:42.919
month. So this is the inequality we can write. Notice that linear inequalities

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:48.466
contain 2 variables, just like linear equations. This allows us to find a point,

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:53.693
x and y, that satisfies this condition. For example I can use this point and

00:00:53.693 --> 00:00:58.969
plug in 2 for x and 500 for y and I should get a true statement. And when I do,

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.397
I get 500 is greater than 400, so yes this is true. Also remember from before,

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:09.875
we said that one 300 couldn't be a point for our inequality. We didn't save more

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:15.176
than $100 per month. So I need some way to represent that on the line. I can't

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:20.384
actually include the points on the line, so I'm going to use a dashed line to

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:25.527
exclude them. We know any of the points above this line satisfy our inequality.

00:01:25.527 --> 00:01:30.343
This shaded reason up above would represent every instance when we saved more

00:01:30.343 --> 00:01:34.996
than $100 in a month. Let's say you allowed yourself to save exactly $100 or

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:39.786
more per month. So now we could be greater than or equal to. Well, this point

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:44.607
can now be a point on our line. If you allow yourself to save exactly $100 or

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:49.457
more in a month then now we can include this point in our inequality. We can see

00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:54.273
that by plugging it in we get a true statement. 300 is greater than or equal to

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:59.083
300. I need to change my graph to reflect that so, instead of using a dash line

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:04.876
I'll use a solid one. That will represent the equal to part. When graphing

00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:11.311
linear inequalities, we use a solid line for greater than or equal to, and less

00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:17.551
than or equal to. If we see the greater than or the less than sign, then we use

00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:18.794
a dashed line.
