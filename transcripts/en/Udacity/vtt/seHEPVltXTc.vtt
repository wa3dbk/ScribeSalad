My name is Ellora. I am a junior in computer science at Stanford University. I

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.700
grew up in the bay area, but actually despite that fact, didn't really intend

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.370
to study computer science. I entered Stanford three years ago as a Psychology

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.580
major. And took a computer science class because my friends took them and liked

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.959
them. And I figured I had to take an engineering class anyway, so why not.
