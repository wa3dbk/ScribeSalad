00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Again, pretty straight forward.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We get the word plays, and we sort them in reverse order again

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that bgigest are first, this time by word score, and then we just take the first n.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
By doing the subscripting like that, it works when n is too big.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It works when n equals none.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, just an aside here, as the great American philosopher, Benjamin Parker once said,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"With great power comes great responsibility."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We have a great power here to go through all the words in the dictionary

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and come up with all the best plays.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, I could read in the official Scrabble dictionary and I could apply the board position

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that you saw in my game with Ken and I could come up with a bunch of good plays.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But that wouldn't be fair to my friend Ken,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
unless we had previously agreed that it was legal and fair to do so.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm not going to do that. I got to resist that temptation.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And throughout your career as an engineer,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
these types of temptations or these types of possibilities are going to come up.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Having strong ethics is part of learning to be a good software engineer.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So now, in terms of our pacing, we've achieved milestone #2.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We can stop sprinting again. We can relax. You can have a drink. We can lay down.

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We can congratulate ourselves or do whatever we want to do.
