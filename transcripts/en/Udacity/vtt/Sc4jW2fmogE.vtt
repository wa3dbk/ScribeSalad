00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.656
In this exercise, I've set-up two viewports on the screen. A perspective view

00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:07.322
and a top view orthographic camera. I should mention there's one extra thing to

00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:10.754
set on the renderer in 3JS, when using multiple viewports, renderer autoclear

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:15.246
equals false. This setting tells 3JS to not clear the screen before rendering

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:19.640
the viewport. The top view works by defining the volume and space. The up

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.866
vector for the view is set, somewhat arbitrarily, to be the plus x axis. During

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:27.130
rendering the camera position itself is set to be up one unit, looking down at

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.006
the target. The idea is to look at the target and then move back a bit to

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.906
establish the look at direction. Note that the look at and up directions should

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:39.462
never be parallel. Your task is to add two more viewports. Add a front viewport

00:00:39.462 --> 00:00:43.232
to the upper left, side the the lower right. The front viewport should look up

00:00:43.232 --> 00:00:47.695
along the positive x axis, the side viewport down along the negative z axis.

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:51.010
Both the front and side viewports should track the target position similar to

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.899
how the top viewport works. When you're done, the program should look like

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:55.450
this.
