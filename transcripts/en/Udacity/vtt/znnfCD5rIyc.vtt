00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What is this vital information that needs to go in the bug report?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In a 2008 study involving 165 developers from Apache, Eclipse, and Mozilla,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the most important facts the developers needed were facts about the problem.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
First, the problem history.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
That is, steps needed to reproduce the problem.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For instance, start preview and then open the attached file.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Second, diagnostic information.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That is, core dumps, meaning memory dumps of the final stage of the program before it crashed,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
stack traces, the functions that were active at the moment the failure occurred, or logs.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Whatever the system has recorded about the final state,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and what the program has logged so far.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Next, the experienced behavior.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is what the user saw.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
For instance, preview crashed.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Next, the expected behavior.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is helpful as a reality check.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Does the user expect the same as the developer?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Mostly, this is just the opposite of the experienced behavior.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Finally, a one-line summary.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is typically the base for searching for a bug report,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
as well as for deciding the severity of a problem.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
For instance, preview crashes when opening PDF file.
