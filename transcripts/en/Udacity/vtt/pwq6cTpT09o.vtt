00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.973
So withdrawal effects are in the opposite direction of the effects that the

00:00:03.973 --> 00:00:09.249
drug produces. Let's look at an example of heroin. So here, we will list the

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.606
effects that heroin produces. And we will see that when a person experiences

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:18.892
withdrawal, those effects are opposite. Let's start first with analgesia. So

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:23.223
heroin produces a variety of effects, we'll just look at four. One is

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:28.022
analgesia, this means it's a pain reliever. It will also produce pupil

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:33.486
constriction, meaning, people will have tiny pinpoint-like pupils. Also, it

00:00:33.486 --> 00:00:37.628
produces euphoria. In fact, this is why people abuse heroin. And finally,

00:00:37.628 --> 00:00:42.185
another effect is constipation. Now, a person who is physically dependent on

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:46.325
heroin and doesn't get the drug will now start to experience withdrawal

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:52.570
symptoms. And these are in the opposite direction, let's take a look. So the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.602
withdrawal effects would be hyperalgesia, which is an increased sensitivity to

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:03.652
pain, pupil dilation, dysphoria,as well as diarrhea. In addition, people

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:08.206
undergoing withdrawal from heroin experience what they call a terrible flu-like

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:14.124
feeling. And these withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks. Therefore it is not

00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:17.845
surprising when people go out to look for the drug to try to diminish those

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:20.309
withdrawal symptoms.
