00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.137
Here's a different type of compound inequality. This one uses the word, or. I

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.157
want any number of x that makes this inequality true, or any number of x that

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.179
makes this inequality true. It doesn't have to be true for both of them. I'm

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:16.291
going to do some leg work and go ahead and solve these inequalities. Now would

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:20.221
be a good point to pause the video and see if you get the same solutions I do.

00:00:20.532 --> 00:00:24.750
For the first inequality, we get x is less than or equal to 1. For the second

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:29.094
inequality, we divide by negative 3, so we reverse the inequality sign and we

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:33.374
get x is greater than or equal to 3. Any number less than or equal to 1 or any

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:37.907
number greater than or equal to 3 will satisfy one of these inequalities. Let's

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:42.556
see this on a number line. So, here's our number line. Any value to the left of

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:46.982
1 will work for this inequality and any value to the right of 3 will satisfy

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:51.729
this inequality. Just like all the other equations and inequalities we've done,

00:00:51.832 --> 00:00:56.428
we can check our answer to make sure we're right. I'm going to check 0 for this

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.449
inequality and I'm going to check 4 four for this inequality. Remember, 0 won't

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:06.158
work for this one, but it will work for this one. We just need to make sure it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.265
will work for one or the other. If I plug in zero for x for the first

00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:15.137
inequality, I get negative 4 is less than or equal to 0. This is true. If I plug

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.636
in x equals 4 into the second inequality, I get negative 12 is less than or

00:01:19.648 --> 00:01:24.076
equal to 9. This is also true. This is great. These solutions work for the first

00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:28.477
inequality, and these solutions work for the second. They don't need to work for

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:31.156
both, they just need to work for one or the other.
