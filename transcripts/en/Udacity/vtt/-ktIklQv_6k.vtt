00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.040
Now this process of referrals, as you can see, can be rather slow. A

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.880
particular DNS query might thus require round

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.120
trips to multiple servers that are authoritative for

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.700
different parts of the hierarchy. The blue

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.221
server is authoritative for the root. The purple

00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:21.336
server is authoritative for .edu and the

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:25.620
red server is authoritative for gatech.edu. Now supposing

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.920
we wanted to save the extra time in trouble of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.270
these round trip times. This local resolver would typically have

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.800
a cache that stores the NS records for each level

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.850
of the hierarchy as well as the A records and each

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.660
of these answers would be stored or cached for a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.610
particular amount a time. Each of one these replies has

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.180
what's called a time to live or a TTL that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.090
indicates how long each of these answers can be saved before

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.840
they need to be looked up again. Caching

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.020
allows for quick responses from the local DNS

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.370
resolver, especially for repeated mappings. For example, since

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.840
everyone is probably looking up domain names such

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.100
as google.com It's much faster to keep the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.150
answer in cache. So, given multiple clients trying

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.930
to resolve the same domain name, the answers

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.010
can all be resolved in a local cache.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.430
Some queries can reuse parts of this look

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.610
up, for example, it's unlikely that the authoritative name

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.280
server for the root is going to change

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.360
very often. So that answer might be kept, or

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.050
cached, for a much longer period of time.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.310
A typical time might be hours or days, or

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.630
even weeks. The mapping for a local name, such

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.080
as www.gatech.edu, on the other hand, might change more

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.470
frequently and thus these local TTL's might need to be

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.620
smaller. Now the most common type of DNS record, is what's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.060
called an A record, which maps an IP address to a

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.190
domain name. But there are other important record types as well.
