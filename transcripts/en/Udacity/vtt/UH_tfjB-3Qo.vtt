00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.968
Now you've seen a couple examples of the use of the and operator, so how about

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:09.549
or? We'll put or to use for drawing this Charlie flag. Again, here is my sketch

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.096
and we have blue at the top or the bottom. If Y is less than height over 5 or

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:21.210
if Y is height times 4 over 5 or larger, then the pixel is blue. So we'll put

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.316
an or operator here to join these two conditions. Once again, it's your turn to

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:29.089
complete this program. Use the or operator for the blue ones, and for the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.550
middle strip here, you get to use the and operator one more time. Go for it.
