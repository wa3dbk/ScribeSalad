00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.210
And what are some good examples
of accessible products?

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.300
&gt;&gt; So one example I like to
share are Google Docs and Drive.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.960
I feel like they've come a long
way over the past year and a half.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
And

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.040
what sorts do you feel like
they've done really, really well?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.830
&gt;&gt; Well, as you can see here
on the Google Docs app,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.600
there's a lot of good things
that they have considered.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.956
One is good contrast between
the text and the background colors.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:31.335
They allow,
they support large fonts really well.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:35.225
So that when you do enlarge the fonts
on here that essential items or

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:39.647
elements aren't getting cut off, either
able to zoom in where you need to.

00:00:39.647 --> 00:00:43.037
And they also have really have
good screen readers support.

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:47.097
Screen readers are interesting
assisted technologies to design for.

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:52.057
There's a lot to consider,
because they not only read the content,

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:54.897
like the words that are on the screen,
but they also, read and

00:00:54.897 --> 00:00:58.027
announce the different elements that
are on the screen such as buttons and

00:00:58.027 --> 00:00:59.037
links and menus.

00:01:00.157 --> 00:01:06.070
And some of the aspects of a good
experience with a screen reader and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.330
things you need to take
into consideration are one,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.270
ensuring that the way the user
goes through the page and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.040
the screen that the elements
are in a logical order.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.270
So it kind of goes left to right,
top down,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.250
if that's how the elements
are laid out on the screen.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.430
And but another key thing that is really
important is what we call the labels.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.350
Or how things are labeled on the screen.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.258
So again, getting back to
the notion that the buttons and

00:01:37.258 --> 00:01:40.010
links and
elements like that are read to the user.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.870
You want to ensure that those
have clear and concise labels.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.830
And they're very contextual.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.300
I think a good example here is,
let's say you have a screen that has,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.320
let's say, emails, or
search results on there.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.480
And you have pagination controls,
like a next and previous button below.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.120
Instead of having the screen reader just
read out next or previous, having a bit

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.710
more context, like next 50 emails,
or next 50 results, is really really

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.520
beneficial and a very small change
from the designer's point of view.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.050
&gt;&gt; Right.
I mean,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.430
I could imagine like maybe seeing a buy
button, but it's like well, buy what?

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.080
&gt;&gt; Right.
One thing that's really

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.880
important to understand is
the way screen readers work.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.000
They go through the page very linearly.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.430
And so, by the time they
traverse through the site and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.810
reach the buttons that are usually
at the bottom of the page,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.160
they might have lost some
context of where they were.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So how can I work with a screen reader?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.490
Like, where would I go to use that,
or use it with a product?

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.080
&gt;&gt; The great thing about screen readers
especially on mobile is that they

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.970
are already built in.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.940
So if you have an Android or
Apple phone, you can easily go to

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.630
the settings and within there,
there are accessibilities settings.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.841
And you can turn on Talk Back for
Android and in Apple, it's Voice Over.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:03:00.400
And what I tell everybody is, turn that
on and try to use your phone for a day.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.070
And get that experience
doing your daily tasks,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.830
but only using a screen reader and the
key there is to not look at your screen.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.300
So closing your eyes or
dimming your screen for a day and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.150
just see if you can achieve
your everyday tasks.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.100
&gt;&gt; Wow.
That sounds pretty tough.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.960
What sort of other concerns are there
for maybe mobile accessibility?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.540
&gt;&gt; I think one of the unique things
about mobile is, it's a touch screen.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.510
So one key thing to keep in mind
are the touch target sizes and

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.230
ensuring that they're large enough.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.970
And this isn't just for
people with disabilities.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.750
We all have different shaped hands and
levels of dexterity.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.460
And so considering that, and
that ensuring that you don't need

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.210
a small pen tip to actually
focus in on a button or

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.860
something like that is extremely
important and valuable.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.280
&gt;&gt; And what other considerations
are there for accessibility?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.450
&gt;&gt; Well, there's definitely a lot more,
but I think one other

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.260
important one that we touched on
a little bit before is color contrast.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.540
And I think,
it's It is a good one to focus on,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.080
because you can focus on it early
just in the design and mock stage.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.040
And it's an easy thing to consider.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.590
And so there is a specific Color
Contrast Ratio that you need to meet

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.640
in order to achieve these standards.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.839
The great thing about this is, there's
a ton of online Color Contrast Checkers

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.000
that you can simply plug in your
hex codes of your text color, and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.410
your background color, and
see if you meet these, these standards.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.940
So it's really easy, and again,
just something you can take care of and

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.040
think about really early
on in the design process.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
