00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.372
40 is still above the mean of sample means, so the z squared will still be

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:13.068
positive, but it's going to be a lot more because the standard deviation is

00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:21.590
less. So, we have 40 minus 37.72, divided by 1.01. Smaller denominator, bigger

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.073
quotient. So, this gives us 2.26, approximately.
