00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.300
Okay, so we've looked at a number of different ways

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.020
of interacting with MongoDB collections. We've looked at, how we go

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.070
about inserting documents into the collection and a number of

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.220
different ways of querying a collection to find documents of interest.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.980
We're now going to turn our attention to updating. And

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.980
by that, I mean making modifications to existing documents in a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.760
collection. There are several ways to do this in MongoDB. The

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.190
one that we're going to look at here, is the use

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.480
of the save command. Now in PyMongo, this is

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.381
actually a method on collections objects. Save does one

00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.030
or two things. If the object we pass to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.260
it already has an underscore ID and a document with

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.380
that underscore ID is already in the collection. Then

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.770
it simply replaces the document with that ID with this

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.300
one. If there is no document with that underscore

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.560
ID or the object that we're passing does not have

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.080
an underscore ID field, then MongoDB will create a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.700
new document for us. Okay, so what we're doing

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.790
here is, querying the cities collection for the city

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.000
Munich or Munchen. And in this case, we'll get

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.527
back a single document. And the reason why we're

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:08.642
guaranteed to get back a single document, is because

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:11.094
instead of using find, we're using the find_one command.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.643
Instead of returning a cursor as find does, find_one simply

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:18.100
returns towards the first document it finds, that

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.070
matches our query. So what we're doing in

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.910
this code, is modifying this city document, so

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.110
that it has a field for isoCountyCode and

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.270
value for the appropriate three-character isoCountyCode for Germany,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.070
which is DEU. Okay? When we call save

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.090
here, this document will be updated to include

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.600
this field. Let's go ahead and run this. Okay,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.710
and now what I'm going to do is, I'm

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.370
going to check that the document was updated appropriately. Here

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.860
we can see the document before we did the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.014
update. I did a find on it earlier. And now

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:56.766
we see this isoCountyCode field, showing up in the

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.550
document. So what I'm going to do here is look at

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.030
a few different examples, run them and then test

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.468
the results of having run them, in the MongoDB shell.
