00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.500
let's understand what content distribution networks are.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.290
I'm planning a holiday trip to India fairly

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.670
soon and let's say on the holiday trip I record some nice videos of some

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.510
of the places that I went sightseeing. And let's say I call the content that

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.790
I generated thusly. [INAUDIBLE] India trip. To

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.900
keep it simple, let me call the node

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:34.480
ID of my computer as 80. And I want to publish this video that I generated of my

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.410
interesting visits to some of the sights and sounds of (no period) India on the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.040
Internet, so that anyone on the Internet can

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.410
find it and download it. Now, how do

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.020
I name the content of my video? Well,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.910
textual names may not be very meaningful, because there

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.080
could be name collisions. So what I'm going to do

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.910
is, I'm going to create a content hash of the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.640
video, and let's say my content. Hash has enough bits

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.600
to ensure uniqueness of the hash string that I generated, I'll

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.310
call that the key. Now I have key value pair

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.720
the key is a bit string that is a hash

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.600
of the content of what I want to store and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.400
make available to everybody, and the value is my node ID

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.630
where the content is stored. let's say that the content turned out to be 149, and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.330
my node ID is of course 80. So the key value pair that I've generated for

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.310
my interesting video is 149, 80. 149 is the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.360
key, and 80 is the value. Which essentially is the node ID

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.740
of my computer where I have the content. In other words the key 149,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.750
Is a unique name that I've generated for the content

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.870
which I want to distribute to others that may be interested in looking at this

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.090
particular content. Now if you get this key value pair

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.780
149, 80, you know that 149 is the key

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.565
that uniquely names my video it shows India trip and

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:14.150
80 is the value which says where you can get this particular video from. So

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.510
you can then come to my node and get it from me. Now the question is. Where to

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.390
store this key value pair, so that anybody

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.990
can discover this key value pair. If they

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.670
are looking for Kishore's India trip, maybe I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.990
published the fact that Kishore's India trip unique name

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:43.740
is 149 somewhere. And so now, if, anybody wants to find a way of locating the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.920
server from which they can download the content

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.300
they need to get this key value pair.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.080
So, when I created this particular, key value pair, I have to find a way to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.180
place it in the internet. So that anybody can get these key value pair, and from

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.650
that, know the node from which they can download

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.340
the content. Now we cannot put this on a

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.000
central name cell because it does not scale. Because

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.600
user generated content is proliferating on the internet. So

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.730
using a central server to store. All the key-value

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.790
pairs is just not scalable. We need a distributed

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.480
solution. And this is where the idea of DHT,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.580
or distributed hash table, comes into play. The idea

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.250
is quite simple. Anyone who generates a key value

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.280
pair has to find a location. Where they can

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.590
store it so that intuitively, anybody that is looking

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.880
for that particular key will be able to discover

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.680
it. So if I want to store a key value there, what I'm going to do is find a node

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.760
who's ID is exactly the same as the key itself. Or if not, close enough to

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.220
the key that I want to store. So in

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.970
this case, the key that I generated, which is

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.710
a content hash of my India video, is 149.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.020
And looking on the internet, I find that there

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.710
is a node whose node ID is 150. Close

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.740
enough to 149, and therefore, I'm going to store

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.150
this key value pair 149,80. In this particular node

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.900
150. Now, if you're looking for my India trip

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.300
video, you know that the unique signature associated with that

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.550
is 149, and you will know because of the structure

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.430
of the DHT that the place to look for the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.670
signature 149, or the key 149, Is a node whose address

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.730
is also equal to this key value or close enough.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.200
150 is the one that is close enough so you'll

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.320
go to 150 and from 150 you will get this

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.140
key value pair, and once you get this key value pair,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.420
you will know that all the content is stored in node 80 and

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.570
then you come to me and get the content from me. This is

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.310
how content distribution networks exploit the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.710
distributed hash table technology to store content

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.090
on the internet. So that they can be discovered and disseminated to the users.
