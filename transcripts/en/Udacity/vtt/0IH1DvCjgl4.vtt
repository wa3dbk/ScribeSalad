00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.572
So a x gets bigger and bigger, our function is going to approach the line y

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:10.800
equals 2x plus 7. This is called a slant asymptote. We'll see in a second how

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.642
this shows up on our graph, but first, I'd like for us find the vertical

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:18.710
asymptote for this function. Please write its equation in this box.
