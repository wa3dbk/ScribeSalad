00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.030
Let's go back to the display message
method that we were looking at earlier.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.570
We were trying to figure out what
exactly is going on in here.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.450
&gt;From what we've learned so far it looks
like there's a TextView object, and

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.670
the variable name is called
orderSummaryTextView.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.870
Then it says a bunch of code
that we don't really recognize.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.820
But on the next line, we use that
variable prderSummaryTextView, and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.030
we try to set the text on
it to be this message.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.470
Let's find out more about how to
call methods like this on objects.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.920
When we call method on object
it has to follow this format.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.560
First we write the Object Variable Name
in this case it's titleTextView

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.160
then we add a.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.350
Then it's followed by the method name,
which is setText, in this case.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.390
This method is defined exactly this
way in the TextView Java class.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.250
The method declaration also specifies
that there's an input parameter

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.060
of a string, so we put parentheses and
then pass in a string as input.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.700
Then, we end the statement
with a semicolon.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.459
When you write this line of code,
it modifies the titleTextView object so

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.100
that it displays this on the screen.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490
The reason we use the object
variable name here,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.600
is because there could be
multiple TextViews in your app.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.379
So make sure you're calling the method
on the right object instance.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.980
When you're specifying input
arguments make sure you're specifying

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.620
the right arguments in the right order
according to the method declaration.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.460
So if there's no inputs, you would
just have an empty set of parentheses.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.820
The way we pass inputs to a method
is the same as we learned earlier in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.110
lesson three.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140
And remember to separate
the object variable name and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.450
the method name with this dot.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.450
Here's another example,
on that same titleTextView object,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.190
We're going to call
a setTextSize method on it.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.220
This method takes an integer as
input for the new text size.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.830
So in this case,
we just pass 18 as the next text size.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.510
When the Android device
executes this line of code,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.460
it's going to change this titleTextView
to have a larger font size of 18.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.260
In this example,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.540
we're calling a method on the TextView
object that is called warningTextView.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.140
The method is called setTextColor,
and it takes as input a new color.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.010
Notice that the color is
specified as Color.RED.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.670
So if we look at the documentation for

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.030
the color class then, we can scroll
down and see that red is defined here.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.290
There are a bunch of other colors
that you can use here as well.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.850
So, when you call a setTextColor, you
could call Color.BLUE or Color.BLACK.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.835
And lastly, here is an example of
calling a method on an ImageView.

00:02:34.882 --> 00:02:39.230
This ImageView object has a variable
name of welcomeImageView, and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.260
we call the method
setImageResource on it.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.135
This method takes as input the new image
that we should set on this ImageView.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.580
We specify the new image as a resource
ID, in the format of R.drawable.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.000
And this is the file name,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.610
this is just another use case of
using resource IDs in Java code.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.059
To get the full list of methods that
you can call on a TextView object,

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.867
just open up the TextView Android
documentation page.

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:08.810
You can get to it by just searching for
TextView Android and clicking here.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.110
This is a page we already recognize, and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.740
we already know about the XML attributes
that are listed on this page.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.900
If I scroll down further then I can
see a list of all the public methods

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.790
in the text view class.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.870
If you want to find something,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.210
you can just use Cmd+F, or
Ctrl+F if you're on Windows.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.900
I'm going to look for the setTextColor
method which we used earlier.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.740
Here's the setTextColor method and

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.310
it takes an integer
color as an input param.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.540
All these methods were declared as
public methods in the TextView class.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.170
That's why we can call
these methods now.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.910
If they were declared
as private methods,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.210
we wouldn't see them show up here.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.070
When you're calling these methods,

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.370
make sure you're checking what input
parameters it requires and you're

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.680
passing in the inputs in the correct
order and of the correct data type.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.040
When you're looking at code,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.130
sometimes you might not see the dot
notation when calling methods.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.150
The difference matters whether you're
inside a class or outside of a class.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.730
Let's look at an example
within the TextView class.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.540
We have the setText method defined,
as well as some other method.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.589
Say that you want to call the setText
method from this other method.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:21.040
You can do so by calling setText and
then passing in the input param.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.070
But where's the dot and
where's the object variable name?

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.800
Well this line of is actually sort for
this.setText("Hello").

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.360
This refers to the current
object instance and

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.800
then setText is being
called on this object.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.880
This is a format we're more familiar
with for calling methods on objects.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.301
However the this.part is implied and
it's optional,

00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:47.380
o to make our code more concise,
we can just call setText("Hello).

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.670
So notice the difference between
calling setTexts within the class and

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.800
calling setTexts outside of that class.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.990
When you think about it,
this makes more sense,

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.380
because it's very clear which
TextView you want to set the text on,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.380
in case you have multiple
TextViews within this class.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.280
Here's another difference between
bring inside the TextView class,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.970
versus being outside
of the TextView class.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.330
Within the TextView class,
you can access private variables and

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.210
private methods.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.060
If you're outside of the TextView class,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.150
you can't use methods that are private
and you can't access private variables.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.100
Within the MainActivity class,
you can only access public methods and

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.300
public variables from
the TextView class.
