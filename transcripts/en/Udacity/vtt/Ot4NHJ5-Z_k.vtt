00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.432
Now it's about time to compute the derivative of the exponential function.

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:11.266
We already know one value--the derivative of the exponential function at X equals zero is one,

00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:16.966
because the slope of the tangent line is one, which was our definition of the exponential function.

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:21.399
Everything else can be derived from that, with the help of this equation.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:30.632
E to the power of X plus H equals E to the power of X times E to the power of H.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:38.299
This looks rather simple, but this is the key to compute the derivative for every X.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:49.166
Let's say H is a number close to zero. Then E to the H describes this part of the curve of the graph,

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:58.232
that is, of the exponential function. E to the power of X plus H describes some other part of that graph.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:02.232
One that's centered around the value of X.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:12.866
Now, this equation tells us that we can use the green part of that graph, magnify it by E to the power of X,

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:22.932
and get the red part of that graph. Of course, the same thing would happen to the slope triangle here,

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:28.699
which means the slope increases by a factor of E to the power of X.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.799
We do know that the slope at the origin is one, so this slope has to be E to the power of X times one.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.466
It's the exponential function itself again.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:49.766
This is a fundamental result. The derivative of E to the power of X with respect to X equals E to the power of X.

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:56.500
The exponential function--the exponential function, I should be saying, is its own derivative.
