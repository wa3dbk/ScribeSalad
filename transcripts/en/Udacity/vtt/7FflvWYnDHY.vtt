00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.640
I don't think there is a single
process for finding investors.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.965
I like to recommend to entrepreneurs
to stand in luck's way.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.280
They're standing in harm's way,
but standing in luck's way.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.800
That means you do things where
good things might happen to you.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.080
So perhaps going to a meet up
group around where you live

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.469
where investors are in a panel or
speaking or someone that's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.780
speak about a topic that's interesting
to you because of your domain.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.790
So going to those locations, trying to
find them, trying to connect to them,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.080
I think that's really
a really good way to do it.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.040
Another way is, at least I've
seen other entrepreneurs do it,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.650
is going to alma mater.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.370
Maybe finding angel investors or
venture capitalists that share

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.710
something common with you and one thing
can be they went to the same college.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.090
Trying to find ways to
reaching out to them.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.960
I think the key is, though, also
finding a warm introduction to them.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.250
The last thing you want to do is
emailing them with no context and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.650
with no person that can vouch for
you and or your business.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.560
And that is something that you
have to find even before you

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.240
find the actual investor
that you reach out to.
