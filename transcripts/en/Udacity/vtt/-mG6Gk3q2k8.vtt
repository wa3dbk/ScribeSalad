00:00:00.097 --> 00:00:04.876
Okay, let's see how we do this. The operator that we're going to do during the reduce is max.

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:09.781
So 2 max 1. Which one's bigger? Two. Four max 3. Which one's bigger? Four.

00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:13.604
Two max 4. Which one's bigger? Four. We're done with the reduce.

00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:16.757
So now we begin the downsweep. Remember, we start with the identity element here.

00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:19.397
And then we're going to apply the downsweep operator.

00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:22.558
In this case, we're doing a downsweep with a max.

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:25.688
So, we will copy to the left, just as in the sum example.

00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:31.384
And we will apply max to each, each of the pairs of elements to create the output to its right.

00:00:31.384 --> 00:00:36.319
So right now we're running our downsweep operator on this 2 and this 0, okay?

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:41.744
We copy the 0 over. And now we run max on 2 and 0 and get 2, okay?

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:44.422
Now, we'll drag down these intermediate values here.

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:49.244
So, we'll copy this to the left, and then 2 max 0, gives us 2.

00:00:49.244 --> 00:00:54.483
We'll copy to the left, and then 2 max 4 gives us 4, and then we'll complete.

00:00:54.483 --> 00:00:58.888
Note that the output on any particular element is equal to

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:03.364
the maximum value we've seen up to, but not including this element.

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:10.224
The max value we see here is 4, which is the max value of each element we've seen up to this point.
