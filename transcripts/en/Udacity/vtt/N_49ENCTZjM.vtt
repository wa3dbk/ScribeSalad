00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.730
For the first one, you need to type y, the caret key, the negative symbol and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.001
then 5. For the second expression, we'll start by entering z, the caret symbol

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.838
and then 6. Remember this caret will move our cursor bar from the main line up

00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:19.222
into the exponent position. We hit the right arrow key to continue back down to

00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:23.680
the main line, then we type a plus sign, then number 3, and the variable x. To

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.675
get this exponent of 3, we type our carrot symbol and then the number 3. Our

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:31.701
cursor bar would be here at this point, so we need to move it back down to the

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:36.595
main line, so we hit the right arrow key. And we finish out by typing y, the

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:41.160
arrow key, and then the number 3. For the last expression, we start by typing in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.250
the negative sign and then a forward slash. The forward slash will create two

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.870
empty spots for the numerator and the denominator. To get our numerator we

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.725
simply type 5y, the carat key, and the number 2. At this point a cursor bar will

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:58.583
be in the exponent position. We hit the right arrow key once, which will send

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:02.284
our cursor bar back down to the main line of the numerator. To move into the

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:06.718
denominator, we hit the right arrow key one more time. Now that our cursor bar

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:11.208
is down to the denominator, we type 8 to get our full fraction. Now that we have

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:15.548
our fraction, we need to move our cursor bar out of it, we hit the right arrow

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:19.888
key one more time and then we can enter in the plus sign x the caret key and the

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:24.596
number three. This will gove us our second term. Our cursor bar would be here,

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:28.195
so we hit the right arrow key to get back to the main line and then we type the

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:32.123
plus sign and 2. This gives us our full expression.
