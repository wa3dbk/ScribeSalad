00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.410
So what are the learning
goals of this class?

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.070
When we discuss our classes, learning
goals are the things that we want you to

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.030
know by the end of the class.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.560
In this class, the learning goal is
really just that you would know enough

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.250
information to contribute to
the field of educational technology.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.640
But of course,
no one can know everything and

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.690
no one can contribute
in every possible way.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.230
So what you actually need to know will
be dependent on what you want to do

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.370
in this class.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.370
You might want to design
educational technology.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.440
In which case you really need to know
the current tools out there to address

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.740
the problem you're
interested in addressing.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.930
As well as techniques for

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.650
designing sound pedagogical
strategies inside technology.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.120
You might want to do
research in this field.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.850
In which case you really need to
know the research methodologies of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.900
educational technology.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.420
As well as, what some different
communities out there have already

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.530
established in these fields.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.090
You might want to do a mixture of both,
you might want to do user testing.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.261
In which case you need some
research methodology but

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.000
some understanding of the tools as well.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.610
Or maybe you're interested in
the broader issues of educational

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.840
technology, how it intersects with
culture or personal identity.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.680
In which case you really need

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.740
to understand what those
community's theories right now are.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.790
And the different strategies they go
about to understand those phenomena.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.750
So what really matters in this class
is knowing what you need to know

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.670
to contribute in the way
you want to contribute.
