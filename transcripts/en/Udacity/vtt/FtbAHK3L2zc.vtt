00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.437
Let me show you, how we're going to be using Developer tools

00:00:02.437 --> 00:00:04.870
in this course. I'm running Chrome Canary. And I have my

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.800
phone connected. Which I have just on the side here with

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.330
me. You can see that I have the udacity side open. Let's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.390
inspect that. With the Developers tool's open, let's navigate to the

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.090
Timeline tab. This is where we're going to be spending most of our

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.490
time, in this course. Next, you can actually enable, the Screencast

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.410
feature, if you have your phone connected. So let's click, on that.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.050
And you can see a preview of. What's actually

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.070
on my screen. And as you can see, it's the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.242
same picture. To record a trace, we're just going to

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:37.880
hit reload and, wait for Chrome to capture the full

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.340
trace. Once the page is done, we have the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.500
full trace here. And you can extend and view all

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.320
of the activity, here as well. This is the view

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.320
that we're going to be using for, most of the course.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.776
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's pretty awesome.

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:52.670
But what if I don't have a phone handy?

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.630
&gt;&gt; I definitely recommend using Mobile Debugging if you

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.550
have a phone handy. But if you don't, you

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.060
can record the same Timeline data, directly on your

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.879
computer. Check the instructor notes, for a quick how-to.
