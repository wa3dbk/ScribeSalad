00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We want to concatenate everything the user has previously written,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and then on the end of it, put the new current value.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So I'm going to put all of the output we've gathered up so far from previous calls

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to document "write,"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then just turn the value of the argument into a string and paste it on the end.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that's it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We handle calls to document "write" specially, and all of our previous code for function calls

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
now goes else: if function name is not "write" then do whatever we had previously.
