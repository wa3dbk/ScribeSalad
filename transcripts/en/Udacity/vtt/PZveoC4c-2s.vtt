00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.240
Thanks, Sarah.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.500
Now once again, everything I'll be doing in this lesson,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.140
I can do completely offline.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.640
I won't internet access to create a repository or add commits to it.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.540
That's why I'm here at the forest again.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.950
First, I'm going to create a Git repository.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.239
I can either do this in an empty directory and create files later or

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.520
I can create the repository in a directory that already contains files.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.000
Right now, I'm going to use an existing directory with some recipes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.467
I'll run ls dash a.

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:26.770
And I can see that there are three recipes here.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.330
A cake recipe, a frosting recipe and a chili recipe.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.210
Notice that there isn't a .git directory because this isn't a git

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.760
repository yet.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.800
Now I'll run git init, which initializes or creates a new Git repository.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.980
Now if I run ls dash a again,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.340
I can see that the .git directory has been created.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.470
How many commits do you think the new Git repository contains?

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.210
Enter your answer in this box.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.900
And recall that commit is a snapshot out of a Git repository.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.250
If you're not sure how many commits it will contain,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.280
then just pick a number you think is reasonable.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.890
Next, what command could you use to find out the answer to

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.520
the previous question?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.290
Here's a hint.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.459
This is a Git command that you learned last lesson.
