00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.189
By setting up Van.prototype to delegate to Car.prototype,

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.979
field lookups on van instances like Amy, will fall all the way through to

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.150
Car.prototype when necessary, to find methods that are shared there.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.060
Another common mistake is to try and make an object that delegates directly to

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.530
the superclass constructor function itself.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.250
Creating an object that delegates to car,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.980
instead of an object that delegates to car.prototype, won't work,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.430
because car instances themselves are supposed to delegate to car.prototype.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.780
This is an example of a much larger problem that you should be aware of.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.270
People are forever tempted to conflate a constructor function and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.250
it's companion prototype object.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.470
But the two serve very different purposes.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.540
Perhaps the most common mistake, is attempting to instantiate the superclass

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.930
constructor as a method of creating something that delegates to its prototype.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.450
This has a nearly identical effect, with the sole exception that it runs the car

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.750
function in the process of creating this new object, which is undesirable.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.030
The object.create function is actually a rather new language feature,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.550
and before the community knew too much about it,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.600
common practice prescribed setting van.prototype to equal a new car instance.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.563
But this causes a number of problems.

00:01:09.563 --> 00:01:11.790
Notice that if we use this technique,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.800
every time we made a car subclass like van, or any other subclass of car,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.132
we would invoke car, the function, as part of that process.

00:01:20.132 --> 00:01:24.440
The superclass constructor may also require some arguments as part of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.210
it's invocation, like loc.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.990
But we don't have any way of passing them in,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.640
because the new car prototype doesn't really have a meaningful location.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.960
The only thing that has a meaningful location is a car instance or

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.930
a van instance.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.380
The abstract notion of all vans does not have a meaningful location.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.750
Since there's nothing useful we could pass in for the loc input variable,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.180
the function will run with all of it's inputs being bound to undefined.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.940
Imagine we were doing something with those inputs, like this dot access.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.800
What do you think would happen in the case where we tried dot access while

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.100
having passed nothing in particular in between the parens on new car?
