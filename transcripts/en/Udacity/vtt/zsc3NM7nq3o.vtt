00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, if I tell you the point value of every letter.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm creating a dictionary with the point values.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm using underscore to indicate the blank, but we won't be dealing with blanks yet.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, I'd like you to write the function word_score for me,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which takes a word--a sequence of letters--and tells me the total score for it

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
according to the points of each letter,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and it's not dealing with any bonuses on the board--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
any double letters, or triple words, or anything.
