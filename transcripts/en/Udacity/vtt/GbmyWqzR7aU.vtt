00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.390
Here are the errors that I found.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.180
The direction of this edge here,
should be reversed.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.100
We've exhausted all
the capacity going up.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.490
The remaining capacity on
this edge is going down.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.155
We can unsend the two units
of flow that we sent already.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:19.825
For this edge here,
there are only two remaining units of

00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:22.015
flow that we could possibly
send in this direction.

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:26.275
And there should be five
that we can unsend.

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:27.845
So, those two are wrong.

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:33.625
For this pair of vertices here, we can
indeed unsend three units of flow.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:37.300
But we actually can't send any
more forward in that direction.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.660
So this edge should be eliminated.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.680
And in this case here,
between these two vertices,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.580
we were sending two units of flow,
so we can indeed unsend them.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.020
But we only have one more unit
of flow that we can send.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.630
So this capacity should be one.
