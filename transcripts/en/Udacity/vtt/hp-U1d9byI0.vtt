We can start this problem by distributing the 4. We want to clear our grouping.

00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:08.985
So I get 4x plus 8 on the left. I want to isolate the variable on one side of

00:00:08.997 --> 00:00:13.545
the inequality sign. I'm going to choose to subtract 4x. I made this decision so

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:18.155
I could keep my variable positive. I know when I subtract 4x here, I'll wind up

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:23.752
with positive 2x. So, positive 8 is less than or equal to 2x minus 8. Next, I

00:00:23.764 --> 00:00:29.460
add 8 to both sides to isolate my 2x. So I have 16 is less than or equal to 2x.

00:00:29.584 --> 00:00:35.578
Finally, I divide both sides by 2, the coefficient in front of x. So I have 8 is

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.646
less than or equal to x, which is really the same thing as x greater than or

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:46.233
equal to 8. So I use a bracketed 8, and then I want any numbers greater than 8,

00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:50.392
so up to positive infinity. This would be the interval notation.
