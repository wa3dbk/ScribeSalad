00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.790
You've just learned how to
protect yourself from syntax and

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.230
coding style issues.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.520
But as you know, this doesn't ensure
your code does what it's supposed to do.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.910
In order to test the functionality of
your code, you should create unit tests.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.870
Unit tests are essentially JavaScript
functions that pragmatically test an API

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.630
or aspect of your project.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.020
And if this topic is new to you,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.845
I encourage you to check out the Java
Script testing course here at Udacity.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.640
For the purpose of this course,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.750
we just assume that you know
the basics over learned in layout.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.650
And thus we provided a sample
test suit as part of our sub lab.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.980
Unit test, like Linton,
are here to prevent mistakes.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.070
Wouldn't it be cool if you
could automate running them

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.290
just like everything else was set up so
far with our built.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.770
Well there's one issue with that.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.710
The unit test for your front end only
makes sense if they run in a browser.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.720
Thus, running them from the terminal
environment won't do any good.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.500
But this doesn't mean it's impossible,
it's just slightly more tricky.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.360
Here's how it works.
