00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.390
So the way that we deal with this problem
is actually exactly like we did when we

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:08.170
were doing 10-(2+3), but this time we
can't change what's inside the

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:12.671
parenthesis. There's no way that we know
of to simplify x+9, since these are not

00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:16.939
like terms. So that means, that we can't
go about doing things with the first

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:21.379
method of PEMDAS, or at least the p here
doesn't affect the way that we can do the

00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:26.246
problem, since we can't change what's
inside the parenthesis. So, that means

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:31.152
we're stuck with this second method.
Remember down here that meant applying the

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:36.022
negative sign to both the 2 and the 3 so
we ended up subtracting each of them from

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:40.831
the 10. So let's try to do the same thing
up here. We want to subtract both the X

00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:46.455
and also the 9 so we'll have 4 minus X and
then also minus 9. Rearrange and then

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:53.050
combine like terms 4-9 is -5-x so we have
our final answer of -5-x.
