00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.070
If you're still here, I assume that
means you've decided that you are ready

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.988
for this machine learning
engineering nano degree program.

00:00:05.988 --> 00:00:07.598
In which case, I welcome you again.

00:00:07.598 --> 00:00:08.660
Before we get started, though,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.700
let's talk a little bit about
what is machine learning?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.690
Machine learning has been
described as a lot of things.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.170
It's been described as the next natural
step for artificial intelligence.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.070
It's been described as
applied statistics.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.150
It's been described as
just advanced algorithms.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.060
And in reality,
it's kind of all of these things.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.200
Like artificial intelligence.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.480
It's about processing some data and
understanding data and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.500
reacting intelligently to it.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.340
Like statistics, it's about applying
advanced formulas to really

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.490
make sense and compare and
evaluate and summarize data.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.630
Like algorithms,
it operates on some data input.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.230
It provides some output.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.910
So, really machine learning
is about the next synthesis

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.750
of lots of different fields, it's
really the next natural evolution for

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.220
a lot of things you've
studied in the past.
