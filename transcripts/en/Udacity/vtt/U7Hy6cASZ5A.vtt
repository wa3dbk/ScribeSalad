00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.370
So let's understand how the RC memory model works with a concrete

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.500
example. So let's say the programmer's intent is that one

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.780
thread of his program is going to modify a structure A. And there

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.000
is another thread that is going to wait

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.600
for the modification, and then it is going to

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.920
use the structure A. So this is the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.346
programmer's intent. Right? So P2 is going to wait for

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:28.010
the modification, use it, and this guy is

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.266
the guy that is modifying that particular structure

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.860
A. And of course these are running different

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.894
on processors, and therefore we don't know who

00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:43.528
may be getting to their code first. So let's say that P2 executes the code that

00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:47.158
corresponds to this semantic. That is, it wants

00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:50.380
to wait for the modification. So in order to

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.890
do that, it has a flag, and this flag has a semantic that is, 0 indicating the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.190
modification is not done, and 1 when the modification

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.910
is actually done. And to make sure that we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.740
don't do busy waiting, we use a mutual exclusion

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.670
lock. We lock a synchronization variable, let's call it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.416
L. And if the flag is 0, then it

00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:16.618
is going to execute the equivalent of a pthread_cond_wait.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:19.884
You know, pthread_cond_wait has the semantic that

00:01:19.884 --> 00:01:23.008
you're waiting on a condition variable and you're

00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.848
also releasing the lock that is associated with

00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:29.588
this condition variable. So you execute this pthread

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:34.773
wait call, and the semantic you know is that at this point, thread P2 is

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:38.173
blocked here, the lock is released, and he's

00:01:38.173 --> 00:01:41.658
basically waiting for a signal on this condition

00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:44.643
variable c. Who's going to do that, well, of course

00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:47.083
P1 is the guy that is modifying the structure,

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:49.631
so its the responsibility of P1 to signal him.

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:52.400
So let's see what happens. So P1 is executing the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.928
code for modifying the data structure A, and once

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:59.120
it is done with all the modification, then it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.032
is going to inform P2. So in order to

00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:06.610
inform P2, what it does is acquires this lock L,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.611
and it sets the flag to 1. And the flag is the one that I inspected over here

00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:14.107
to know that, oh, the modification is not yet

00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:17.311
done here, and I'm waiting on this condition variable.

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.543
So, P1 sets the flag to 1 and signals

00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:25.490
on the condition variable, c. And, you know that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.380
signaling on the condition variable is going to wake up

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.610
P2. And, of course, it cannot start executing here until

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.930
P1 has released the lock, and once the lock has been released, that lock will be

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.360
acquired implicitly by the operating system on behalf

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.380
of P2, because that is a semantic of this

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.150
condition wait here. So when I wake up,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.930
I'll go back, and as a defensive mechanism,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.510
I'll recheck the flag to ensure that the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.110
flag is now not 0, indicating that the modification

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.550
has been done, so I'm now ready to get

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.590
out of this critical section. I unlock L, come

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.280
out of the critical section. Now I can use

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.120
this modified data structure. So that's the semantic that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.620
I wanted, and I got that with this code

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.390
fragment that I'm showing you here. So the important

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.650
thing is, if you have an RC memory model,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.200
then all the modifications that I'm making here that

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.310
are modifying shared data structures can go on in

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.050
parallel. With all this waiting that may be going

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.250
on here, I don't have to block the processor

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.700
to do every one of these modifications. The only

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.630
point at which I have to make sure that

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.370
these modifications have been made globally visible is when

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.210
I hit the unlock point in my code. So just before I unlock L, I have to make

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.960
sure that all the read write accesses to shared variables that I've made here in

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.370
my program have all been taken care of

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.840
in terms of the coherence actions being communicated

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.050
to all my peers. Only then, I have to unlock it. So, in other words,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.470
this code fragment is giving you pictorially the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.620
opportunity for exploiting computation in parallel with communication.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.839
If the model was an SC memory model, then

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.769
for every read-write accesses that are being done in

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.089
modifying this data structure A, there would have been

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:29.154
coherence actions that would have gone on, and those coherence

00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:31.750
actions, each of them has to complete before you

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.060
can do the next one, and so on. But

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.930
with the RC memory model, what it is allowing

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.850
you to do is, you can do the data structure

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.030
modification you want, and the coherence actions inherent in

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.250
those modifications may be going on in the background,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.130
but you can continue with your computation until you

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.910
hit this unlock point. At this point, the memory

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.740
model will ensure that all the coherence actions are

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.910
complete before releasing the lock, because once the lock

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.340
is released, this guy's going to get it, and immediately

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.040
he'll start using the data structure that has been modified

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.265
by me. So it is important that all the coherence actions

00:05:08.265 --> 00:05:11.910
be complete prior to unlocking. So that's the intent of the RC

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.430
memory model. And that's how you can exploit computation going on in

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.170
parallel with communication if the memory model is an RC memory model.
