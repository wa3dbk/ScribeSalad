00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.494
Now remember, when we calculate the z score of any value in the distribution,

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:08.850
we first subtract the mean which shifts the distribution without changing the

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.294
shape so that zero is now the mean. And when we divide by the standard

00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:21.195
deviation, we then change the shape. Let's look at it this way. We have any

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:26.770
distribution, with mean, mu, and standard deviation, sigma. Which basically

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.707
means that sigma is one standard deviation away from the mean. After we

00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:36.400
standardize this distribution, what is going to be the z-score of sigma? Well,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.965
remember when we subtract mu, we shift it so that mu is now zero. So now, the

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:48.150
z-score of sigma is going to be sigma minus zero divided by sigma, which is

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.287
sigma divided by sigma, which is 1. So, the z-score of any value, that's one

00:00:55.287 --> 00:01:02.700
standard deviation away from the mean, will then be 1 after we standardize it.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.238
Which means that the new standard deviation of this normalized distribution, or

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:10.384
standard distribution, is 1.
