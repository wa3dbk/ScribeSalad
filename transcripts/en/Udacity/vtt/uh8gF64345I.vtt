00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.740
It turns out, consistency does matter,
and here's how.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.400
Let's say that in program order,
two cores do this.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.100
The first core is going to
store a 1 into location D, and

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.860
then store a 1 into location F.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.610
Let's say that D and
F are both 0 initially.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.550
The second core loads F into R1 and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.350
then loads D into R2.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.500
And let's say that now we
print the registers R1 and R2.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.740
Note that we can have an out of order
processor that reorders loads and

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.940
stores.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.980
So in execution order, core 1
might still be doing the stores in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.290
the same order, but core 2 decides
to reorder these two loads.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.970
Note that in a uniprocessor,
reordering of loads,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.030
if this core is not writing to these
locations, if perfectly okay, and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.710
in fact, even in a multi-processor,
most of the time it's okay.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.460
Now, let's look at what's possible
to get in R1 and R2 after this.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.500
In program order, these two loads on
core 2 might execute before these

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.540
two stores in core 1, so
we can get R1 and R2 are 0.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.400
Here, these two loads in Core 2,
although they've been reordered,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.200
can still happen before
Core 1 gets to store.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.990
So we can get the same thing.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.900
These two loads can happen
after the two stores.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.930
So we can get 1 in both registers here.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.650
In execution order, even if we re-order
them, they can execute after the stores.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.710
So we can get 1 in both of them.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.400
In the program order,
if these two happen like this,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.520
in between the two stores,
we can get R1, when we load,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.660
it's still loading the 0 here, but R2,
when we load, is already loading the 1.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.730
The same thing can happen here.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.530
If these two loads are in between
the stores, then R1 is going to be 0

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.660
because it comes before this, and R2 is
going to be 1 because it happens here.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690
And now it gets interesting.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.040
We have seen that there are these three
possibilities, so the question is, but

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.230
can we get R1 to be 1 while R2 is 0?

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.958
And in the program order,
if we consider that, it's not possible.

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:35.680
R1 being 1 means that
when we read F we read 1.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.600
That means that this load has
to come after this store.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.810
If that happens, then this load
has to be after this load too.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.360
So pretty much, if we execute this here,
then this has to be here,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.310
and that means that if we read one 1
from F, we will read 1 from D as well.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.410
So the R1 equals 1, R2 equals 0
cannot happen in program order.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.560
But here R1 equals 1 means that
this load needs to be here.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.850
And we can get a 0 in R2
if this load comes here.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.200
So if we put the stores in between the
loads in the execution order like this,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.579
we will get a situation that was not
possible in the original program order.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.900
So the programmer might have expected
that this code can never result in this,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.530
but in an out of order processor
execution on each core, it can.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.660
And note that this doesn't
violate coherence at all.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.330
In all cases, a load and
the store obeyed coherence.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.780
But do we really care about that?

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.370
Sure.
For

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.060
some obscure orderings this can happen,
do we really care?

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.860
When does it really matter that
this doesn't happen and it does?
