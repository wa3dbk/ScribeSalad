00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.420
Now that our system is aware of what
all software is available, and the most

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.270
recent version numbers, it's now time
for us to actually update the software.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.390
We do this with the command,
sudo apt-get upgrade.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.970
Once again, we have to use sudo.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.360
Remember this is an administrative task
that we have to run as the root user.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.818
After a few seconds, you'll be presented
with a list of everything that's going

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:23.865
to change on your system.

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:27.220
And this question,
do you want to continue, yes or no?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.520
We'll say yes in a second, but let's
review this information real quick.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.580
Here we have a list of packages
that will be upgraded.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.340
Some of these names look familiar.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.400
See a name python here,
python down here.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.050
But others, not so much.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.880
This early in setting up a new machine,
you can be pretty safe in just accepting

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.170
that the system is always making
the best decisions for you.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.410
Later on, when you actually have your
web application running on this system,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.020
and it's serving your users.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.420
You're going to want to take more
care in reviewing this list.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.250
And testing everything in
a non-production environment

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.200
before performing similar operations
on your production server.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.490
For now, we'll just hit yes and
we'll go take a coffee break as

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.830
all of these new versions
are downloaded and installed.
