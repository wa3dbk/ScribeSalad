00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.610
So far we've discussed the structure and
purpose of standards.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.610
The final dimension is technology.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.854
And this is particularly
applicable to messaging standards,

00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:14.771
where the messages must constructed
from data standards in a manner that can

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:17.299
be understood by the systems
that receive them.

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:19.755
We just discussed why.

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:24.710
Departments in a hospital that want to
share information with each other, so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.020
for example, an order can flow
from the physician caring for

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.070
the patient to the lab, and
the result of the test can come back.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.060
Messaging standards serve that purpose,
but now we're looking at

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.440
the technology in which those standards
are implemented and formatted.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.036
Early messaging standards
were created using EDI/X12,

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:48.790
a standard that evolved in other
industries to automate business

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.900
processes such as ordering,
invoicing, and payment.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.460
EDI/X12 was developed in the early
days of computing when memory and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.620
storage were still dear.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.980
So it is quite cryptic and
compact as you can see here.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.310
Note that with some effort,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.210
we can tell that this involves
a clinical lab and a glucose test.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.000
But most of the details are not obvious.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.520
In fact,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.420
to understand each specific field,
typically requires a reference guide.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.330
More recently, messaging and document
standards have been developed using XML,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.190
a modern syntax that is verbose, but
has the advantages of being more human

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.180
readable and
easily rendered in a browser.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.690
This is the same lab test
result we just looked at.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.446
While it's still not easy to read,
we can much more easily tell

00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:44.129
that it was a blood glucose level,
that its value was 182.

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:46.500
It says value right there.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.404
And we can see the normal ranges for
the test are 70 to 105.
