00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
For some problems, there's no constant factor approximation algorithm unless P=NP

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.990
or there are constant factor approximation algorithms

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.620
but we know certain limits for how good that constant factor can get.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.940
There are other problems that allow for what is called a Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.850
and the idea behind the polynomial-time approximation scheme is basically

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.820
that if you put in more running time in to your algorithm,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.870
and that algorithm is called a polynomial-time approximation scheme,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.530
then you will get a better solution or a better guarantee for your solution,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.160
and depending on how good you want that guarantee to be,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.780
then again certain implications for the running time you have to put in.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.470
So, for an almost perfect solution,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.700
you will likely have to put in time that is pretty close to exponential time or even exponential time

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.970
and for a solution that is--well, maybe only within a rather course bound of an optimal solution,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.660
you will need less time.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.380
Now, the NP complete problems that we have encountered so far

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.090
obviously fall either into the category of having a constant factor approximation algorithm

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.690
or admitting no such algorithm

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.720
and that is why I'm going to introduce a new NP complete problem to you now called knapsack.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.870
A knapsack is a very simple to describe.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.740
Knapsack gives you as input a set of objects such as these here

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.940
and each object has a size and a value and those are both integer number,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.130
so you have an integer size and an integer value and we're soon going to do an example for this,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.660
and then, additionally, you have given a container and that container has a limited capacity,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.420
and that capacity again is an integer,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.840
and the question you're trying to answer with knapsack is actually very simple,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.610
you're trying to ask the question,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.170
"What is the maximum value that I can put into this bag here while observing the limited capacity?"

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.760
So the total sum of the size of the objects that I select to be in the knapsack,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.790
so say I select this object to be in the knapsack and this one here

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.420
but I don't want this one here,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.650
then that means that the total size of these two objects cannot exceed the capacity of the container

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.700
and among all other possibilities of putting objects

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.250
into the container without exceeding maximum capacity,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.070
this gives me the best possible value,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.240
and of course, here for the values, we again do the sum to calculate the total value.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.280
Knapsack is known to be NP complete

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.300
and now let's do a little example for this problem just to familiarize yourself with this

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.250
and I'm going to give you a number of objects here, and of course,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.820
each of these objects has a size and a value.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.940
Now, my question to you is if I give you a container and that container has size 10,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.090
which objects out of these seven here should you put in to the container

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.720
to maximize the value without exceeding the size here.

00:02:40.720 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check all the items that you should put in to the container to maximize the value.
