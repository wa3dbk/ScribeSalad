00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.620
A class in ULM or in an object-oriented language, is a description of a similar

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.640
set of instances. Candidates for classes include domain objects,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.020
roles, events, and interactions. In the previous lesson we learned how

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.720
to use nouns as a way of giving you ideas of what are good candidate classes.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.690
In UML a class is denoted by a rectangle that is horizontally partitioned in to

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.320
three or more units. Actually, all but the first of those units is optional.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.440
The particular units which are most commonly used, are the name, the attributes,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.410
and the operations. And we'll be looking at all of those. In addition,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.190
if you wish, you could have units that describe responsibilities, exceptions,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.670
and so on. Here's and example of a UML class. There are three horizontally

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.850
partitioned units. The top one features the name of the particular class,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.870
in this case it's window, it's the window class. In the middle is an area where

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.990
the attributes of that class are described. In this case, they're attributes for

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.280
the size of the window, the visibility, and other features. In the bottom

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.460
most of the three units is a description of the operations which a window object

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.230
can provide. In this case it can display, it can hide, and so on.
