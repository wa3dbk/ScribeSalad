00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.641
Up to this point, we've been mostly ignoring the order of operations. That is,

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:07.086
we've been merely performing translations, rotations, and scales, without

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:10.488
worrying about whether one needs to be done before the other. After all, we

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:14.026
found that translations can be done in any order and these still add up to a

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:19.356
single translation. What could go wrong? The answer is, plenty. Order matters

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:24.225
when rotations or scales are involved. 3GS uses the following order to apply the

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:29.984
transforms on an object, scale, rotate, translate. In the scaling exercise, 3GS

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:34.680
first scaled the clock hand made out of a sphere, then rotated it into position.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.485
Finally, it placed this hand to be just above the other hand. It doesn't matter

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:44.693
what order you set these parameters. 3GS always evaluates them in the order of

00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:48.585
scale, rotation, and position. This is the default because it is often the

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:51.754
easiest way to produce the results you want. If you have something special in

00:00:51.754 --> 00:00:55.046
mind, you may find it best to transform in a different order. That's possible

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:58.763
and, in fact, we will later see how we need to use a different order to make our

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:03.724
clock example look really good. For now though, we'll stick with scaling, then

00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:06.833
rotation, then translation in that order.
