00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.140
Now I'd like you to find the locations of the x and y-intercept of the same

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.540
rational function. Actually, if you could just give me the x-coordinate of each

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.207
x-intercept and the y-coordinate of each y-intercept, I would be very happy.

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:16.730
Just separate your answers by commas if there's more then one in a given box.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.790
And if there aren't any, write none.
