Okay. So, there were a lot of words in that last problem I just said out loud to

00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:07.563
you. There are a lot of things to look and a lot of numbers to think about. And

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.531
many people, including myself, end up feeling kind of confused and overwhelmed

00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:15.354
when starting to work on a word problem. To help you out, here's a list of the

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:19.620
facts that I told you in our story. I'd like you to check off all of the ones

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:24.090
that we actually need to pay attention to in order to find what we're looking

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:28.675
for in the problem, which is, to remind you, the cost of manufacturing just one

00:00:28.687 --> 00:00:29.945
set of glasses wipers.
