00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.787
This is the point where our line intersects the x axis. They meet right here and

00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:09.294
this is the point where our line intersects the y axis. They meet here. Now

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:14.046
thinking back to before, what are the coordinates of this x intercept and this y

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.458
intercept? Write the numbers in here.
