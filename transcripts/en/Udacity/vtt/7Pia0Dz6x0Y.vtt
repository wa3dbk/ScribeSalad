00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.359
One thing we can do to simplify this expression, is to start out by inserting

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.946
one new set of parentheses around this first 5 times 5. That way, just like

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:12.982
we've done before, we're multiplying two things together and we know how to use

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:18.378
the product rule in a situation like this. This is just going to be equal to

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:24.155
log base 10 of 5 times 5 plus log base 10 of 5. Conveniently, we've already

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:28.915
found this. That's what we got up here. Log base 10 of 5 times 5 is just log

00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:34.412
base 10 of 5 plus log base 10 of 5. And then of course, we have to keep this

00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:38.726
last, log base 10 of 5 added on to the end as well. Now we have three log base

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:44.325
10 of 5s added together. And this is just equal to 3 times log base 10 of 5, or

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:47.196
3 log base 10 of 5.
