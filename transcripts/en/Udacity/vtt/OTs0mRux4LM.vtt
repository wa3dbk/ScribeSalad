00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.780
So the [UNKNOWN] agent figured out that handle is fixed should go

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.840
beneath object enables drinking, but not beneath object is liftable.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.440
So the agent will put handle is fixed here, in this particular explanation.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.760
This is correct. If the agent has background knowledge,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.430
it tells it that the reason handle is fixed is important is,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.270
because it makes the object manipulable, which in turn enables drinking.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.090
Then the agent can insert this additional assertion here in the explanation.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.720
Even more, if the agent has additional background knowledge that tells it,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.650
the defect of the object has a handle, and that the handle is fixed, together

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.700
make the object orientable, which is what makes the object manipulatable, then

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.790
the agent may come up with a richer explanation. The important point here is,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.215
that as powerful and important as classification is, it alone is not sufficient.

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:56.000
There're many situations under which explanation too is very important.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.910
Explanation leads to richer learning, deeper learning.
