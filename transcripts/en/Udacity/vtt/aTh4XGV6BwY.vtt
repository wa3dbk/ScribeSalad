00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here comes a simple situation in which to apply the heat equation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Assume that the heat is distributed in such a way along the length of the wire,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the temperature depends linearly on position--one end is cool and one end is warm.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you wait for a short time, what happens with the central part of that function.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Will it move left, will it stay as it is, will it move right?
