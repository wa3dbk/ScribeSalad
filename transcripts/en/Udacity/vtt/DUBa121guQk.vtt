00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.700
Let's get back to our Mount Shasta example. In this case, remember our null

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.140
hypothesis would be based on the population. So knowing which null hypothesis

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.680
to use, it can be tricky. You'll continue to keep building up an intuitive

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.060
sense of what the null hypothesis should be, depending on the situation and the

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.355
question you're asking. In our example, we now know what kind of success to

00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:29.320
expect based on the null hypothesis. And we also know what kind of success the

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.370
guide company observed last year. And now we need to test how well these

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.960
obtained sample frequencies or proportions fit the population proportions or

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.700
our expected frequencies. This is called the kai squared goodness of fit test.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.650
You might be wondering about the alternative hypothesis. The alternative

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.250
hypothesis is basically that the null hypothesis is not true. In this type of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.730
test we really only need to use numbers for the null hypothesis. As usual with

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.340
the tests you've learned about, there's a test statistic. And it's symbolized

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.550
by kai squared. Before we get into the details of this test statistic, think

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.320
about it yourself. How would you statistically show that the observed frequency

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.420
is greater or less than the expected frequency? Would you subtract one from the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.250
other? Would you add things? Multiply or divide things? I'm being very vague.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.600
But before you move on to the next video, maybe pause and think about how you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.630
would construct a statistic such that if the observed frequencies are very

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.470
different from the expected frequencies. We'd get one number that's bigger than

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.310
if the observed and expected frequencies were similar.
