00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
In the unit, we talked about a greedy approximation algorithm for vertex cover.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.110
Let's review that very quickly.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.220
So if we were to implement this algorithm in a function called greedy&lt;u&gt;vc,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.430
the first thing we would do is go to loop that checks that not all edges are already covered.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.110
Within that loop, we're going to first choose a vertex that has the most uncovered edges

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.270
and then we're going to put that vertex into the cover.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.500
Now, another step, you might choose a different vertex for this--

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.560
depending on how you traverse the graph.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.250
If you have multiple vertices that all have an equal number

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.490
but the maximum of uncovered edges in the graph.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.410
So your order with this might vary.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.260
So I'd like you to implement this entire algorithm in the function greedy&lt;u&gt;vc,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.160
where you get an adjacent c matrix as the input.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.470
Now, as output, I'd like you to return first the size of the vertex cover and then a list

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.340
containing all of the vertices that are in the cover.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.030
And again, we're not going to worry about order here because you might get a different order

00:01:01.030 --> 99:59:59.000
than what we get and we'll check for that.
