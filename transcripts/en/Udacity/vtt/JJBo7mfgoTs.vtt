00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.719
So unfortunately we're not
quite ready to be all smiley.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.462
Sebastian tells me it's going to be
a few years before I can get my own

00:00:06.462 --> 00:00:10.930
self-driving car, but
the bigger problem is we haven't yet

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.870
talked about how to
actually use a procedure.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.110
All we've done is make them.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.960
Until we can actually use them,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.180
we don't have a good reason
to be really happy yet.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.690
But we're going to learn
how to use them next, and

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.610
then we'll be back to being smiley.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.690
So now we're going to learn
how to use a procedure.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.245
The way to use a procedure,
we need the name of the procedure,

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:34.780
followed by a left paren,
followed by a list of inputs.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.590
And there could be any number of inputs,
but

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.880
it has to match the number of
inputs the procedure expects.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.480
These inputs are sometimes called,
operands.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.440
They're sometimes called, arguments.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.260
But, we're not going to
argue about that.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.910
We're just going to call them inputs.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.910
So you've actually already done
something quite similar to this.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.530
Back in unit one,
you learned about using find on strings.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.730
And with find,
you would pass in one or two inputs.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.670
The first input was a string.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.790
That was the string that
you're looking for.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.590
That's the first input.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.620
And the second input could be a number,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.380
the position where you start looking for
that string.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.270
And so we used find in many
ways in unit one as well as you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.280
used it yourself in the homework for
unit one.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.160
Find is a little different from
the procedures that you define yourself.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.550
First of all, it's built in.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.700
The other thing that was different
is that instead of just having find,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.270
we had another input that
was really over here.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.700
Right.
We had the string that we're doing

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.430
the find in,
let's say it was in the variable page.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.860
That's really another input to find.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.210
We'll talk in a later class about
why that's done differently, but

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.890
it's very similar to calling a procedure
where one of the inputs is over here,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.880
the other two are here.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.350
It's a little different from that and
we won't get into that in this course.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.690
But in a later course, you'll learn
more about what this really means.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.400
For all the procedures
that you define yourself,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.070
we won't have any object
to invoke them on.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.050
We'll just have to procedure to call and
the arguments or operands, or

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.340
inputs, as you like to call them,
to pass in.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.560
So let's see how that works
with a simple procedure.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.860
I'm going to find the procedure
Rest_of_string and

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.880
we'll give it the parameter s.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.450
So that means it takes one input and
we're going to use the name,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.480
s, to refer to the value of that input.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.980
And we'll make it return the string
from the first character to the end.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.647
So we'll use the string
indexing operator, return s 1:.

00:02:24.647 --> 00:02:29.540
This will evaluate to the string,
with the first letter removed, so

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.280
all strings from position one
until the end of the string.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.730
And that's what we return, so
that's the output of rest_of_string,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.480
is that new string that starts from
the second letter in the input string.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.340
Here's an example of how
to use this procedure.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.440
So we could call it directly.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.580
So we could say, print rest_of_string.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.770
So that's our procedure.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.330
Now we're going to have our paren,
and we're going to pass in an input.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.930
There's one parameter to rest_of_string,
so we need one input to pass in, and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.240
it should be a string.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.020
So I'll pass in the string, audacity.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.450
What happens when we call
a procedure like this?

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.940
Execution will jump into
the body of the procedure.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.780
So we can think of what the interpreter
is doing is, now instead of

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.600
running the code here, the interpreter
will move when we call a procedure.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.510
It will jump to run the code
inside the procedure.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.320
It will assign to the parameters,
the values passed in as the inputs.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.080
So we can think of this as
there being an assignment

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.140
that says now the value of s is the
value of this input that was passed in.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.640
And now we're going to evaluate
the body of the procedure.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.950
In this case, there's only one
statement, is this return statement.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.750
We're going to find this value,
so s[1:],

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.645
the result of that is going to
be the string, udacity.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.430
And then we got to the return.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.850
What return means is
we're going to jump back.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.180
We're jumping back to where
we called the procedure, but

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.390
now we actually have a result.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.660
So when we jump back the value that this

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.010
evaluates to is whatever
value we returned.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.670
In this case, it's the string udacity.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.560
So, we don't have our self-driving car,
but now you can define and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.660
use procedures.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.580
This is a really powerful concept.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.510
Anything that we're going to do
in the rest of the course, and

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.240
anything almost anyone does
in programming computers

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.540
is all about defining procedures and
using procedures.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.470
So now we should have a big smile.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.820
We can think of our procedures in
terms of mapping inputs to outputs.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.190
We can think of our humans as
also mapping inputs to outputs.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.370
We have inputs coming in through
the eyes, through the mouth,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.180
maybe we even have a nose.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.310
And, I won't try to draw any of
the outputs of our human procedure.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.125
But, since procedures are such
an important concept,

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:43.340
we're going to have several quizzes now,
to check that you understand them well.
