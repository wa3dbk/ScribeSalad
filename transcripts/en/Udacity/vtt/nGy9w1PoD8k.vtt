00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.360
When multiplying by a positive power of 10, the decimal point moves left, moves

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:08.505
right, or stays in place. Think about this as your decimal point. And just to

00:00:08.517 --> 00:00:12.685
note, 0 is actually not a positive power of 10. It's neither positive nor

00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:16.309
negative. You should look into that if you have questions about it.
