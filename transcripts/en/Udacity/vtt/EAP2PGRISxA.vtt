00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.800
We've talked about a few
different things so

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.320
far like market segmentation and
personas.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.920
And I know you're a startup, so
you just want to get to the bottom line.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.410
So where do you start?

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.530
What do you do first?

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.790
Well, let's talk to an expert.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.280
What does Moore have to say about this?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.180
&gt;&gt; As a startup, I think it's best
to start with persona and I think

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.360
the persona is the target customer
with a compelling reason to buy.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.600
And then I think as you start to
engage them with that persona.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.030
And so you put out your app or
you put out your downloadable thing, and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.770
you're hoping this
persona will download.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.720
Your communication,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.770
you use pictures that you hope
look like the person you want.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.150
And you say things you
hope they want to hear.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.050
And then you start seeing how
well they engage with you.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.170
And sometimes as you watch them engage,
you realize, I have the wrong persona.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.530
This thing is actually getting traction,
but

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.360
it's getting traction with
a different group of people.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.420
So you say okay,
well now maybe that's my persona, right?

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.090
So you have to be willing to move.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.680
I think when you start getting
quantitative around the discipline of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.070
segmentation is when you want to scale.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.802
When you start scaling and you start
saying, I'm going to actually make

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:09.997
significant marketing,
I'm going to raise capital somehow.

00:01:09.997 --> 00:01:12.540
And I'm going to spend
that money on marketing.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.490
Now you need to have a more

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.080
analytical approach to where
you're targeting that money.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.160
But the beginning I think
it's much more qualitative.
