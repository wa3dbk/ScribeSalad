00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's sort of cool that Top K via partitioning as just described works.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It gets us the Top K values in a not sorted order.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Right. Let's do an analysis of the time it takes for a Top K to do its work via this partitioning approach.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And because it's recursive algorithm, it's going to help to set this up in terms of recurrence relations.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Here's the recurrence relation we want to solve.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The time it takes to run Top K via partitioning on one element.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's call that 1, and the time that it takes to run an n element

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is going to be hard to write down exactly but we can put down a bound. So what does it do?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
First, it does the partitioning operation, which runs through all the elements of the list

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that takes time n and then it's going to recurse assuming it hasn't gotten really lucky

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and since this is a less than or equal to let's assume it didn't get lucky.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's going to recurse on either the left or the right.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, the partitioning algorithm is going to split this list L into a left and a right.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In different cases, it's going to recurse on either the left or the right.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But we don't know which one it's going to recurse on and we don't know which one is bigger.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What do we know? Well, it's just as likely for the left to be bigger

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
as it is for the right to be bigger and vice versa.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Really you can imagine with justification that with probability of half

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the left side is bigger and in particular bigger than size n/2

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and in half the cases right is bigger and again bigger meaning it's going to be at least size n/2.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If the recursive algorithm gets called on the smaller half

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
then the work that it has to do is whatever the recursive running time is on at least of size n/2

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
or smaller as this is an upper bound and that happens with the probability of half

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but we might also get unlucky and have to recurse on the larger half,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which could involve actually something almost the size of the entire list.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's kind of a weird recurrence relation because it has probabilities in it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but really we want a bound on the running time.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
How many steps it's going to take in this case on average for Top K to finish each stop.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I mean this gives us an upper bound. This recurrence relation gives us an upper bound.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
All right so to solve this recurrence relation, I'm going to cheat a little bit

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because I know that 4n is going to be a good upper bound on the value of T(n).

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
All we have to do is actually prove that that's true. We don't actually have to figure it out.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
To prove that this is true we're going to proceed by induction.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Our base case is T(1) = 1, which is indeed less than or equal to 4.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
For inductive step, we know from the structure of the algorithm

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that the time it takes to handle an input of size n is on average going to be

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
less than or equal to n+1/2T(n/2)+1/2T(n) just like we argued before.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And now we're going to use our inductive hypothesis that T(n) â‰¤ 4n

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to get an upper bound on this quantity.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
T(n/2) we're assuming is upper bounded by 4n/2, which is 2n,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and this quantity T(n) we're assuming is less than 4n.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Now this is a little bit of a mathematical abuse of induction.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We really don't want this to be n here because our inductive step is going to assume this

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
true for everything smaller than n and not equal to n

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but the reality is this is actually a tiny little bit less than n.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The worst possible case that you get in this algorithm is we pick the partition on the n,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and then we recurse on everything but the n.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There's t(n-1) here but it's--with apologies, you can make these

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
details all work out but it's a little irritating.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:49.000
With that caveat, we proceed. What we have is this is equal to n+n+2n, which is indeed 4n.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We've now shown that for each value of n, T(n) is always upper bounded by 4n.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And that's what we wanted to show, but this is pretty remarkable.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Because what that means is we actually find the Top K elements in Î˜(n).

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
You know 4n is Î˜(n) so the running time is going to be linear, which is pretty neat.
