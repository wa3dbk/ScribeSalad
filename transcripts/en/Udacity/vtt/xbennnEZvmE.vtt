We know that this line represents this equation. So this line shows all of the

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:08.823
pairs of x and y coordinates that satisfy this equation, make you see that the

00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:13.329
line is infinitely long, both in the negative and the positive directions. So

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.684
thinking about what the situation we're dealing with and trying to represent

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:22.320
with this equation actually is. Especially keeping in mind what x and y both

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.536
stand for in the story with Grant, maybe you think that our graph is perfect

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:30.984
just the way it is. You shouldn't change it. Maybe you think we should start at

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:35.336
x equals 0 and continue upward, or maybe you think we should start at y equals 0

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.519
and continue upward. Take your pick.
