00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is, of course, all of the above.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All of these would be good ways to test a GUI application

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because a GUI interface, similar to an operating system interface,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
usually represents a trust boundary.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And what I mean here is just the fact that it's usually the case

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that the GUI can't rely on a user to always present valid inputs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Therefore, a GUI application needs to be ready for basically anything.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And it turns out that when my children were younger,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
one of them was really good at crashing Windows machines.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You would just set him down at a Windows machine, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and he could make it unusable within a couple of minutes of just pounding on the keyboard.
