So what did all of that refactoring get us? Well, think about how you would

00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:06.406
implement this method now. Before, we had to create a local variable and

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.745
remember to increment it when we added a friend and decrement it when we took

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:14.664
away a friend. Implement getNumFriends, think about the ArrayList methods we

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:19.650
talked about that might help you. You can do this by adding one line.
