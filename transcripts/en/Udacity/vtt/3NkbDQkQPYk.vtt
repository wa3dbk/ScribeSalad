00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:04.890
Assuring privacy, and security and
trust is a necessity for digital patient

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.040
records and sharing these records
over a health information exchange.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.560
As a result, it's an ONC Standards and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.230
Interoperability Framework
workgroup priority area.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.040
We’ll be looking at many S&amp;I
workgroups as we proceed.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.370
So it's a good idea to first
look at how they operate.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.962
The process is intended to be grounded
in real-world issues, called use cases,

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:31.302
that are first identified
through an Environmental Scan.

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:35.582
And then molded into a consensus
document which drives

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:38.118
the development of standards.

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:42.480
Here's the workflow that surrounds the
use case of a provider ordering a lab

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.410
test, and the return of preliminary,
final, and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.900
then corrected results back
to the ordering provider.
