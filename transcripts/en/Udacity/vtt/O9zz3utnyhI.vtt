00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.926
One way to think about this problem is the inverse. Which of these processes

00:00:03.926 --> 00:00:08.620
normally is done by a programmable shader? The illumination model is evaluated

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.545
at the vertex or shader level. Similarly, the vertex shader performs model view

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:16.699
transforms as well as perspective, though not the perspective divide. The

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.980
Z-buffer is hardwired in. As this is a speed critical piece that is used by

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.410
most 3D applications. It's evaluated outside of the fragment shader. Image

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.270
post-processing, such as color correction and so on, is something that can be

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.326
done in the fragment shader. Typically by rendering a full screen quadrilateral

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:37.800
to drive the computations. Rasterization happens in between vertex and fragment

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.580
shading, so it's performed by dedicated hardware. It's what generates the

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.370
fragments for the fragment shader to process. Clipping is also hardwired and

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.651
happens just after the vertex shader and before rasterization itself. The

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.800
vertex shader outputs vertex locations and clipping space for this hardware to

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.860
process.
