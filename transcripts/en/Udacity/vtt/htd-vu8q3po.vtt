00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.590
Both are correct. These two are simply negatives of each other. If we go with

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.530
this direction, where by direction I mean the direction of this subtraction,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.394
we'll get a negative t statistic, because x bar for Wilma is greater than x bar

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:21.145
for Gettysburg. A negative of a negative is a positive. If we go in the

00:00:21.145 --> 00:00:25.996
opposite direction, we'll get the same thing only positive. Since we're doing a

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:30.600
two tailed test it doesn't matter if our t-statistic is positive or negative.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.711
As long as it's in the tail and in the critical region then we'll reject the

00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:34.860
null.
