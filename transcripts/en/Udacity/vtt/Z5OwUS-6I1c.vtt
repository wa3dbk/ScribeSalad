00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
For this problem, we're going to be implementing some pre-processing rules for SAT

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.650
and we're going to be using the same format to represent SAT as in the problem set for Unit 2.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.410
So if you have any questions about that, go ahead and read through this part

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.790
or go back and look at the problem set for Unit 2.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, what you're going to be doing is writing a function that when given Boolean formula

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.330
in the above format, we perform a few data reduction rules and I put the result in set of clauses.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.220
The goal for this is that we're going to give the actual SATs over a much, much smaller--

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.240
well, hopefully much smaller Boolean formula than it would ordinarily get

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.220
and hopefully, we can improve the performance of SAT in that way.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.310
Now, the data reduction rules we're going to be performing are these four here.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.880
First, if any clause consist of a single variable, we're going to set

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.650
that variable so that the clause is satisfied.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.170
So if the clause just consist of x2 for instance, then we'll set it to true,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.690
or is that the clause just consist of not-x2, we're going to set x2 to false,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.610
and that way, we know that x2 has to be that in order for the Boolean formula to be satisfied.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.880
The second one is that if a variable appears just once and it hasn't been set, then we set it

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.580
so that the respective clause is satisfied.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.140
The third rule is that we remove all clauses that have become satisfied.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.910
In that way, we just don't have to worry about them anymore in the upcoming SAT solver.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.300
The fourth final rule is that we remove all variables that evaluate to false--

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.500
so all variables x that are set to false and all variables not x where x is set to true for instance

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.140
that we know are set in that manner.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.760
Now, if this results in an empty clause, then well that means that the input formula

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.030
doesn't have any satisfying assignment for that variable, which means

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.280
that the Boolean formula itself isn't satisfiable.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.840
So then the function should return the Boolean formula 1, -1, and that is so that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.330
when we give it to a SAT solver, it will always result as unsatisfiable.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.480
Now, the difficult part is implementing rule 2 and rule 4--that's because your function

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.000
must perform these data reduction rules excessively until they can't be applied any further.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.070
So after you applied these rules, there might be other clauses for which these rules now apply

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.140
that they didn't apply to it before.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.120
Now, you have to be careful if a variable that now appears once has already been set earlier.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.990
If not, then rule 2 may apply, otherwise, it doesn't.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.580
Now, remember that during the course of this pre-processing, we can't change the satisfiability

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.780
of the overall formula or else the pre-processing rules aren't really helpful at all.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.350
If a SAT problem is satisfiable, the output of pre-processing also needs to be satisfiable.

00:02:51.350 --> 99:59:59.000
So go ahead and implement this function in the space given.
