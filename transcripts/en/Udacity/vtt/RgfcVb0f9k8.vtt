00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.936
I know that we have seen that there are two zeroes in this part of the graph,

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:07.445
but let's just pick one of them to focus us on. How about the right most one?

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:11.226
Which we knows in the interval 1 to 2. Now that we have chosen us here to focus

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:14.234
us on, we want to start narrowing down the interval that we knows the zero lies

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:18.700
between. In other words, we are going to start zooming in on this portion of

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.813
the graph. To do this, I'd like you to first pick a value of x that lies

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:26.829
between that interval, between 1 and 2. Type that here. And then, plug that

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.626
value of x into the function and write what f of x at your value is equal to.

00:00:31.626 --> 00:00:37.152
Now, remembering that the function is negative when x equals 1. But it's

00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:41.240
positive when x equals 2. Narrow down the interval in x in which the zero must

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.588
lie. So, the value of your function is negative, then the new interval will be

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:50.521
your x value and 2. But if the function is positive at your x value, then the

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:55.522
new interval will be between one and your value. Take a little time and think

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:56.993
carefully about this.
