00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Evans] For this quiz, which is an especially udacious one,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
your goal is to define a procedure, named measure_udacity,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that takes as its input a list of strings

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and outputs a number that is a count of the number of elements in the input list

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that start with the letter U, where U has to be upper case

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
since lower case Us are not quite udacious enough for us.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For example, if we evaluated measure_udacity passing in as input

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the list containing the strings Dave, Sebastian, and Katy,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the result would unfortunately be a 0

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
since none of those strings start with an upper case U.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
If we instead passed in the list containing the strings Umika and Umberto,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the result would be 2 since we have 2 strings that both start with the capital letter U.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
See if you can define the procedure measure_udacity.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I can't claim that this will be a really useful procedure,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but it will be a good test of whether you understand how to use a for-loop

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to go through the elements of a list.
