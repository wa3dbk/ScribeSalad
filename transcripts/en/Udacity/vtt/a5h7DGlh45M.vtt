Let's do one more quiz to practice simplifying terms. This time, please simplify

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.645
4x times y times negative 3x. Remember that this negative sign right here, in

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:17.471
front of the 3, is part of the factor negative 3. We're not subtracting 3x from

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:23.004
y. We're multiplying 4x times y by negative 3x. So, keeping that in mind, please

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:26.863
write the most simplified version of this term that you can over here.
