00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.700
You're probably asking yourselves,
if the event-driven model has

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.114
just one thread,
then how did it achieve concurrency?

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:09.700
In the multi-process and
the multi-threaded models,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.290
we had each execution context,
whether it's a process or

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.680
a thread,
handle only one request at a time.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.940
To achieve concurrency, we would simply
add multiple execution context, so

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.730
multiple processes or multiple threads.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.583
And then, if necessar,y if we
have fewer CPUs than contexts,

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:30.720
then we would have to
context-switch among them.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.240
The way the event-driven model achieves
concurrency is by interleaving

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.930
the processing of multiple requests,
within a same execution context.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.080
Here in the event-driven model,
we have a single thread, and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.220
the single thread switches its execution
among the processing that's required for

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.730
different requests.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.990
Let's say we have a client request
coming into the system, so

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.620
it's a request for client C1.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.170
And we receive a request for
a connection that gets dispatched,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.030
the accept operation gets processed.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.290
Then, we receive the actual request.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.590
So it's an HTTP message that gets
processed, the message gets parsed,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.720
we extract the files.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.700
So now we actually need
to read the file and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.530
we initiate I/O from
the reading file handler.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.340
So at that point, the request for
client one has been processed through

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.930
several of these steps and it's
waiting on the disk I/O to complete.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.430
Let's say, in the meantime,
two more requests have come in.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.830
So client two and client three have
sent a request for a connection.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.190
Let's say the client two
request was picked up first,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.720
the connection was accepted, and
now for the processing of client two,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.550
we need to wait for
the actual HTTP message to be received.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.330
So the processing of client
two is waiting on an event

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.930
from the network that will have the HTTP
message that needs to be received.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.930
And let's say client three,
its request has been accepted and

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.420
it's currently being handled,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.700
so the client three request is in
the accept connection handler.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.390
Some amount of time later,
the processing of

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.500
all of these three requests has
moved a little bit further along.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.260
So the request for C3,
the accept connection was completed,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.920
and now that request is waiting on
an event with the HTTP message.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.600
The request for client two, that one,
perhaps, we're waiting on the disk I/O,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.710
in order to read the file
that needs to be sent out.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.690
And maybe the request for client C1,
already started sending the file in

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.450
chunks at a time, so blocks of
some number of bytes at a time.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.900
So, it's waiting in one
of those iterations.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.440
So, although we have only one
execution context, only one thread,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.400
if we take a look, we have concurrent
execution of multiple client requests.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.070
It just happens to be interleaved, given
that there's one execution context.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.710
However, they're multiple,
at the same time,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.710
multiple client requests being handled.
