00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.860
Now, I'm not going to finish tracing
this sequence all the way through,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.120
but I think it would be a good idea for
you to do so.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.920
If it's worth studying Turing machines,
then it's worth getting your hands

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.680
dirty with the gory details,
at least a few times.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.340
So tell me what the 4th configuration
is, what the 7th configuration is, and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.650
what the 11th configuration is.
