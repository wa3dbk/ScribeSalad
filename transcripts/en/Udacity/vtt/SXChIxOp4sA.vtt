00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.708
Okay, here's a simple CUDA program that'll illustrate these ideas.

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.147
So we're going to launch 16 blocks,

00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:08.539
and each one's going to have a single thread running,

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.685
and it's going to run a trivial kernel that just prints, "Hello world! I'm a thread in block."

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.052
And then in the main, we're going to do nothing more than launch that kernel.

00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:18.665
You need this call cudaDeviceSynchronize to make sure

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:23.109
that these print f's flush and then we'll print, "That's all."

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.228
So before we run this, here's a quick quiz.

00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:29.199
How many different outputs do you think different runs of this program can produce?

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.031
Is it 1?

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.570
16 possible different outputs?

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.039
2 to the 16th possible different outputs?

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.184
Or 21 trillion possible outputs?
