00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The next thing you can do is you can co-locate.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Basically, this means buying space 
in a rack in a data center.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So, you still buy your own machines and 
you install them in this data center

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
or maybe you buy a whole rack or you buy a 
whole cage but basically a lot of websites do this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The biggest ones have their own data centers.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The biggest reason you do this is 
you have control over the machines.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You can build whatever machines you want, 
configure them however you want,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and wire them together however you want.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They're your machines, and you're renting the space.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Generally, you pay for things like rent to have your 
space, and then you pay for power and bandwidth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You pay for 30 amps or 60 amps to 
power a couple of machines in a rack,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
or you may pay for many more to 
have a whole cage of machines

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and you pay for how much bandwidth to use.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You maybe only need 10 megs a second 
or maybe you need 10 gigs.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.723
It all depends and you have control over all of this.

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:46.000
Downside is there's a high amount of work. You 
have to actually administer these machines.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You have to install software. 
You have to maintain them.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If they break, you have to replace them. 
It's a lot of effort.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So, if you're not good at sysadmining--system administration--doing all that sort of thing

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
colocation is a tough option.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you like doing that sort of thing, you can 
save some money by co-locating

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or if you're a big website with highly specialized 
needs, data centers are the way to go.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Few large websites don't control their own machines.
