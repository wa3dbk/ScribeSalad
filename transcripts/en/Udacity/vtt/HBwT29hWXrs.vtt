00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.270
So here's the answer. We'll try it and see what we

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.060
get. And while it's running, let's think about what we should

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.370
get. So we can look at the examples that we did

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.120
so far and try to make some predictions. So we saw

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.300
when the value passed in was 10 to the 5, that

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.960
the time it took to execute was 0.005. When the time

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.970
passed in was 10 to the 6, so 1 million. We

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.280
saw that the time to execute was 0.05, and now we're trying

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.970
to predict 10 to the nine. If we look at

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.130
the pattern here, every time we increase n by a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.590
factor of 10, the time also multiplies by a factor

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.624
of 10. And, that's not surprising because the loop is going

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:44.002
around ten more times. The times, number of times we

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.510
go through the loop, scales as a factor of the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.556
input value n, so if we increase n by a

00:00:48.556 --> 00:00:51.592
factor of 10, the time will also increase by a factor

00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:53.900
of 10. And we see we have got our

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.150
result now, so if we increase by another factor

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.820
of 10, we would expect that this would also

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.010
increase, that it would take about half a second to

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.310
do 10 million. If we increased by another factor

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.270
of 10 we would expect the running time would

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.280
also multiple by 10, so we'd be up to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.050
about 5 seconds. And if we increased by another factor

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.100
of 10 which is the billion that we tried, we'd

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.980
expect it to also increase by another factor of 10.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.190
Getting to be something around 50 seconds. So it's not

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.060
exactly a 1,000 times what we had when we did

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.770
spin loop passing in a million, but it's pretty close

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.260
to that. Now it's taking almost a minute, 1,000 times

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.000
this would be 54 seconds, so it's a little bit

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.120
off from that. But very close, and if we tried it

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.980
a few more times, we might get a slightly different result.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.710
Let's try is one more time. So we tried it again

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.140
and this time we got 55.89 seconds, pretty close to what

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.160
we got the previous time. The important point here is that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.890
the running time depends on the value of the input to

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.270
spin loop and it depends on in a linear way. As

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.730
we increase the magnitude of n, the higher number of times

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.919
through the loop, the running time scales linearly with that value.
