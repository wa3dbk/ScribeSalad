00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.920
We're going to look at a fun example. This is

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.648
me, and I'm going to India for Christmas holidays. And

00:00:06.648 --> 00:00:09.765
I'm going to make an airline reservation. I'm going to

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:13.140
use Expedia to make the airline reservation. So what I'm

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.320
doing on my computer, I'm sending a message to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.150
Expedia, saying, hey, make a reservation for me. And Expedia

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.630
chooses to make the reservation using Delta, so it sends

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.480
a message. a to b is a message that I

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.370
sent to Expedia saying I need a ticket to

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.660
go to India, preferences, and so on. Expedia then

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480
sends a message to Delta booking the reservation that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.040
I want. Delta confirms by this message, e to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.420
f, that yes, Kishore's reservation is in. And once

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.660
Expedia has received this confirmation from Delta, it sends

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.830
me a message, g to h. And this message

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.580
is telling me that I've go the airline reservation booked.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.120
So all of these are messages. a to b is

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.120
a message, a is the sending of the message, b is

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.770
the receipt of the message. And c is the sending

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.020
of the message from Expedia to Delta. e is the confirmation

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.220
that my reservation is in from Delta to Expedia and

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.530
finally g to h is the message from Expedia to me

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.540
saying that yes, you have your reservation, you can go to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.290
India in December. That's good. And then, what I'm doing is,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.950
I'm directly contacting Delta, message from me, me to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.200
Delta, asking for my preference for food. Fortunately, it's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.300
an international trip, so I'm going to get a

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.910
little bit more than peanuts on, on the Delta

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.680
flight to India. So I sent a message asking

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.440
for my meal preference and Delta confirms that yes,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.630
you have your meal preference. That's the message k

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.480
to l, is the message that confirms that I have

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.350
my meal preference, I'm all set. So everything

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.000
that I've described here is what you probably do

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.680
on a routine basis, every time you're making

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.210
any travel plans. Either contacting Expedia or some other

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.810
web portal to make your airline reservation. All

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.210
of this makes logical sense, right? There are several

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.900
beliefs that are ingrained in this picture here

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.310
about the ordering of events in the distributed system

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.940
that makes all of this work. In particular, when we look at the set of events

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.990
that you're seeing here as events that I'm

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.840
responsible for, we think that these events are happening

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.500
in sequential order. So for instance, if you

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.640
look at what Expedia is doing, it is receiving

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.700
my message saying that I want an airline

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.870
reservation to be made, does a bunch of bookkeeping.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.660
Then sends this message over to Delta saying that well,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.880
go ahead and make this booking for him, gets the acknowledgement

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.440
back from Delta. And then it does a bunch of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.860
other bookkeeping, once it gets the acknowledgement from from Delta and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.820
then it tells me that, okay, you've got it. And

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.230
after that, it does some more bookkeeping to say that, well,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.800
you know to show if booking is done and I'm

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.210
going to make some internal notes on the details of this booking.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.160
And so those are all things that are happening

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.380
as events within Expedia. So the beliefs that we have

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.690
is that processes are sequential, that is, the events

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.650
that we see happening in a given process, these are

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.640
the events that are happening in a given process,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.690
we expects these events to be totally ordered, right? So

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.720
for instance, you wouldn't expect given this ordering of

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.560
events, that you see in Expedia's profile that this event

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.750
m happened before sending this message c. Right?

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.410
So that's the mental model that you have,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.110
that events are totally ordered within a single

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.980
process, and that's why we're calling process sequential.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.330
That is, the execution of a process is a textual order that you see. At least

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.160
the apparent effect of the execution of the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.970
process that you, as a user, experience is sequential.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.810
So if I look at this particular process, h happens before i,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.270
f happens before g, and d happens before e, so all of these

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.740
are things that are ingrained in our mental model of processes being sequential.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.500
The other belief is that you cannot have a

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.510
receipt of a message before the send is complete, right?

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.960
So you have to send the message before it can

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.650
be received. In other words, the receipt of a message,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.910
which is b here, has to happen after

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.980
the messages are being sent from here. Similarly, this

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.400
message reception f must have happened after the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.840
message was sent from Delta. So those are the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.200
core beliefs that we have about what is

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.640
happening with events in a distributed system. That events

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.830
within the process are sequential. And across processes,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.090
when you have communication events, send happens before receive.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.090
So these are two core beliefs that we have about the working of

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.960
a distributed system. And we call

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.619
these beliefs, as they happened before, relationship.
