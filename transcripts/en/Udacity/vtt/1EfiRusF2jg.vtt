00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The one fact that allows to infer most, if not all other facts,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is the problem history.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
First of all the problem history is crucial to reproduce the bug.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If we repeat the steps, then we will hopefully find the same behavior

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in contrast to the expected behavior.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We may also be able to summarize what's going on

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and possibly even observe the state at the moment the failure occurred,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
getting more information such as a core dump

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or the currently active functions.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So, the problem history of all these facts is the most crucial

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the most important in a bug report.
