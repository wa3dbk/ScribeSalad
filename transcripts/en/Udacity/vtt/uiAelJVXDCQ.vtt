00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
And the correct answer, if you remember right from the last unit,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.790
is that we need to take some NP-complete problem

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.270
and show that we can use shortest tour to solve that problem,

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.440
so, this one up here is correct because, as I told you,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.210
a reduction basically means that we show that this NP-complete problem here,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.210
and we still have to choose a good one,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.300
kind of fits into shortest tour,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.800
so shortest tour is at least as hard to solve as this one up here.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.370
If it were the other way around,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.090
then you would just show that this NP-complete problem

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.840
is at least as hard to solve as shortest tour,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.920
but that doesn't give you any statement about shortest tour,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.020
so this is the way we need to do the reduction.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.590
Now, it says some NP-complete problem here,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.930
so the question of course is: Which one is it going to be?

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.110
Later in this unit, I'm going to show you a bunch of resources

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.920
that you can use to find suitable NP-complete problems to do your reduction,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.740
because when you have a very similar problem,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.570
and that's what you've seen with vertex cover and independent set,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.990
then the reduction becomes much easier to do.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.770
We saw with SAT and clique, for example,

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.730
that, if you have problems that are a bit different, then you might run into trouble.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.860
So, I'll give you those resources, but here's a general rule.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.520
If you don't find an NP-complete problem that is very similar

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.520
to the one where you're trying to prove that it is NP-complete,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.320
then usually it's a good idea to start with SAT because

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.660
SAT is in a way a very flexible and very universal NP-complete problem,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.690
so that's exactly what we're going to do here as well.

00:01:27.690 --> 99:59:59.000
We're going to try to reduce SAT to shortest tour.
