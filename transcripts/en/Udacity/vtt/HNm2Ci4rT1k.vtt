00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.469
Now that we looked different scheduling policies, let's discuss

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.939
the implementation issues of these scheduling policies in an operating

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.480
system. One possibility is, the operating system can maintain

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.570
a global queue of all the threads that are runnable

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.530
in the system. And, what these processes might do

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.890
is. When they're ready for work, they'll go to this

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.160
global queue and pick the next available thread from

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.310
this queue, and run that on itself. And the way

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.200
we organize the queues is orthogonal to the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.130
scheduling policy itself. But if the policy is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.830
something like FCFS, it makes sort of logical

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.740
sense to have. A global queue and let the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.040
processes pick from the queue the head of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.620
the queue is the earliest arriving thread and therefore

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.250
first come first serve policy we use this

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.760
global queue policy. This global queue becomes very infeasible

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.010
as an implementation vehicle. When the size of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.820
the multiprocessor is really big. Because then, it's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.570
a huge data structure that all these guys

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.850
have to access centrally and so on. So typically,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.150
what is done is to keep local queues

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.830
with every processor. And these local queues are

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.480
going to be based on affinity. And the particular

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.980
organization of the queues. In each of these processes.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.360
These local queues for each of these processes

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.540
is going to depend on the specific policy that you're

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.200
going to use. So, if it is last processor, or

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.090
is it, is it fixed processor, is it a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.960
minimum intervening, or is it minimum intervening plus queuing?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.220
All of those things will decide how these local

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.680
queues are going to be maintained. But important point I

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.220
want to get across is that. In implementing the scheduling

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.450
policies, you have to have a ready queue of threads

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.480
from which the processor will pick the next piece of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.130
work to do. And the organization of these queues will

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.430
be based on the specific scheduling policy that you might

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.060
choose to employ for the scheduler. And it might be

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.240
that processor p2 runs out of work completely, nothing in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.785
its local queue. In that case it might pull its

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:06.350
peers' queues in order to get some work from other

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.120
guys and run it in that processor. Now

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.300
that's something that might be done and that is

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.510
what is called work stealing in the scheduling

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.700
literature. So that might be something that is commonly

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.310
employed in a multiprocessor scheduler. So I mentioned

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.270
that the. Way these queues are organized is based

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.225
on policies that scheduler picks which might be

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:31.730
affinity-based or might be fairness based and so on.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.530
But in addition to the policy specific

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.340
attribute, it might also use additional information

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.000
in order to organize its queue In particular, a priority of a thread is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.430
determined by three components. Now one component

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.580
is the affinity component assuming it's an

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.760
affinity based scheduling policy. But in addition

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.820
to that, it might also use additional information.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.940
So for instance every thread may be born with a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.220
certain priority, so that is the base priority that. A

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.960
particular thread has when it is started up, and as

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.040
I mentioned, it might depend on whether you know they

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.910
usually give a huge amount of money you know, to

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.360
run this particular thread. So that is the base priority

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.270
that you associate with the thread, and, and, of course,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.920
then you take the affinity into a, into account. And in

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.640
addition to that, there is age coming in. And this

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.130
is sort of like a senior citizen discount. If a, if

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.870
a thread Ti has been in the system for a long,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.280
long time, you want to get it out of the system as

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.990
quickly as possible. So what you do is equivalent to giving

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.290
a senior citizen discount. You boost the priority of the thread

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.950
by At certain amount, so that it gets to, to be

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.140
at the head of the queue, and it will get scheduled

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.070
on the process of p2. So basically, the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.170
priority attribute is what determines the position in the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.900
queue in the particular thread. And as I said,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.050
three attributes that go with it is a base

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.190
priority that you may associate with a thread,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.440
then it is. First created, the affinity it has

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.180
for a particular processor, and also the senior citizen

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.450
discount that it might give to a particular thread

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.050
depending on how long it's been on the system.
