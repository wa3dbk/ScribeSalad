00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.233
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In the previous two lessons, we learned how to graph and write the equations

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.409
of a line. In this lesson, we'll learn how to graph a linear inequality. So,

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.963
instead of having an equal sign, we'll have a less than, greater than, less than

00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:17.262
or equal to, or greater than or equal to symbol. We'll learn how to do this by

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:22.302
saving money. Let's say you have $200 in a savings account and each month you

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:27.081
save exactly $100. What's an equation that you could write to model this

00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:32.262
situation? You can use this table to help you out. You can write your equation

00:00:32.262 --> 00:00:37.413
in here, and remember it should involve the variables x and the variables y. X

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:42.582
stands for the number of months, and y stands for the amount of money you saved.
