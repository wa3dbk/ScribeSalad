00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:05.032
So this time I would like you to consider the direct implications, again, of the other case.

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:11.899
So what if inverse halt, when run on inverse halt, does not halt? Does that mean that halt of inverse halt and inverse halt

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.499
is yes? Or does it mean that halt of inverse halt and inverse halt is no?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.400
And again, please just think about the direct implication for the moment here.
