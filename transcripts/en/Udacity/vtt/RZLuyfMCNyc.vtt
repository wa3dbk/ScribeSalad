00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What we want is a function called "test"

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which takes a string s--this would be the HTML input--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and if this HTML input s would cause Mozilla to crash, tests should return fail,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
otherwise, it should return pass.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're simply going to search whether s contains a select tag.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For this we set up a simple regular expression,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which says if there is a some substring in s

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which consists of an opening tag, select, and then an arbitrary number of characters

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which are not a closing tag--that is not a greater sign--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
this is expressed by this caret over here, meaning not the greater sign--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
not the greater sign and then star meaning 0 or more instances of that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and finally a closing tag.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So we can have a less than sign, select, then anything except for a greater than sign,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and finally a greater than sign.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is what makes an HTML tag.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If this occurs within our string, we return fail.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Otherwise, we return pass.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This regular expression requires a function from the RE module,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but we first need to import this.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, let's see what happens if we feed in a just a regular HTML tag

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
into the testing function.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What we get is pass, because there is no select tag in here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Let's expand this a bit, and now let's actually add a select tag in here

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as in this example.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now we see that our output changes to fail,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.369
because in here we actually do have a select tag.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.000
So this is what our testing function does.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It simply simulates the behavior of Mozilla.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Normally, we would pass this input to Mozilla and then see whether it crashes or not,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but in order to keep things simple, we're simply having this simple testing function,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.814
which checks directly for what is supposed to be in the input.
