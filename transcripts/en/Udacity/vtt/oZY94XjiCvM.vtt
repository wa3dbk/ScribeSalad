00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.730
Congratulations on finishing lesson three. Here we learned that it's important

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.790
to take a close look at the individual variables in your data

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.920
set. To understand the types of values they take on, what

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.600
their distributions look like, and whether there are missing values or outliers.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.960
&gt;&gt; We did all this in part by using histograms, box plots, and frequency

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.820
polygons, which are some of the most

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.140
basic and important tools for visualizing and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.700
understanding individual variables. We also made adjustments to these

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.420
plots. For example, we changed the limits on some

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.943
of our axes. We adjusted the bin width on

00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:40.820
our histograms. And we transformed variables either logarithmically or

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.530
turned them into binaries to uncover hidden patterns in

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.320
the data. These are some of the main conclusions

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250
that we had, and, maybe you have more. We

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.470
encourage you to share your ideas in the discussion

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.670
forum, and we'll see you again in lesson

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.120
four, where we explore the relationship between two variables.
