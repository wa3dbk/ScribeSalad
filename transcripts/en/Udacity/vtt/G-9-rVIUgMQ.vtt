00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
And luckily there's not many houses here, so a bit of playing around,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.070
I think you can get it.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.470
So first, you have to take this long road over here,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.210
because any other way to travel over here is

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.270
much longer and then you still need to go back,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.130
so with a bit of playing around, you can find out

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.040
you can find out that the next house to visit is this one here.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.470
Then it's almost obvious that you should go up here.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.250
Now here, you can choose to take the fast way to this house

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.220
up here or the one that takes a bit longer;

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.220
actually, it's better here to go down,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.790
because otherwise, you'll have to visit some of these houses multiple times.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.330
Then you can go back up here, and then you go over here,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.810
and then it's almost obvious, because you have to drive to base, anyway.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.090
That--this is the last one you have to visit,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.680
and then you go back to base, and the total time for this is,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.910
and I calculated this for you as a service,

00:00:46.910 --> 99:59:59.000
167 minutes.
