00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.440
My name is Vishal Makhijani.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.240
I'm the President and
Chief Operating Officer here at Udacity.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.330
I have one big job and that's to
help our folks help our students.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.910
I think what students always have to
remember is they have to be the best

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.060
salesperson possible for their idea.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.340
And what that means is being able
to crisply articulate exactly what

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.600
their idea is in a few short sentences.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.330
It's important not to get
too lost in the details.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.550
It's important to really understand
what your idea is about and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.050
be able to tell anyone who wants to know
exactly what your idea is all about.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.250
Like anything else that's important,
practice is really important.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.590
Try it out, try it out on your friends,
try it on your parents,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.790
try it out on your colleagues.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.370
Try it out on anyone that will listen,
in fact.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.180
Don't be worried about sounding foolish.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.360
Keep continue to work on that really
crisp pitch of what your idea

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.070
is all about with any and
all who will listen to it.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.870
Don't worry about giving that
idea away or any secrecy.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.400
The better you get at talking about
your idea in a way that excites and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.450
engages people,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.770
the better opportunity you have to build
that great thing that you want to build.
