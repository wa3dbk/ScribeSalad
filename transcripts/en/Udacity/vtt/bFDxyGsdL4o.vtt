00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.280
We've got two out of our three asynchronous requests working.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.060
Let's get some Wikipedia articles about the page to show up.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.230
We're on the MediaWiki API page, because Wikipedia is run by MediaWiki, and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.710
looking through this page, you'll actually find you don't need an API key.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.040
However, making normal JSON requests to Wikipedia would result in a cross origin

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.190
or a cross-site error, because Wikipedia servers forbid cross origin requests.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.080
There are several ways we can make this request to Wikipedia.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.490
One would be to set the origin and

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.850
content type headers on the request and then Wikipedia would allow it.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.190
Or, we can just use JSONP.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.970
In our example, we'll be using JSONP.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.660
A JSONP request is a somewhat convoluted trick

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.250
that involves a server wrapping the response inside a function to get

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.250
injected when it actually gets back to the client.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.820
But luckily, if this sounds confusing, don't worry.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.220
jQuery actually makes it pretty easy.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.200
To make a JSONP request, we'll use the more robust .ajax method.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.380
In fact, the .get JSON method we

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.530
were using before was actually just an abstraction of the .ajax method.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.560
Which is, incidentally,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.440
also an abstraction of an asynchronous JavaScript request.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.280
For this quiz, use the .ajax method to collect data from a Wikipedia endpoint.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.820
Let's take a look at the structure of the finished page.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.480
We start off with a Wikipedia container that has all the links and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.230
then inside of it we have this on sign list with an ID of Wikipedia links.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.880
Going through the on sign list, we see just a couple list elements, and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.980
then within each list element, we simply have an a tag with a link to Wikipedia.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.360
Each A-tag of course contains the title of the Wikipedia article within it.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.850
And like, you did before, for

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.000
this quiz you'll need to properly append the Wikipedia article to the page.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.430
You'll need to include a few parameters within your Ajax request.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.670
There will of course be a URL.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.410
You'll need to include a dataType.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.210
Notice, too,

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.070
in the signature we don't have an optional success function parameter.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.260
Instead, you'll have to set it as a property.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.370
Make sure your success parameter is set to a function that you want to

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.120
run when the request is returned successfully.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.650
To start off, you'll fire off a JSON-P request using $.ajax, and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.990
then into $.ajax.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.370
You'll pass a settings object that will include a parameter for

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.000
data type and a parameter for success.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.490
Once you get the response, iterate through it,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.320
and then present articles on the page.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.720
And, they should end up inside the unsigned list with the id of wikipedia-links.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.120
When you're done, check this box.
