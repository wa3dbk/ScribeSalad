00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, so here I have written out

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
3 JavaScript elements.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Number 1, a function definition of a function mymin,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
given 2 arguments a and b, if a is less than b we return a.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Otherwise we return b. We're returning whichever one is smaller.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Over here, another function definition for a function called "square."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It takes in a variable x and returns x times x.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And then over here, number 3, a statement.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're calling write, or if you prefer, document.write,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to display the result of calling mymin on the square of -2 and the square of 3.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In essence what we're trying to figure out is which is smaller,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
-2 squared or 3 squared?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And then we're going to print out that result.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
translate this to Python.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Submit via the interpreter.

00:00:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Write a Python program that does exactly the same as this JavaScript.
