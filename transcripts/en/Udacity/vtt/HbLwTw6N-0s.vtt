00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.420
So the answer is no. That it does not and the key reason why it does not is

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.690
there's no base case. Without a base case, it's

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.050
not a recursive definition. What it is, is a

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.610
circular definition. And that means that it actually doesn't

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.430
give us any answers. Because we'll never finish here

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.870
right. The only way that we've defined popularity whether

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.920
you look at that mathematical expression or the python code.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.130
Always involves calling popularity again. And we are never going

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.830
to get to a point where we can stop. That we

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.000
are going to keep calling popularity for different people. If

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.800
we think of doing this for our friend graph, well here's

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.980
what would happen. If we wanted to know the popularity

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.570
of Charlie. Well, we have to look at all the people

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.000
who are friends with Charlie. So, that means that the popularity

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.070
of Diana, the popularity of Edgar, and the popularity of Fred.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.310
But, for each of those, we need to compute their

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.220
popularities. To the popularity of Diana, that's going to be

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.240
equal to the popularity of Alice. So, now we're here,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.260
but we need keep going. And, the popularity of Alice

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.480
is the popularity of Edgar plus the popularity of Bob.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.050
But we need to keep going. We still need

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.780
the popularity of Edgar well, that's the popularity of Fred.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.140
And we need the popularity of Bob, which is the popularity

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.610
of Fred. And we need the popularity of Fred, which

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.850
is the popularity of Charlie, plus the popularity of Bob.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.910
So, this is not okay, right? The problem is, we

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.650
started trying to figure out the popularity of Charlie, we did

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.090
all this work following these links backward. And now, to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.720
solve it, we need to know the popularity of Charlie.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.980
But that's what we were trying to solve. So

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.420
this is not a recursive definition. To be a good recursive

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.040
definition, we have to end up with a simpler version of the problem. And never

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.410
go back to the one that we started with. The way we've defined it, we get

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.600
back to the one that we started with.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.720
We haven't made any progress. We're never going to

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.370
get an answer. Charlie will be very unhappy

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.050
because we'll never know how popular he is.
