00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.469
Alright so here's what we're going to do. We're going to try to figure

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.280
out how to draw sorry, compute XOR as instead of a single

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.740
perceptron, which we know is impossible, we can do it as a

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.050
network of perceptron. Just to, to make it easier for you, here's

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.300
how we're going to set it up. That we're, we've x1 and x2

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.540
as our inputs We've got two units. This first unit is just

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.330
going to compute and add and we already know how to do that.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.160
We've already figured out what weights need to be, here and here.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.710
And what the threshold needs to be, so that the output will be

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.970
the and of those two inputs. So, that's all good. But ,what we don't

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.310
know ,eh, what, what, it turns out to be the case, that the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.430
second unit, with now three inputs, X1, X2, and the and of X1 and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.510
X2, can also be made to, or can be, can be, now, we

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.780
can set the weights on that, so that the output is going to be

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.210
X or. So, what we'd like you to do is, figure out how to

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.050
do that. How do you set this weight - Is the input of X1,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.350
this way which is the and input, and this way which

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.488
is the X2 input, and the threshold. So that ,it's going to actually

00:00:58.488 --> 00:01:00.710
compute an X or. And, and just so you know, this

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.790
is not a trick question. You really can do it this time.
