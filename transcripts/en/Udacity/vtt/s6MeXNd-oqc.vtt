00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.860
And the answer is that these two equations, y equals 5x and y equals 12 minus

00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:09.320
3x, are the only two equations for which the slope can be found from the

00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:14.085
coefficient of the term with an x to the first power in it. The equations here

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:19.035
which don't just make straight lines when we graph them, which, as we'll learn

00:00:19.047 --> 00:00:24.016
later on in the course, are those that have factors of x combined with other

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:29.262
things besides constants. So, those would include this first equation, this very

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:34.245
long, not very nice equation, this one and this one definitely don't have this

00:00:34.257 --> 00:00:39.328
property. In fact right now, we have no idea how to talk about the slope of line

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.951
that isn't just a straight line. If we have some sort of funky curve, how can we

00:00:43.963 --> 00:00:47.484
talk about the direction that it's pointing? It's pointing in different

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:51.304
directions at all these different points. So, we can rule all of those answers

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:55.152
phases out. We'll talk more about the slopes of these four remaining equations

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:55.941
in just a second.
