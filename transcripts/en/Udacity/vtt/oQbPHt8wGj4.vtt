00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
And, of course, this is not difficult to check.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.060
So the first program, definitely that will stop.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.960
It will print out the 3 words and the length of that word, and then it's done.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.720
Second 1? Yes. That goes into an infinite loop, because x starts out as -2,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.740
and while x &lt; -2, it will decrease x.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.460
Now, you might have been a bit nitpicky here by saying,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.630
"Well, there was a certain limit on how large or small variables can get."

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.190
Let's assume here that we're working with an integer structure that can get

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.180
as small as we need it to be, and just uses up more memory in that case,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.900
and, in that case, this program here will indeed go into an infinite loop.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.890
And now for this 1 here it's very easy to see that it terminates.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.880
It just adds 1 to the -100 here, and then it's done.

00:00:44.880 --> 99:59:59.000
So definitely yes. This program will stop.
