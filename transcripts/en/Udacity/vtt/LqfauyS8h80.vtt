00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.860
In this case, I think about the spiral model,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.610
and evolutionary prototyping model will work. Definitely you don't want to

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.110
have a pure water from water. Why? Well because it

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.940
is very expensive with a pure waterfall model to make

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.460
changes during the course of the project, especially changes

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.860
that involve requirements. Why? Because we saw that it can

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.440
be very expensive. Whereas with the spiral model, we saw

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.220
that being iterative, we can actually make correction throughout development.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.840
Similarly, with evolutionary prototyping, we keep evolving our system

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.170
based on the customer feedback. And therefore, if something changes,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.810
we will get feedback right away, and we will

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.230
be able to adapt. So the key thing here is

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.060
that anything that is iterative works better in the

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.400
case of changing environments. So, situations in which your requirements,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.720
the situation, the project might change. Whereas waterfall is

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.410
more appropriate for situations in which the requirements are stable,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.760
we know the domain, and possibly we also know the technologies involved.
