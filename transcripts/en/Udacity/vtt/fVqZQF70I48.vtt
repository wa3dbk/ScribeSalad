00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is no.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you look at the first data point and divide the price by size,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you get approximately 31.1765.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Compare this to the next data point, which gets you 30.9524.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They're about the same but not quite.

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In fact, they're all different for the different data points, as you can see over here.
