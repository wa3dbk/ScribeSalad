00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.521
a times the nth root of b is written in simplest radical form, as long as b

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:09.381
doesn't have any factors that can be written as powers greater than or equal to

00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:14.065
n, the number that tells us what kind of root this is. The reason for this is,

00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:19.234
if we have something like the 4th root of 7 to the 6 power, we can rewrite that

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:24.248
as the 4th root of 7 to the 4th times 7 to the 2nd. This first factor will just

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.361
reduce as a result of the radical to be 7 on its own, and all that will be left

00:00:29.373 --> 00:00:34.597
under the radical sign, or rather the 4th root sign will be 7 squared. And of

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.598
course, we can also rewrite this as 7 times the 4th root of 49.
