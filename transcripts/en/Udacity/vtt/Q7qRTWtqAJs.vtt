00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.966
So for the next quiz, I've changed the Boolean formula here a bit.

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:07.466
And you'll notice that none of the pre-processing rules that we had in the previous quiz apply now.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:13.666
So there's no clause here with just a single variable, so that rule doesn't apply. And also, each variable appears at least once.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:23.866
So, x1 appears 1-2-3-4 times. X2, 1-2-3 times. And so on. So each variable appears at least twice.

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:29.399
And also, the other pre-processing rule doesn't apply because each variable here appears more than once.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.232
So x1 for example appears four times. It appears here, here, here and here.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.999
And the same thing for all the other variables. So they all appear at least twice.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.332
So we can't use the rule that we just devised if a variable appears just once.

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:48.799
Nevertheless, so if you look at x1, x2, x3 and x4, we're again going to ignore x5 here.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.466
Then I think it's still possible to kind of easily see for one of those variables here, if that should be set to true or false.

00:00:55.467 --> 00:01:00.332
Of course, this is a bit harder than the previous question, but I think you can nevertheless figure it out if you look closely

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.000
at those four variables here.
