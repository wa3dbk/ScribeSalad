On the other hand, our vision still has a lot of developing to do after we're

00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:07.768
born. A newborn can only see at about 20-600, which isn't great at all

00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:12.759
considering that 20-20 is perfect vision. Objects need to be really close to a

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.615
baby for them to be able to see it. It's not until at about age three or four

00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:22.298
when vision is similar to that of an adult. An interesting point to make is

00:00:22.298 --> 00:00:25.902
that newborns aren't great at seeing color. Our eyes have to develop in order

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:30.086
for us to see color. Remember the rods and the cones in the eye? Our cones need

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:34.810
to develop and merge to the center of the retina for us to see color in detail.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.982
When we were born, we primarily use our rods, which allow us to see black or

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:41.972
white or light and dark. This is why babies are so fascinated with high

00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:46.686
contrast black and white designs. And when we get older, we use our rods and

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:47.939
our cones.
