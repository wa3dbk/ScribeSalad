00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I want to ask a few questions about this protocol to see that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
you can understand some of the things that could go wrong

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with this simplified version of TLS.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here are some possibilities and keep in mind the threat model that we introduced earlier.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We're assuming an active attacker with limited computational power.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Check all the things that we should be worried about going wrong

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the way the protocol is specified here.
