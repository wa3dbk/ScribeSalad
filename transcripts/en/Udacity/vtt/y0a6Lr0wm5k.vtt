00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now that's really cool which means for any coin flip in any sample size,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
you can compute for me how confident you are.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If in the coin flip, you came back to saying, wow I believe it's the 0.44,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you can now say, well, given the number of same as the head, it's not 0.44. It's a confidence interval.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's a certain way of maybe ±0.07 that gets added to the 0.44

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that they can be confident about according to our method study so far.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In practice, in which you were given a sample and you don't know the exact value of p.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Suppose this is the sample you observed, N=4 and we're going to apply the formula

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
even though we understand it should only apply when N is equal or larger than 30.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Just for the exercise of applying the formula, compute for me the mean and the variance.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The variance, I don't need the formula variance but the variance,

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I mean the actual variance from the data sequence.
