00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.812
So we said this works for any right triangle. We can square the leg, square

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:08.463
another leg, and add those together to get the hypotenuse squared. But, why

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:13.746
does this work? Well, let's see this by starting off with a square. Here's one

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:17.522
large square, and then this small square has a side length of a, and this

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:22.966
larger square has a side length of b. So, we know that the area of this square

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:28.912
is a squared. And the area of this square is b squared. And now, what I'm

00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:33.314
going to do is break this white space up into four congruent rectangles. If

00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:37.575
this length is a, then we know that this length is also a. And we know if this

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:43.040
length is b, then this length is also b. If our entire shape is a square, then

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.650
we know that if this side is a plus b, then this side must also be a plus b.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.456
That's how we know that this side length is b. We can use the same reasoning to

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:59.861
say that this side length here, is a. Since we know the entire side must be a

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:04.959
plus b. So, notice that all four of these triangles are identical. They all

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:10.105
have a leg of a, a leg of b, and a hypotenuse of c. The four triangles are just

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:14.950
oriented in different ways. Like for this one, here's a, here's b, and here's

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.506
they hypotenuse across the 90 degree angle c. So now what we're going to do is

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:26.267
take this triangle and fix it at this point. We're going to rotate the triangle

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:30.206
around this point. We're also going to take this triangle here and fix it at

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:35.687
this point. So we can rotate the triangle around this point. So let's move

00:01:35.687 --> 00:01:40.619
these two triangles to a different position. We're going to swing this triangle

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.985
up, around this point, and we're going to swing this triangle down, around this

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:50.442
point. When we rearrange the triangles, we get this new arrangement. Notice

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:54.906
that I have the same four triangles, with legs a and b, and a hypotenuse of c,

00:01:54.906 --> 00:02:01.450
and the area inside here is c squared. So, what do we know must be true about

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.295
this area and this new area? Take some time to think and then fill in the

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:11.342
missing statements to this sentence. Choose one of these statements to make

00:02:11.342 --> 00:02:15.169
this sentence true. And then, check any of these boxes that provide the correct

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.270
reasoning.
