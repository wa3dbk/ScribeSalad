00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.200
I've always said that the fun part of

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.770
any systems research is the technical details and implementing

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.440
an idea. So let's look at some of

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.170
the implementation details here. So what's going to happen is

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.930
that when a process or a thread on a processor Tries to write to a page X.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.770
At the point of writing to that page X,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.520
the operating system is going to say this guy wants

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.630
to write to this X, I'm going to make a twin for this page, so there's the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.729
original page, and then the twin for the

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.030
same page, and the original page is writeable by

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.870
this process. That mapping is there in the

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.240
page table. This new copy, a twin, has been

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.030
created in physical memory. It's not mapped into the

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.940
page table of any process. It is just additional

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.110
copy of the same page created by the operating system as a twin. So this page

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.170
has been made writable and therefore the thread

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.840
can make changes to the X, which is the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.860
original copy of the page. So the thread reaches the release point.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.550
So when the thread reaches the release point, what the DSM software is going to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.110
do, is compute the depth between the changes

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.430
that have been made, and the original

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.180
version. The original version, we created a twin,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.210
right? So this is the twin, and this is the original page, but this original

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.210
page we made modifications to. X has now become x prime, and this is the twin,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.332
which is containing the page as it was before The thread started writing to it.

00:01:41.332 --> 00:01:44.190
So the DSM software at the release point, is

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.020
going to compute the diff between the original copy of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.310
the page, and the modified copy of the page.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.800
And the diff is going to be computed as a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.150
run link encoded diff. Meaning that all of the

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.840
Page is not been modified. It's only this portion

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.120
and this portion of the page that have been

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.650
modified. So the diff is going to be computed as

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.919
oh, the page is changed starting from here

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.060
up until here and starting from here up until

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.420
here. This is the starting point for the change

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.370
and this is the amount of change and this

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.040
is the content of the change. The diff in

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.510
the data structure that had been created by the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.890
DSM software to remember the changes that had been

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
made to this data x prior to release as

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.558
you may have imagined already when the same block That governs

00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:44.160
[UNKNOWN] to this page which was released over here is acquired by a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.510
different processor at the point of acquisition. What we're going to do is we're

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.900
going to invalidate all the pages that were touched In this critical section,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.080
including x. So, x will be invalidated at

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.460
the point of acquisition of the same lock

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.540
that is governing this critical section. And when

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.200
that processor has a page fault for page

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.820
x. A DSM software knows that, oh, there is a Diff lying around on this node

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.400
which is needed in order to update the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.000
page and give it to the current lock acquirer.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.080
So, that's part of what goes on under

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.670
the covers in the implementation. But so far

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.780
as this node is concerned When the release

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.440
operation is done, at that point, the DSM

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.260
software is going to compute the diff between

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.890
changes made to this page and its original

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.510
copy of the page and keep that as

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.310
a diff data structure. And there are multiple pages,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.980
all of the diffs will be created. At the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.880
point of release. And once this thread that was in

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.080
this critical section has completed its release operation, we will

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.920
write protect this page X. We're write protecting it to

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.290
indicate that this guy cannot write to it anymore

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.130
unless he gets in the critical section and we have

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.320
to do the coherence actions again. And that's the implementation

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.400
of the protocol. And at this point we write-protect the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.740
original page and we can also get rid of

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.779
the twin. The use for this twin is complete. We

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.310
only needed it in order to compute this dift.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.500
We've computed it and we write-protected the original page and

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.720
everything that needs to be done on this node

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.620
is complete and we can get rid of this twin

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.390
and getting rid of this twin essentially means That

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.890
we are freeing up the physical memory that we allocated

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.950
for creating the twin in the first place.
