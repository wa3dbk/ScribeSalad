00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.750
The answer is, you can't construct an interface type. We know this can't be the

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.404
answer because we have assigned objects of certain classes to variables of

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:13.092
interface types. In the example before this, you saw code that created new dogs

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:16.212
and then put them in drawable variable or added them to lists of drawable

00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:22.358
items. So this statement is false. This statement is true, but doesn't apply in

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:27.942
this case. I can only put an object into a variable with an interface type if

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:33.602
the object is of a class that implements the interface. Like in this case. But

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:38.486
if the dog class didn't implement the drawable interface, I wouldn't be able to

00:00:38.486 --> 00:00:43.070
do this. If you're not quite sure why you can't construct an interface type,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.330
let's look at the code. This is the code for a dog. It has all of the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.412
information on how to move and how to draw. The drawable interface has almost

00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:55.160
no information at all. If you tried to make a new drawable, it would know that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.339
it should know how to draw. But wouldn't know how to draw. That's why Java

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.527
won't let you construct a drawable.
