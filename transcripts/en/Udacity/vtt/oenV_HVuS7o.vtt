00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
So 2^n, if instances are smaller than 10 that means that the running time will be

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.200
around 1000 time units or 1024 time units to be precise.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.370
If it's 20, you will have about 1 million time units.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.670
If it's 30, you will have about 1 billion time units. So 1 thousand times 1 thousand times 1 thousand.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.390
If it's larger than 100, then of course you have a huge running time here.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.230
You will have a running time that is about 10³⁰.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.600
It's clear that when your instances get larger than 100, you would not be able to use brute force.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.830
And on the other hand, if you just need 1000 time units, I think you don't even care if you have

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.960
1 instance or 100 or 10,000 because if you think about it a current desktop computer

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.630
is running on gigahertz so it can perform several billion operations per second.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.000
Even solving 10,000 instances where each one is small is usually not an issue unless

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.170
you're working in a very special environment.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.940
What about a million time units? I would clearly say well solving that once is okay.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.790
Again, your computer can perform several billion operations per second.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.280
Solving 100 instances is usually okay and even solving 10,000 instances.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.870
So 10,000 times 1 million that's 10 billion, which sounds like a lot but actually again

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.660
desktop computers can handle this in most cases.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.480
Now what about this case here? Well, 1 billion is okay. We just said that over here.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.830
And we said even 10 billion was okay. So what about 100 billion?

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.840
Well, this I think here is kind of debatable but I would still say it's worth a try probably.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.990
Then you have to probably wait for two or three or four days until all instances are solved

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.190
or maybe even one month but in most cases that should be okay.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.340
You wouldn't even attempt to solve NP-commplete problem in real time for example.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.360
This one here I think is the most debatable.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.190
So 10,000 billion I would say in a general case you wouldn't want to do that.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.950
I mean, there might be special cases if you work for the secret service

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.440
and you have a huge cluster of computers available but here you're kind of

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.400
reaching the limits of brute force and here of course as we just said you've already reached that.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.250
So again, brute force can work if the instances are small or maybe even moderate

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.660
but this approach is bound to fail at some point and that's when to apply intelligence

00:02:19.660 --> 99:59:59.000
instead of brute force using intelligent force.
