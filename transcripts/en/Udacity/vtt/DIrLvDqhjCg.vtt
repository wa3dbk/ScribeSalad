00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.380
Now that we have an extra column, our variable and

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.520
our data frame, we can create a histogram of it.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.070
This histogram reveals that most households buy one or two

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.930
yogurts at a time. To dive deeper into our yogurt

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.800
prices and household behavior. Let's investigate the price over time

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.680
in more detail. This is where our Facebook data was

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.840
deficient. In this data set, we can examine changes in

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.730
prices because we have data on the same households over time.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.440
So, now I want you to use your

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.260
knowledge of scatter plots and over-plotting to create

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.592
an appropriate visualization. Your visualization should be a

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:37.310
scatter plot of price versus time. Now, there's no

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.280
right answer here, so just create a plot

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.200
that's sensible and that allows you to see the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.450
data. You can assess your code and your

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.820
plot with what we did in the solution video.
