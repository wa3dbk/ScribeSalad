00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.803
So, what we saw in this last quiz was
really interesting. Remember that we

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:08.786
started out with 3^2 times 3^4, and we ended up
with 3^6 power.

00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:13.693
What we need to notice here is how the
exponents are related to each other. 2+4,

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:19.169
our two original exponents, is equal to 6,
the final exponent. So, this actually

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.519
shows us a general rule for multiplying
factors that have exponents. If the two

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:28.191
numbers are multiplying together have the
same base, then their exponents just add

00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:31.926
to one another, and the base stays the
same. So, let's write that in a more

00:00:31.926 --> 00:00:36.651
general way. If we have some number, or
variable a, and it's taken to the power of

00:00:36.663 --> 00:00:41.331
b, and that's multiplied by another number
a that's taken to the power c. Then

00:00:41.338 --> 00:00:46.318
together, that multiplication can be
written as a^b+c.

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:56.188
So, like we saw in the last quiz,
3^2 times 3^4=3^2+4=3^6, just like we found out

00:00:56.188 --> 00:01:00.316
in the end. Since exponents indicate
repeated multiplication, since each of

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:05.230
these factors right here is just the
number or variable a being multiplied by

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.400
itself over and over again some number of
times. When they are multiplied together,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.075
it's just even more a's multiplied
together, or some different number of a's

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:16.893
multiplied together. This is just a
convenient way for us to not have to write

00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:20.346
out all of the numbers like we did when we
were doing this last quiz.
