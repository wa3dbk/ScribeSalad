00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.800
So now you've learned
the basics of database design,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.230
building normalized tables to represent
various relationships amongst data.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.360
And you spent some time
at the PostgreSQL and

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.650
Python DB API documentation.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.110
So you're prepared to refer to
them in your future database work.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.070
In the next lesson, you'll bring
together all those skills to

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.800
build a database backed tool
to solve a particular problem.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.020
Running a game tournament
that's both fair and

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.610
challenging for all its players.
