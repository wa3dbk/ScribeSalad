00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.368
These should have given 42, 16 and 4. This last one should have surprised you

00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:10.443
if you haven't coded before. Mostly Java follows the same rules that you learn

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:19.392
in algebra. Here x is 3 and y is 4. Multiplication happens before addition and

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:26.400
then we add 4 to 3 and get 7. 2 and 4 gives us 6 and we multiply it to get 42.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.136
It's possible that your algebra sense took over here and you read xy as x times

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:39.320
y. But it should actually be 11 because xy is a variable. Then y over 2 and 3,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.287
3 and 2 and 11 gives us 16. For this last one it kind of looks like Java just

00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:54.550
miscalculated. I would've expected this to be 4 plus 5, which is 9 over 2.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.650
Which would be 4.5. Let's go back to Cay

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.810
to talk about what happened.
