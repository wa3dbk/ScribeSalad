00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.072
Let's say we have a compound inequality x is less than 3 or x is greater than 7.

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:07.836
How do you show this on a number line? Please fill in what parenthesis or

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:11.994
brackets you think belong in either of these two light blue boxes. And then also

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:15.854
check off which of these three regions you think should be shaded in. I'll

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:19.949
assume that if you shade in either of these two regions on the ends, you'll want

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.226
the shading to extend forever in this direction or in this direction. Depending

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:28.783
on which end you shade. If you shade in the middle however, I'll assume it's

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:30.076
only between 3 and 7.
