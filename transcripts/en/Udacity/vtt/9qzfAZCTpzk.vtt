Here are a few examples where
ads are used fairly effectively.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.340
You could see here a banner ad.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.200
Banner ad are images based
advertisements that often appear

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.120
in the side, top, or
bottom section of a website.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.790
They use PCC, paper click model,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.630
In which advertisers pay a fee each
time a user clicks on this ad.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.410
You can see here on the verge,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.740
that Spotify is actually taking quite
a lot of real estate over the top.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.490
If we scroll down,
we can see another ad over here.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.670
And in most cases,
if we continue scrolling,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.530
down to the bottom we can see
another ad just over here.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.200
Another example would be the Huffington
Post, and you can see here another ad.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.230
And another example in Yahoo Finance
would be actually two ads one for

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.680
their mobile app and the other very
prominently on the right side.
