00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.840
The first point we need to consider is for

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.850
store instructions, when does the memory write actually happen?

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.980
And it happens at commit. We have to do

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.510
writes to memory at commit because it is unsafe

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.090
to update memory at any point before the instruction

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.910
commits. Any instruction that has not yet committed is

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.242
subject to being canceled. For example, because of a

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:25.440
branch misprediction or exception. So doing a memory write prematurely

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.024
might mean that later we have to undo access to

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:30.676
memory, meaning we have to kind of put back the

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:34.076
old value of a memory location which is extremely difficult

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:37.770
to do. So what we will do is we will delay

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.220
memory writes and restores untill commit. But does it mean

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.570
that the load has to also wait until commit before it

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.700
can get data, because only then the data is in

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.600
memory? So the question is, if we write values on stores

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.190
at commit, where does the load get data? And

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.250
we want our loads to get data as early

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.920
as possible, so that we can finish those loads

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.370
and supply that data to the subsequent instructions that

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.090
depend on the load. For this purpose, we introduce

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.070
a structure called load-store queue. And that is where

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.350
we will keep all loads and stores, and we

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.320
will next see how loads get data from the stores.
