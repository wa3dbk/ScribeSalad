00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.848
One more practice finding the vertex of a parabola from its equation. Where is

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:09.815
the vertex of y equals the quantity x minus 7 squared plus 5? Think about the

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:14.423
form that this equation is in right now, and think about what it needs to be in,

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:16.392
in order for us to find a vertex.
