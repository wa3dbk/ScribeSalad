00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.318
If you save 2 5ths of any money you earn in a month, what fraction can you

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:07.052
spend? And I am going to draw a circle to help you out. This circle is going to

00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:10.636
represent the total amount of money that you've earned and you can enter your

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:14.252
answer in this box here. Put the numerator on top and the denominator at the

00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:14.653
bottom.
