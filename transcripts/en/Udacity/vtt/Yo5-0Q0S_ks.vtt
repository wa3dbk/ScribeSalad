00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.754
All the testing levels that we've seen so far is what

00:00:02.754 --> 00:00:06.058
we can call developer's testing. So that's testing that is performed

00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:09.649
either within the testing organization, or by somebody who's doing like

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:13.520
third-party testers on behalf of the testing organization. But there are two

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.280
other kinds of testing that are worth mentioning that are also

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.600
related to testing phases and these are alpha and beta testing.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.050
Alpha testing is the testing performed by distributing a software system

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.000
ready to be released to a set of users that are internal

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.480
to the organization that developed the software. So you can consider these

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.460
users as, if you pass me the term, guinea pigs that will

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.170
use an early version of the code and will likely discover errors

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.850
that escaped testing and will have made it to the field if

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.390
not caught. Beta testing is the next step after alpha testing, in

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.530
which the software is released to a selected subset of users, in

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.770
this case, outside your organization. And also in this case, the users

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.110
are likely to discover latent errors in the code before it is officially

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.240
released to the broader user population, so before we have an

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.850
actual product release. So you may wonder why do we need

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360
to do both alpha and beta testing. Why not just one

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.980
of the two? The reason is that alpha testing is performed

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.730
to iron out the very obvious issues that still escape testing,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.610
but we want to do that before involving people outside your

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.730
organization. And the rationale is that alpha testers have a higher

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.710
tolerance for problems than beta testers, who expect a mostly working system.
