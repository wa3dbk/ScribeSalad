00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's start out by looking at a scale and some weights. A scale can determine if

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:07.750
the weights on the left side and the right side are equal, or if one side is

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:11.695
heavier than the other. I've added some weights to the scale. The left side of

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:15.800
the scale has a total of 8 pounds. The right side of the scale also has a total

00:00:15.812 --> 00:00:20.050
of 8 pounds. We can write an equation that represents the weight of these scales

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:25.433
on each side. I have 6 pounds and 2 pounds is equal to 5 pounds and 3 pounds. We

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:30.260
know they both make 8. Now, let's do something crazy. Let's add a ton of weight

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:34.870
to both sides, like 100 pounds. Think about what'd happen to the scale, and try

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:39.455
and answer this question. If 100 pounds of weight is added to both sides, which

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:45.320
side weighs the most? The left, the right, or they weigh the same.
