00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.130
So let's discuss the memory ordering quiz solution for

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.214
this. In this situation there is a store and

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:08.582
then a load to the same address, so the

00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:11.542
load obviously doesn't go to cache or memory to

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:13.750
get its value. It's going to get it from the

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.720
store. But where does the store keep its value?

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.050
The store doesn't broadcast the result. The result is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.330
broadcast for instructions that produce register result. So the store

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.360
really never broadcasts its results. So this

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.619
is definitely not true. A reservation station, reservation

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.620
stations never provide any results to subsequent instructions.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.760
They only keep values captured for the current

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.540
instruction. The store doesn't even have a reservation

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.761
station. So this is definitely not correct. A

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.749
ROB entry would keep a result for a

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.370
register producing instruction between the time it's been

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.890
broadcast and the time it commits. But because

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.368
a store is not a register value producing instruction,

00:00:57.368 --> 00:00:59.440
it doesn't put its result in a ROB

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.066
entry, in fact, technically, the store doesn't have a

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:07.530
result. So this is not correct. The store

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530
does keep the values going to store in the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.240
low store Q, and if you remember, that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.640
is where the load searches for a value when

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.910
it's trying to match its address to addresses of

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.830
previous stores. So this is the only correct answer.
