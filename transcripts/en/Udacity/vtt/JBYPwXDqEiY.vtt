00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.430
And as you can see, each time we add 10 to n, so 10+10=20+10=30+10=40,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.600
the probability of reaching a success decreases by well more or less with a factor of 10 if not more.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.450
So this is clearly an exponential decrease.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.230
As we add a constant to n, the probability decreases by a certain factor

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.270
and that factor is one-tenth or ever worse.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.370
So we definitely can see an exponential decrease of the success probability as a function of n.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.870
Now, the exact analysis of this algorithm is not within the scope of this course,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.210
although I would say it's understandable if have had a

00:00:40.210 --> 99:59:59.000
mid-level college course on probabilities and statistics.
