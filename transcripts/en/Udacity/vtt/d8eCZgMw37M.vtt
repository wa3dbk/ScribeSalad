00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.839
All right.
So hopefully you have a better

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.220
understanding of why
OnClickListener is an interface

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.820
with an abstract method called OnClick.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.460
Your role as the developer is to
set up the event listeners for

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.230
the input events you want
to handle in your app.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.080
More specifically, for each listener
you will need to follow three steps.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.430
Number 1, define the event listener and

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.500
the custom behavior or
when the event happens.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.290
Number 2, create a new object instance

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.278
of the event listener by
calling the constructor.

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:33.440
And number 3, attach the listener to the
view you want to listen for events on.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.170
And then I'll show you the code
you need at each step.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.070
First we need to define an event
listener class that implements

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.990
the interface.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.310
You can call it anything you want as
long as it follows the Java conventions

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.840
for naming classes.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.255
In this case,
we named the class NumbersClickListener.

00:00:48.255 --> 00:00:52.580
And this code is located in a new filed
called, NumbersClickListener.java.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.210
When we define the NumbersClickListener
class, the declaration should say,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.530
public class, followed by the name
of the class, followed by the word

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.930
implements, and then the interface name,
which is OnClickListener in this case.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.240
So note that implements is a Java
key word that has a special meaning.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.870
And you can find a list of
these special key words

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.060
in the Java Oracle documentation here.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.270
We use implements to express that the
NumbersClickListener class will support

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.450
the specified interface and provide
code for all it's abstract methods.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.150
By implementing
the OnClickListener interface, for

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.460
every piece in the Android code that
expects an OnClickListener object type,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.570
we can use the NumbersClickListener.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.810
And right before the method we
have this @Override annotation.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.550
This means that we are overriding
the blank method in the interface and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.280
providing our own implementation.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.969
Our implementation of the OnClick method
is that we want a toast message to pop

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.390
up that says, open the list of numbers.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.900
We could've provided any
other customer behavior here.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.010
This is just an example.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.480
Once we define our numbers,
clickListener class.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.630
We need to create
an object instance of it.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.050
If you remember from the last course,
we have the class template, but

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.360
we need to create
object instances of it.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.990
We just created a floor plan,
but we need an actual house.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.230
Remember back to the syntax for
creating an object using a constructor.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.229
To create a NumbersClickListener
object instance,

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.660
we can call the constructor for
the class with the new keyword.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.100
This creates a new object that
we can store in this variable

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.218
on the left-hand side,
where the variable is of this data type.

00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:20.320
Within the Miwok app,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.080
this is what the code looks
like in the main activity file.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.900
We modify the main activity so that we
can immediately start listening for

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.600
click events as soon as
the activity is created.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.870
We're creating a new
NumbersClickListener object and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.470
storing it in a variable
called ClickListener,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.980
which is of the variable data
type NumbersClickListener.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.040
So once we have an object instance
of a NumbersClickListener,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.790
we need to attach it to the view that
we want to listen for clicks on.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.140
And this is the code for that.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.560
Assuming we have the view stored
as a variable, called buttonView,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.150
we just need to call the set
OnClickListener method on that view and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.240
pass in one parameter argument,
the ClickListener variable.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.620
Well how do we know to call this method
with this particular input argument?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.860
Back to our handy dandy documentation.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.370
Here we'll take a look at the View
class, and it has a method

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.508
called setOnClickListener,
where you pass in an OnClickListener.

00:03:11.508 --> 00:03:14.270
Since the NumbersClickListener
implements this interface

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.070
It is also considered
an OnClickListener data type, and

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.180
we can pass that in as
an input to the method.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.640
Now let's see what the code looks
like within the context of the app.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.730
However, you won't need to
make these changes just yet.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.680
The quiz in the next video will
give you more specific instructions

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.160
on what we need to do.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.420
So just follow along and
try to understand the logic.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.010
So here I've created
a NumbersClickListener class, and

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.450
defined it in it's own Java file.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.810
Remember that we specify
the package name in the code so

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.380
that our code is bundled under
this unique package name.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.330
Then we have the import statements,
because we're using the View and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.340
Toast classes.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.560
And we can use them even though
we didn't create them ourselves,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.900
because we're importing them.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.630
Then in the class declaration,
we have implements View.OnClickListener.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.310
And I'd like to point out that
we add View.OnClickListener

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.990
to be very explicit that we're
referring to the OnClickListener

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.070
that is part of the view.java
file in this package.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.460
And recall that we use the .operator
to access Java class members.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.031
So here in the NumbersClickListener,
I have created an onClick method.

00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:21.320
And in it I've said when
the numbers category is clicked on,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.030
we choose to display a Toast message
that says, open the list of numbers.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.980
And there you have it.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.810
This is the NumbersClickListener.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.893
Now I'm going to switch
over to main activity.

00:04:30.893 --> 00:04:32.740
And at the end of the OnCreate method,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.420
we need to create a new
ClickListener object.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.420
Now we need to attach the ClickListener
to the numbers category view.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.040
However, first we need to find that
view object in the viewer hierarchy.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.190
And this process should be familiar from
the Just Java app in the last course.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.600
So here's how we're
going to write that code.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.890
So to find the view that
shows the number category.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.030
So here I call
the findViewById method and

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.860
request the view with the ID numbers.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.380
So once we find the text view,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.870
we can store in a variable that
I'm going to call numbers.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.910
Then we can call the set OnClickListener
method on this text view and

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.370
pass the ClickListener object as input.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.110
So here's how that would look.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.565
So here we set the OnClickListener
method on the text view in passing

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.757
the ClickListener object as it's input.

00:05:17.757 --> 00:05:21.487
So the TextView numbers in our case
will store the clickListener object.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:25.830
And later, if this TextView is pressed,
the ClickListener jumps into action.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.116
In order to test that this Java
code I wrote actually works,

00:05:29.116 --> 00:05:32.741
I have to delete some old code that
we wrote from the button click.

00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:34.783
So in the activity_main XML file,

00:05:34.783 --> 00:05:39.910
I'll need to delete the Android onClick
attribute on the numbers TextView.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.510
So in the main activity I'll also need
to remove the open numbers list method.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.155
And this leaves the main activity
with one method, the onCreate method.

00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:53.547
Now when I run the app on my device,

00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:55.809
clicking the numbers category
pops up a toast message.

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:56.309
Great.
Now my ClickListener code is working.
