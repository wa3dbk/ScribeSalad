First things first, f of g of x is just 1 
over x since we're squaring a square root.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.492
So looking at this, we already know that 
0 can't be in the domain of our composite

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:13.028
function but we also know, looking at our 
function g, that negative numbers can't

00:00:13.028 --> 00:00:17.745
be in the domain since we can't take 
their square roots.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.670
So that means our domain should just be 
all the positive numbers.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.449
In other words, 0 is less than x or x is 
greater than 0.
