00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.340
Continuous integration is the idea
that you're always making sure your

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.490
code can be integrated with
the remote repository..

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.645
So across a team,
you'll always have a stable build.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.690
Now we won't go into detail on CI,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.070
as much of it is already covered
in the dev ops udacity course.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.130
But a key lesson here is that CI in
the cloud provides a great place for

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.860
your time intensive tasks.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.450
In particular, your unit tests.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.120
A cloud solution like Jenkins will watch
the commits going into your repository

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.010
and trigger any terminal
commands you feed it.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.971
So if you take the Gulp test task that
we've just created and hook it up in

00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.520
the cloud, it means that the test
suite will run after every commit.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.520
But on a completely different computer,
letting you go in coding.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.990
If one of these tests now fails,
you've got a email and

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.270
can fix it in your next commit.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.467
We'll leave our task as is for
now, but do go and

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:50.540
check out the dev ops Udacity course
when you're finished with ours.
