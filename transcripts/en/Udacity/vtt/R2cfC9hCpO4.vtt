00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.530
Let's get back to the HTTP request.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.070
We need to specify some additional
details that are essential

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.990
before establishing
the network connection.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.285
So far the HttpUrlConnection object only
contains the destination we want for

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:19.025
this request, we still need to define
the action that the server should

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:21.275
perform on the request.

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:25.865
This is expressed using one of the HTTP
verbs we described earlier such as GET

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:27.335
or POST.

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:32.220
The next step is to make sure you
set the desired HTTP method which

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.450
allows you to be explicit about what
exactly want to do with HTTP connection.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.370
There are few common HTTP method types
or actions that you should be aware of.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.530
When we're getting information
to be return to us.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.300
The best method to use is GET.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.650
There are several
methods to use in HTTP.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.880
Well get is the most commonly used
option, POST is also frequently used

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.950
when you need to update some information
on a server such as when you update

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.950
a blog post or you're entering billing
information or shopping online.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.950
In other words,
a GET request is typically

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.780
reading information from the server and
sending it back to the client.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.390
Well a POST request is generally
contains information to be written to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.830
the server.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.690
Check out the list and
notes for links and

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.079
where you can learn more about
the various other HTTP methods.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.500
For example,
when you enter a URL into a web browser,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.230
a GET request containing the destination
URL is generated and sent to the server.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.730
This request also contains a header
section which includes metadata

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.040
about the request.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.330
This includes things like
what types of languages and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.170
encodings the client can accept,
an information about

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.418
the client has operating system
in the screen dimensions.

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:50.380
Mobile apps do the exact same thing,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.410
when they are requesting
information from a server.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.200
So how do you know what request
method to set, while you can check

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.860
the documentation for the given
API they are using to confirm it.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.160
Each API endpoint should be explicitly
documented with a HTTP action required.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.120
It should be consistent with the GET and
POST behavior we explained earlier

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.000
in cases where no action is
specified GET is typically assumed.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.460
For example,
let's go back to the Twitter public API.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.940
There are many endpoints provided
to fetch information about users,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.520
tweets, friends or account information.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.150
Twitter specifies up front whether
any of these endpoints are GET or

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.040
POST requests.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.800
Let's click on this API endpoint
which let's us get the most recent

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.160
tweets posted by a user.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.960
If I scroll down a bit I
can find the resource URL

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.540
where we can make the HTTP request.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.560
And GET is the HTTP request
method type because we're

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.890
reading the existing tweets
from the Twitter server.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.770
There are many other examples where we
make GET requests to get the list of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.340
direct messages or
lists of friends from a user.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.820
On the other hand, if we want to
write new data to the Twitter server,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.090
we need to use a POST request.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.560
The API endpoint allows us
to point to a new tweet.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.150
Just to make a connection to a new
URL and specify the POST method type.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.360
Remember that if you make a POST request

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.580
you need to send the new
data along as well.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.540
In this case,
the message text for a new tweet.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.450
POST is used when you're writing to
the server, which means you're creating,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.070
deleting, or updating an entity.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.220
This will make the new information
available to other clients

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.570
when they perform a GET request for
the latest Tweets.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.080
Here's another quick example,
the Instagram API.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.730
These endpoints allow you to
get information about a user or

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.990
the images or video files that
they recently posted or liked.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.050
All of these requests are reading
information from the server so

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.130
they are all GET requests.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.420
On the other hand, the Instagram
comments API allows you to get or

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.710
modify the comments on POST.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.100
Here you can see the request
method type is GET, POST or DEL.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.170
Sometimes you'll see
DEL as its own action,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.165
whereas POST will be for
creating a comment.

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:15.560
DEL is for deleting a comment.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.310
Sometimes all of this behavior is
combined in a general POST request that

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.970
handles any type of modification
on the server data.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.400
It just depends on how
the API was built.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.490
For a list of all the API request
methods, see the link below.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.090
But for the purposes of this course,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.200
we just want you to become comfortable
with the distinction between GET verses

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.090
POST, or reading from verses
writing to the web server.
