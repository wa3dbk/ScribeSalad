00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.588
Why sentinel value? Well, a sentinel is like the fellow you see over here who

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:11.400
guards something. In our case the sentinel is that last input that guards the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.539
input sequence. It just says this is the end of the input sequence. Do we have

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.800
to use zero as a sentinel? No, there are other possibilities. For example,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.154
minus 1 would work if all inputs must be greater or equal 0. Or if any numbers

00:00:26.154 --> 00:00:31.683
can be inputs, you could use the letter Q. In the exercises that come, you'll

00:00:31.683 --> 00:00:34.974
explore some of these possibilities.
