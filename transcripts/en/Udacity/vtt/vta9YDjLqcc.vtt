00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.497
And the answer unfortunately is no, we can't solve this. Remember that when we

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:09.009
used the square root sign without any sign explicitly indicated outside of it.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.540
This gives us the positive square root of whatever quantity is inside. Because

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.749
we know then for sure this quantity on the left is positive, there is no way

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.990
that it can equal a negative number. Which is what's on the right side. So even

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.554
thought we now know how to solve a ton of different looking equations, probably

00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:28.902
a lot of which it didn't seem at first like we did know how to solve, there are

00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:32.516
some that are just not mathematically possible. That has nothing to do with our

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:36.050
math expertise, though. And you've done a really, really awesome job, on this

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.449
lesson and on the ones before.
