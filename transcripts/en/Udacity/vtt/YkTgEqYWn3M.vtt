00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.699
Let's get to writing some code. Now, in the Python RE module, there are two functions: search and match.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.866
Search takes a pattern, a regular expression in the form of a string as we've defined, and a text,

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:19.466
and it returns "true" if the pattern appears anywhere in the text.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:22.666
Rather, I should say I'm simplifying a little bit here.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:34.099
The Python RE module returns a more complicated result, a not literally true, but a result that is true and has some more data.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.166
But in our implementation we're just going to return "true" or "false."

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:41.599
So if the pattern occurs anywhere in the text, return "true",

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.299
and then "match" says "return true if the pattern appears at the very start of the text."

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.232
To make sure we understand what these are supposed to be returning, let's add some tests.

00:00:53.233 --> 00:01:00.199
Here we had four tests, each testing this regular expression, "baa*!"

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.232
If we search for that within the string, "Sheep said baaaa!" it should find it right here.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.632
If we search within this string, it shouldn't find it because the B and the As are there,

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:13.766
but it's not followed by an exclamation point, so that should be false.

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:19.199
If we try to match it against this string, it's false because it doesn't occur right at the start.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.399
And if we try to match it against this string, it's true because there is a match right at the start.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.499
Now, regular expressions are complicated, so I wanted to add some more tests.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.132
Just to go through, we'll check for the dollar sign, we'll check for the up arrow at the start.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:43.799
We'll check for stars, we'll check for the question mark, optional, and we'll go into more detail,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:54.566
testing a pattern against multiple possible words--at the end, at the start, in the middle, check for this dot character.

00:01:54.567 --> 00:02:00.399
And if we can do all that, then we have some confidence that our routines are working.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.766
So let's get back to the routines.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:07.599
Now, if you want, you could go ahead and try to write search and match.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.766
They're complicated, and you need to understand a little bit about the processing of regular expressions to get them right.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.399
If you feel you're up to it, go ahead and try it now.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.566
If not, I'm going to lead you through it step by step.

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:24.432
The two seem similar, so it'd be nice to write one in terms of each other.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:30.232
Let's write "search" in terms of match, although it'd be possible to do it the other way around.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:35.666
Now, a real distinction is whether a pattern starts with a up arrow or not.

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:40.566
So if we're searching, remember, a search tests against anywhere in the pattern.

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:44.832
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to check, say, "Does the pattern start with the up arrow?"

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:50.232
And the only place that the up arrow really makes sense is as the first character in the pattern.

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:55.466
If it appears elsewhere, we're gonna just consider that an error and not try to deal with it.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:03:01.466
Your program can return whatever you want if the up arrow appears in the wrong place, not right at the start of the pattern.

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:08.966
If it does return right at the start of the pattern, then we can reduce this to a match with some different pattern over the same text.

00:03:08.967 --> 00:03:15.099
And if it doesn't, then we can also return it to a match, reduce it to a match with some different pattern over the text.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.766
What I'd like you to do is fill in these two patterns to say,

00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:25.500
"What is a search expressed at in terms of a match with an up arrow and without an up arrow?"
