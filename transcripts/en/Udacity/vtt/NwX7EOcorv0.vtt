00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.420
All right, let's recap what happened.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.900
You borrowed 100 shares from Joe, so

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.870
that's indicated by this
sort of empty box here.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.130
You sold those 100 shares to Lisa.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.350
So now you have $10,000 in your account,
but you still owe Joe those 100 shares.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.620
Let's suppose that since that time,
IBM has dropped in price and

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.830
now it's selling at $90.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.200
You can make a profit from that,
and you want to go ahead and exit.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.550
So you approach Lisa and say, hey,
can I buy those 100 shares back?

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.460
And she says, no, I want to keep IBM.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.110
Well, that's a little bit of a problem,
but fortunately, there's lots of people

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.880
who have shares of IBM and
would be willing to sell them to you.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.180
So Lisa's now out of the picture and
not part of this transaction anymore.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.290
But, there is somebody else out there,
Nate, who's got a hundred shares and

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.230
he's willing to sell them.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.110
So you buy a hundred shares from
Nate and give them back to Joe.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.180
So your obligation to Joe,
is now completed.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.477
IBM was selling at $90 so
you had to give Joe $9000.

00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:08.161
But remember you had $10000, so

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:13.455
the net result after everything is
said and done is you've got a $1000.

00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:16.710
And you don't have any
obligation any longer to Joe.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.598
So that's how short selling works.

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:25.450
Now I personalized this story by talking
about Joe and Lisa and Nate and so on.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.640
In reality you don't have to make these
personal agreements with any of these

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.990
people, your broker
makes all that happen.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.820
Your broker is sitting here in
between all those actors and

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.340
making all this happen for you.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.300
Well this all sounds wonderful
doesn't it, what can go wrong?
