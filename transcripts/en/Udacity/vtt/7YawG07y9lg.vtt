The answer--I hope--is your browser went to Google search results.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll go ahead and do this with you, and let's talk about it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Okay--I'm in my editor and I'm going to add the action parameter.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I make it equal google.com/search, I save this, I go to the browser,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I reload, I type something in the box, I click submit,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and voila, we have Google search results. Pretty neat, huh?
