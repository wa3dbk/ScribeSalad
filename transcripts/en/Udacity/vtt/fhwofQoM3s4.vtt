00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.450
Disk I/O virtualization works quite similarly. Every VM has an I/O

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.900
ring which is dedicated for disk I/O. This is an I/O ring associated

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.300
with VM1. This is an I/O ring associated with VM2.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.910
Similar to network virtualization. Here also, the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.380
communication between the guest operating system and then strives

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.180
to avoid copying altogether. No copying into xen

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.430
because what we're doing is we are entering

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.310
descriptors for the disk I/O that we want

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.260
to get done with pointers. To the guest

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.360
operating system buffers, where the data is already

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.460
contained and the transfer has to go into

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.400
the disk. Or a placeholder for the data

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.060
to come into from the disk. And the philosophy

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.200
being asynchronous I/O. Enqueuing these descriptors

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.060
into these I/O ring by the guest

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.560
operating system happens asynchronously with respect

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.730
to xen enqueuing responses back for prior

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.180
requests coming from this VM. Since xen is in charge of the actual devices,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.240
in particular in this case, the disk subsystem. It may reorder requests

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.986
from competing domains in order to make the I/O throughput

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:27.140
efficient. But there may be situations where such a request reordering may

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.320
be inappropriate from the semantics of the I/O operation. And

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.270
therefore, xen also provides a reorder barrier for guest operating

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.320
systems to enforce that do this operations in exactly the order

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.880
in which I've given them. Such a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.960
reorder barrier for instance may be necessary for

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.830
higher level semantics such as right ahead,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.020
logging, and things like that. So that completes

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.600
discussion of all the subsystems that need to be virtualized, whether it is by a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.980
fully virtualized environment or a para virtualized environment.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.980
Next, we will talk about usage and billing.
