00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.270
You have noticed visually that the key difference

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.780
was, the red line was replaced by a dotted

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.970
line, separating the application from the operating system.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.520
And what you get out of that is performance.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.960
Access to system services are going to be like

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.645
a procedure call, and what is lost in the

00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:22.500
DOS-like structure is the fact that you don't

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.420
have protection. Of the operating system from the application.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.860
An errant application can corrupt the operating system.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.549
We'll elaborate on this in the next few panels.
