00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.576
So let's look at the solution
to our 4-level page table quiz.

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:08.381
We have 2 to the 64th
bytes of address space.

00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:13.160
We have 2 to the 16th
bytes in each page.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.680
We get that there are 2 to the 48th
pages in our address space.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.800
For our flat page table, the page
table has 2 to the 48th entries,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.040
times the size of each entry,
is 2 to the 3rd.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.650
So the overall size is
2 to the 51st bytes.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.630
So the answer is here, 51.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.830
This is an enormous page table,
many, many terabytes of page table.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.900
Now let's see what the four
level page table looks like.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.400
The page number in this page table
is split across four levels.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.570
So the page number is split
into four pieces of 12 bits.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.100
The easiest way to figure out how
large the overall page table is,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.000
is to figure out how many
innermost page tables we have.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.500
4 GB worth of memory is
2 to the 32nd bytes,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.180
which is 2 to the 16th
pages of this size.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.090
So we have 2 to the 16th pages.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.527
One innermost page table has
2 to the 12th entries, so

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:20.510
it covers 2 to the 12th pages.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.606
To cover 2 to the 16th
consecutive pages,

00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:27.670
we need 2 to the 4th of these
inner most page tables.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.700
So, now we know that we have
16 innermost page tables.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.000
How many page tables at the next
level we need to point to them?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.061
Well, each table at that entry can
also have 2 to the 12th entries, and

00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:42.810
this is only 2 to the 4th.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.430
So, we need only one.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.490
So this is the page
table situation we have.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.020
The outermost page table has 2
to the 12th, or 4,960 entries.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.380
But only one of them, the first one,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.040
actually has a page
table at the next level.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.880
That page table at the next level
also has 2 to the 12th entries.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.930
But only one of them, the first one,
points to the next level of page table.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.760
That next level page
table has 16 entries

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.470
that point to innermost page tables.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.020
So overall the number of these
page tables is 1 here, 1 here,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.964
1 here, and 16 of these,
for a total of 19 of them.

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:35.519
The size of each of these small page
tables is the number of entries,

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.860
2 to the 12th times the size
of an entry, 2 to the 3rd.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.000
So the size of each one of
these is 2 to the 15th bytes,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.950
which corresponds to 32 kilobytes.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.150
So overall we have 19 page
tables at various levels,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.760
each of which is 32 kilobytes.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.410
So the solution here is 19 x 32.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.030
So the final answer is 608 kilobytes.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.100
As you can see, this is only 608
kilobytes, less than a megabyte.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.400
Compare that to many many
terabytes of page table for

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.670
a flat page table organization.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.670
This is why all 64 bit X86 processors,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.400
nowadays, use multi-level page
tables of at least three levels.
