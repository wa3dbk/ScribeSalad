00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.160
There's a few things that I'd like you
to clean up now that we actually have

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.500
user data to use and users logging in.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.880
First, I'd like you to remove
all mention of Anonymous Owner.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.490
We know who the logged in users are now,
so

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.530
we shouldn't need to fall back on this.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.540
Instead, you should store the email
address of the current user.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.610
I'd also like you to finish the goal we
had in all of this, which was to change

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.300
the main activity screen to show the
user's name and then lists, like this.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.820
We're also using the encoded
version of their email

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.780
as the key to their user data entry.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.300
Because of this, if we simply have
the encoded email everywhere in the app,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.270
we can easily load up any
associated data with the user.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.730
When the user logs in
in the login activity,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.490
we have access to their email
through the off data object.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.030
And at that point we can encode it,
which I'd like you to do in step three.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.950
And the fourth thing
that I'd like you to do,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.590
is to store the encoded email as
the current user in shared preferences.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.390
You should also store the provider
that's being used there as well.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.350
This will be helpful because it
will allow you to easily grab this

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.400
information anywhere from the app.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.300
It also makes this information
available to us on load,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.030
if the user happens to close the app.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.040
Okay, the full spec is on its way,
let me transfer it.
