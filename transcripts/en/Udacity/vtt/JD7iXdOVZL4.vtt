00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.766
There is a second time constant that often is used to describe decay processes:

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:11.299
The half-life, as opposed to the lifetime, which we've covered before.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.699
After the half-life, half of the particles have decayed, half of them are still there.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.266
Often, this is written as T subscript one half.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:24.632
What's the relation between half-life and lifetime?

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:33.833
Is the lifetime smaller than the half-life? Is it equal to the half-life? Or is it larger than the half-life?
