00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.605
The car's instance methods look pretty good. Now you're going to implement the

00:00:03.605 --> 00:00:08.320
addFriend method for the person class. We decided earlier that the person class

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.740
will need instance variables for name and friends. Now the code for add friend

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.850
will go here. Before you can go this, I need to tell you a couple things about

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.482
strings and instance variables. You can add strings. If I make a string,

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:28.880
addedStrings, which is TJ plus Jamesha, addedStrings now contains TJJamesha.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.450
You can add together as many strings as you want. Now to talk about instance

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.440
variables. A person object can read the name of another person object,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.930
friend.name will give you the name of the new friend. There's one more thing. I

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.540
told you earlier that we should store the names in a string separated by

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.310
spaces. So I don't want it to look like TJ Jamesha all crammed together I want

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.260
a space in between each name and the name following it. Now its your turn to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.739
implement the addFriend method.
