00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.551
We can rewrite this first term, natural log of 4x minus 6 to the 1 half, using

00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:10.448
the power property. That tells us that this is equal to 1 half times the

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:17.008
natural log of 4x minus 6. That means having started off with the natural log

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:22.216
of the square root of 4x minus 6 over 3, we've expanded this to equal 1 half ln

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:27.420
of 4x minus 6, minus ln of 3. Awesome!
