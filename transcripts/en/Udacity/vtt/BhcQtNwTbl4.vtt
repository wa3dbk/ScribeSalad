00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.708
It turns out, any parallel lines will have the same slope. I can draw more

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:08.750
lines on this graph, and all these lines have a slope of negative two thirds.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.106
This should make sense that they're parallel because, this slope goes down two

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:18.181
and right three, negative two, positive three. The same is true for the blue

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:20.789
line. To move to another point of the line, we travel two units down and three

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.504
units right. It's the same slope for both lines, pretty cool.
