00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.210
The chief goal of a virtual memory system

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.430
is to provide a process with the abstraction that

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.630
it has an address space all to itself,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.560
typically organized like this. We have addresses for the

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.870
program code. We have addresses for variables that

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.920
are initialized, literals, constants, things like that. Space for

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.850
uninitialized global variables that we expect to change over

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.780
the course of the program. Space for the heap

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.860
which is dynamically allocated and might grow or shrink over

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.080
the course of the program and space for the user

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.400
stack the procedures, local variables, all that sort of thing.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.840
There are also addresses reserved for the kernel, we'll see

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.030
how this improves efficiency later in the lesson. The advantage

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.330
of this abstration are best seen from the compiler's perspective.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.980
The compiler can choose an address for a local variable

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.970
or code for the body of a procedure without having

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.330
to worry about what other processes might be running on the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.250
computer at the same time as the application is compiling. And what

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.160
physical memory those applications might be using. He gets to pretend that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.720
the application and the OS will have the computer entirely to themselves.
