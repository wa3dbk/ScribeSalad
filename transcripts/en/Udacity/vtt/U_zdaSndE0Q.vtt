00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.390
One of the first challenges with developing for mobile devices

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.400
is the display screen. The typically small screen, compared to a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.810
desktop or laptop display, forces you to focus on what's really

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.080
critical for users. If the user on a phone sees your

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.730
investor relations link on your mobile web app's homepage, you're probably

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.380
doing it wrong. Unless your app is for an investment firm.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.370
But of course, if you have more surface, you want to

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.510
use it. You don't want the small bit of text in

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.650
a big empty window design either. In fact, this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.330
has what's led to the recent adoption of the mantra,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.050
mobile first. It's not really about writing a mobile web

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.920
app or a page before the desktop one. It's really

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.310
about stripping your app or page down to its core

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.850
user functions. And then layering additional gravy back on top,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.730
if you have appropriate room. This lesson and the following

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.710
ones are designed to give you tools to build designs

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.650
that can scale across multiple screen sizes and scenarios.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.800
Now, the complexity of these lessons may lead you

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.910
to ask the question, hey, do I need to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.310
be building one site that scales across desktop and mobile

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.790
or can I just have a separate mobile site?

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.030
No. Okay, that's a little strong, but there are

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.070
still problems with having separate mobile and desktop sites.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.340
Which of these might be problems that you would encounter?
