00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.878
This ellipse would be centered at the origin and it would have an a value of 6

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:08.160
and it would have a b value of 4. Great thinking if you got each of these

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.132
correct. We know the center is 0,0 since this fits the general formula for our

00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:17.230
ellipse. There's no number next to the x inside parenthesis and there's no

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.752
number next to the y inside our parenthesis. So we know our ellipse is centered

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:26.725
at 0, 0. To find the a value we want to take the square root of this

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:31.668
denominator of 36. And the square root of 36 equals 6 which means we go 6 units

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:37.106
in the left direction and in the right direction. Remember the a term indicated

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:41.632
which way we move in the x direction. Since the a number is directly underneath

00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:46.588
the x squared term. For b, we just need to take the square root of 16, which

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:51.510
equals 4. So, to get two other points on our ellipse, we move 4 units up from

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.605
the center, and 4 units down from the center. This gives us four easily

00:00:56.605 --> 00:01:01.350
identifiable points, and we can connect our ellipse. Remember that this was our

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.782
general formula for an ellipse centered at the origin. So we need to find the

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:10.254
square root of 36 and the square root of 16. I think it's always more helpful

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:14.110
to write these as perfect squares if you can. Comparing the equations like

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.326
this, we can quickly see that the value of a equals 6 and the value of b equals

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:20.020
4.
