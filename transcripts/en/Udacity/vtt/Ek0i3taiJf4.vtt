00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.660
Now it's time to set up the routing for
application.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.900
In the mock-ups, we specify routes for
the following pages.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.550
Note that landing on the root page
of our site will now route us to

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.630
the page that shows all
of the restaurants.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.640
And, visiting /restaurant/menu ID will
automatically take us to the menu page.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.165
Create a new Python file called,

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:20.410
finalproject.py in the same
directory as all of our other files.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.400
Import the Flask module and the app.run
code, like in the previous lesson.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.360
Add the routing for
all pages into finalproject.py and

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.960
create the following methods that return
the appropriate messages in the browser.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.590
When you save and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.470
fire up your browser, you should be
able to visit all of the URLs like so.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.830
At the end of this iteration,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.160
you have shown that you can
get a Flask application up and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.080
running, accounting for all
the necessary pages your app will have.
