00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.010
Using the process that I just
showed you, I went ahead and

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.740
made up a little bit of a draft for

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.300
the rules that I think we might
want to use in ShoppingList++.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.180
And I just outlined them in English,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.050
because I'm going to want you
to eventually implement these.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.070
Now, just as a caveat,
I know this is not a complete list.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.160
I'm sure there's plenty of
additional validation rules,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.980
and maybe some read-write rules
that you can add into this.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.540
But it's at least a start.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.150
Okay, so let's take a look.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.170
I started off with the users note here.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.640
And it probably looks
pretty darn familiar.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.440
I think the biggest
thing to point out is,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.640
I went ahead and indented this
hasLoggedInWithPassword property.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.110
And I tried my best to
do some indentation

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.370
to imply where I think
the rule should be placed.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.230
But as always, use your best
judgment about rule placement.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.200
The rules pretty much follow
what I explained before.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.800
So let's go ahead take
a look at userLists next.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.330
Scroll down, and this is for
a specific user.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.040
I decided that we're probably
not going to have read or

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.760
write rules for the entire list
of all user lists in the app.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.140
But for a single user shopping list,
there is a read rule,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.392
and it basically says that each user
should be able to read their own lists.

00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:10.920
But there's no real reason why any other
user should be able to read another

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.580
user's shopping lists.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.190
That's probably a bit of
a privacy concern if they could.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.860
Now I didn't put a write rule at this
level, because that would basically say

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.370
that somebody could do a bulk write,
like write three shopping lists at once.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.100
And you never really do that in the app.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.850
You always write one list at a time,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.590
which is why down here I have
a write rule for a single list.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.910
For single lists that
are part of a user list,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.990
you need to give specific
write privileges.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.216
And what this permission here is
basically saying, is that the owner of

00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:42.620
the shopping list, which is different
than the owner that I mention here.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.745
But the owner of the specific shopping
list that's being written can add that

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:48.469
list, or can delete that list.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.628
So an example of this is that within the
app, the delete menu option should only

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:55.500
be visible to the owner
of that shopping list.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.262
So say Kaguri has a shopping list
that she creates called list A, and

00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:01.830
she shares it with Walter and myself.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.630
Now she's the owner of
that shopping list.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230
But that shopping list
is now in Walter and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.350
my user lists,
because we have access to it.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.990
As the owner of the list, she has the
permission to be able to go ahead and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.508
delete that shopping list.

00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:18.580
And she then needs to go into
each of our user lists and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.740
delete that shopping
list from our user lists.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.650
And with this write rule she
should be allowed to do that,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.240
because she's the owner of
that specific shopping list.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.832
Okay, but note that we don't give any
editing privileges at this level.

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:32.486
And that's because I didn't want to
make it so that all of the properties of

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:35.420
a shopping list could be edited or
editable in the same way.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.100
So down here for

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.560
each of these properties, I define
who can edit them more explicitly.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.120
And I also have a couple of
additional validate rules

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.240
that go beyond the structural
stuff that we talked about before.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.800
Okay, so next, our shopping list items.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.500
There's no part of the app where you're
reading all shopping list items in

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.540
every single shopping list.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.330
So again, this is for
a specific shopping list.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.570
Anyone who is shared on the list, or

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.610
the owner of the list itself,
should be able to read the items, so

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.900
that they can be displayed in the active
list details activity, activity.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.850
Writing is a little bit more
complicated since it varies

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.460
from property to property.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.830
Since you add items one at a time, the
only write action that can be done for

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.810
the whole list is to delete it.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.320
Anyone who's shared on the list
could add a single item.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.390
And furthermore, if the item is not
bought, I say that either the owner of

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.670
the list or the owner of the item
can remove or edit the item.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.120
This is not entirely true, since in
the app the owner cannot edit items.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.520
But for the sake of brevity, the rules
won't specify that you can't do that.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.380
Again, if you want to take

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.540
the time to get a little bit more
specific in the rules, that's awesome.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.050
Okay, so just as I did with user lists,
I go down here to the specific

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.190
properties and have some additional
write and validate rules.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.800
For example, we have validate rules that
make sure that if an item is bought,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.500
it has a boughtBy user.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.510
Okay, let's go down to
the sharedWith node.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.160
Like items, the sharedWith node is
tied to a specific shopping list.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.880
And this node needs to be readable
by anybody that is on the list,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.330
because every time you
update a list property,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.060
we have this lookup where you see
who else is shared on the list, and

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.450
then use that to then update
everybody else's shopping list.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.550
Writing to the shared list,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.740
which basically means the ability
to share that list and add and

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.430
remove users, is restricted to
the owner of the shopping list.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.390
And they can either completely add
a user or completely remove a user, but

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.860
they can't edit specific
properties of users,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.892
which is why I explicitly say add and
remove.

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.880
Finally, userFriends is
restricted both read and

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.744
write to just the user that
owns that list of userFriends.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.320
Okay so this is just a draft summary
of the rules that I came up with, and

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.000
again if you think there are a couple of
additional rules that you'd like to add,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.930
definitely go for it.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.590
I encourage you to add them and
make ShoppingList++ more secure.
