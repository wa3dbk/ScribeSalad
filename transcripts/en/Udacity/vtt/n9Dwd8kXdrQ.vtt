00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.660
Version spaces is a technique for learning concepts incrementally.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.370
This means that a technique is going to learn from a small set of examples,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.360
that are going to arrive one example at a time. Now we have come across

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.830
a different notion of incremental concept learning earlier. In that technique,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.780
we started with a current concept definition.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.240
Then a new example will come about. In this case it's a negative example,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.810
not an arch. And then a new concept characterization would be constructed,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.310
by revising the concept characterization that we began with. The revision was

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.400
such that, the new concept characterization was a specialization of

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.020
the old concept characterization, such that that the example got excluded. So,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.290
negative examples led to specialization, positive examples led to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.900
generalization, and the ordering of these examples was important.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.260
We want the first example to be a positive example of the concept that we

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.940
learned. We want the order to include both positive, and negative examples.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.700
That technique was very useful when there was a teacher available,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.710
who would give you these examples in the right order. Now, the order of

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.760
examples was very important in that technique of incremental concept learning.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.390
We want this set of examples to include both positive and negative examples, so

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.720
that we can do generalization, and specialization. And we want each example to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.630
differ from the previous concept characterization in only one important feature.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.520
In this case, the only important difference between the new example, and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.200
the current concept characterization is the two bricks touch each other That,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.130
the new example, the first one, the current concept characterization in exactly

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.250
one feature, is important. Because it focuses the attention of the learner.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.910
It tells the learner, how to do the specialization, or the generalization, so as

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.480
to include the difference, or to exclude the difference. This technique is very

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.130
useful if we teachers have a label that can give the examples in a good order,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.080
in the right order, so that effective learning can occur. In that technique of

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.560
incremental concept learning. We also consider the rule of background knowledge.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.780
If the current concept characterization is brick, or wedge at the node, and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.780
the learner has background knowledge which tells it that bricks, and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.490
wedges are examples of blocks, then the learner can generalize from brick, or

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.470
wedge to a block here. But now we can ask two questions. What happens if these

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.470
two factors? The presence of a teacher who gives examples in a particular order.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.620
And the availability of this background knowledge tells the learner exactly how

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.790
far the generalize. In general, in learning, deciding how much to generalize.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.910
Is a big problem. Learners tend to either over-journalize,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.540
in which case they come to incorrect answers. Or

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.220
they tend to under-journalize, in which case the answer might be correct but

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.190
not very useful. If a child comes across a dog that is hooligan, furry, black,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.430
and called Buddy, and the child decides that a dog by definition is.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.270
Four legged, furry, black, and called Buddy. Then that is an example of

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.380
under generalization. The conceptual characterization is correct, but

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.550
not very useful because we're not transfer to any other dog. On the other hand,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.170
if the trial decides that all four legged, furry animals, are dogs, then

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.730
it's an example of over generalization. Because it could also include many cats.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.170
So, the question now becomes what would happen if the examples did not

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.730
come in the good order? They came in an arbitrary order. And if this background

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.690
knowledge was not available, in that case the agent would have a hard time

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.850
deciding how far to generalize. Versions places this technique that are in

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.440
a certain conditions, allows the agent to converse to the right generalization.
