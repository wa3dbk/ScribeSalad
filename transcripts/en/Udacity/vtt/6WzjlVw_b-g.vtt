00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.890
Now once again let's think about the semantics of RPC.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.200
The client has made the call and the client is

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.220
blocked and since the client is blocked, we don't need

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.420
to buffer the message on the client's side. If the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.710
message gets lost for some reason, you don't hear back

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.210
the result of the RPC from the destination, in a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.350
certain amount of time, you can resend the call, from

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.850
the client side. And therefore you don't have to buffer

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.460
the client side RPC message but it can

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.450
reconstruct the client side message and resend the call.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.510
Therefore client side buffering is something that you

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.090
can get rid of, once again, because the LAN

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.320
is reliable. The next source of overhead, similar

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.240
to client side buffering, happens on the server side,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.160
and that is the server is sending the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.450
results and the results may get lost. LAN reliable

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.675
may not happen that often but it could happen

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:56.850
,and therefore we do want do the buffering. On

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.320
the server side because if we don't buffer it

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.520
then you have to reexecute the server procedure to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.720
produce a result and that's not something that you

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.920
want to do because it involves reexecuting the server procedure

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.510
which may be much more latency intensive then simply

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.790
buffering the packet that corresponds to the result of

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.850
executing the server procedure so you do want to buffer

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.260
on the server site but. The buffering on the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.040
server side can be overlapped with the transmission of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.890
the message. So in other words the result has been

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.020
computed by the server procedure. Now go ahead and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
send the result. While you are sending the result back

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.380
to the client, do the buffering. That you can

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.450
overlap the service side buffering with the result transmission, and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.000
get it out of the critical path

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.320
of the latency for protocol processing. So, removing

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.100
low level asks, employing hardware check sum and

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.010
not doing check sum in software. Eliminating client

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.340
side buffering all together. And overlapping the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.040
server side buffering with the result transmission are

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.720
optimizations that you can do. In protocol processing,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.980
recognizing that the LAN is reliable and therefore

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.440
we don't have to focus so much on

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.370
the reliability of message transmission. But focus rather on

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.040
the latency, and how we can reduce the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.280
latency, by making the protocol processing lean and mean
