00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer are those 2.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Those, I used in a Job Talk of 2003.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But I previously applied at Stanford and actually received an offer,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which I turned down, in 1998.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And in my earlier work, I didn't understand particle filters,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I did everything with this filter over here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But came 2003, I was a big, big fan of particle filters

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and my Job Talk talked about a version of those

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that applied them to the somewhat more involved

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
robot mapping problem.
