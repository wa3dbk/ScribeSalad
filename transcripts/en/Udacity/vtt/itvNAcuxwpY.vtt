00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
Now, the answer is rather obvious because I've already told you that we don't know if P=NP

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.540
and actually, we believe that it isn't the case.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.090
The interesting part about this one here is why is the answer no,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.130
and the answer is that v might actually be exponential in n.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.510
So when we build this table here and you remember it has n rows and it has v columns,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.730
v could be some exponential function of n, so v could for example be 2^n

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.100
because we haven't specified the maximum value of those objects here.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.970
And that is why this algorithm is a pseudopolynomial algorithm because it looks

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.360
very polynomial, but actually there are cases where it is not polynomial.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.910
But you can already see why I said at the beginning that knapsack seems to be one of the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.950
rather simple NP complete problems--simply because the existence

00:00:46.950 --> 99:59:59.000
of the pseudopolynomial algorithm here.
