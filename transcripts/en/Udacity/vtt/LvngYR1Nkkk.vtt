00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here is what the splay tree code in an editor called Emaxx, 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and this is my personal editor of choice.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's doing syntax highlighting and indenting, very much likely Udacity online IDE would do for you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But here what I'm doing is running this on my local PC here. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And so we can see is, we have a splay tree class, it's a port and insert method.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The remove method, this takes a key out of the tree or couple of other operations.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So insert, remove, and look out for the basic operations supported by any binary search tree,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but many implementations support additional operations.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So find the look out for operation for this tree.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And then there's the splay operation and what the splay does is,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it moves a particular key up to the root of the binary search tree up to the root of the splay tree.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This serves as both the balancing operation for the splay tree and also the look up.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, the splay routine involves a couple of screenfuls of codes but it's still fairly simple. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And now, let's look quickly at the test suite first.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So the author of this open source splay tree for the test suite.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In this test suite, you can see imports the Python module unit test

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And what unit test does is basically provides a little bit of infrastructure for running unit tests.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And so, what it's going to do is automatically call these different functions,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which are defined for an object inherited from the case test framework

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And you can see here, that what we do is for example,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we have a setup routine that initializes a list of keys.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We make ourselves a new splay tree and insert those 10 elements into the tree.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We have a test insert function which loops over

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
all of the elements of the tree and asserts that they're found.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We have a remove test function which is going to be called last in our test suite. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The functions beginning with a string TEST are called in alphabetical order,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and this happens through the last one.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This is going to remove all of the keys from the tree.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Then finally, we have a function which is going to insert a large number of elements in the tree.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's going to insert 40,000 elements into the tree.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's going to make sure that they get staggered by a gap of 307.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This is basically going to end up stress testing our splay tree a little bit.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Finally, we have a routine that tests whether the tree correctly knows that it's empty.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Okay, so this is our sort of minimal unit test.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What we can do is, we can run this and this is going to take just a couple of seconds to run.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Okay, so all of those tests took about 1.6 seconds to run

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and what I'm going to do now is run the same test under a code coverage string. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So, I'm doing here is erasing code coverage date which has been previously stored in this directory. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Running the splay test under the coverage framework 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
which is basically going to run an instrument and version of the code  

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and we'll talk about how this all works a little bit later and what it means,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and then we're going to generate some HTML.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So, what you can see is it ran quite a bit slower this time because

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
instrumenting the code to measure a coverage

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
has a lot of instructions to the code and this takes extra time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Okay, now we're going to look at the output.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Here we are looking at the output of the code coverage tool

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and what it's telling us is that when we run the splay tree on it's own unit test,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
out of the 98 statements in the file, 89 of them got run, 9 of them failed to run,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and we'll talk about this excluded business later.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So, the language didn't get run are marked in red.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And so this first one we're going to skip over for now and let's look at the second example.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So, the second line that didn't get run is in the splay trees insert function,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but what we can see is that the test suite failed to test the case

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
where we inserted an element into the tree and it was already there.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And if you look at this, this looks fairly harmless, we're just erroring out but we're not going to worry about this one right now.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, let's move on a little bit.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So, here we got something a little bit more interesting. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So here we're in the splay tree's removing function.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So, we're going to remove an element from the tree.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And so what you can see is that the first thing this function does is, 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
splays the tree based on the key to be removed,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and so this is intended to draw that key up to the root note of the tree.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
If the root note of the tree does not have the key that we're looking for,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
then we're going to raise an exemption saying that this key wasn't found.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But the thing's noticed here is that this wasn't tested.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If we look below here and go on to the body of the delete function,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we see a pretty significant chunk of code that wasn't tested, probably want to go back and revisit this. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And so, let's take a step back and think about what coverage tool is telling us here.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's basically showing us what we didn't think to test with the unit test that we wrote so far.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, what we're going to do is go ahead and fix the unit test a little bit in order to test this case.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
In order to test the case of removing an element from the tree where it's not there,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
so let's go ahead and do that.
