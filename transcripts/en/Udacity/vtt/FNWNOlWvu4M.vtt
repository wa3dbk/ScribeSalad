00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.430
So we now know how health data is shared
and how it is protected along the way.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.195
But what about the data itself?

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:10.157
How is it represented?

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:13.180
How is it packaged into documents?

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.680
And how are those documents
actually transmitted?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.160
For that,
we now turn to lessons five A and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.090
B on data and
interoperability standards.
