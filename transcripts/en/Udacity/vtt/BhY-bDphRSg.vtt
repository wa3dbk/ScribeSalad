00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.740
So first of all, we need our activity
to implement the various callbacks and

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.110
listeners that we've
been discussing about.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.597
So, you can see here our public
class MainActivity already extends

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:12.030
ActionBarActivity.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.850
We want to implement a few things.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.620
So we want it to
implement the following.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.064
It's going to implement
GoogleApiClient.ConnectionCallbacks,

00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:24.900
GoogleApiClient.ConnectionFailedListe-
ner, and the location listener.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500
Instead of you watching me typing,
I'm just going to paste these in.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.550
I've now added these, but
we can see we have a few errors

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.130
because some of the symbols
haven't been resolved.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.840
You just need to import the correct
libraries to resolve them, and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.160
I've added those libraries here.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.230
We can now see that we still have an
error, and that's because there are some

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.250
methods that need to be implemented and
we haven't implemented them yet.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.810
But we will be doing
that in just a moment.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.210
Before we do that, there's a few
things that I want to add to the code.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.670
First up, we just want to add a tag,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.710
which is a string,
to the code that allows you to track

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.910
the name of this application if
we're writing it out to the log.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.370
So we do that with a private
final string, it's called tag.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.060
And you can put whatever
you like in there.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.200
I'm just going to put LawrenceTestApp
and the code would look like this.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.800
Next there's a few local variables that
we need to set up within this class.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.220
Things, for example, for tracking
the text view that we call TxtOutput,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.710
the Google API client itself,
and a location request object.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.000
So I'll add these now.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.960
You can see when I added them in,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.280
it detected that it needed
to import this class.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.800
So just go ahead and say okay to that.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.450
And the class will be imported.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.790
So you can see here I have a TextView
object that I'm calling txtOutput

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.560
that will just be used to
address the TextView on the UI.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.410
I have a GoogleApiClient that
I call mGoogleApiClient.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.590
And I have a LocationRequest
that I call mLocationRequest.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.100
Okay, now in our onCreate method,
we need to set up the GoogleApiClient.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.800
And we use this with
a GoogleApiClient builder, and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.160
we add the requisite APIs to that.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.700
Let's add this code and
then we can talk through it.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.580
So, we go to onCreate and
I'll add the code in here.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.100
So what it simply does is it
creates a new builder for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.350
an API client, and it adds that we
want to use the location services API

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.960
by saying just LocationServices.API
to the addAPI method.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.380
We want the connection callbacks on the
Google API client to come to this class.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.580
And we want
the OnConnectionFailedListener

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.370
also to come to this class,
and then we build it.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.950
So that's now going to give us a Google
API client that allows us to talk to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.400
Google services.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.860
Now, if you remember,
we had a UI element called a text view.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.540
And this will render
the location information.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.991
Of course, we want that text
view to be addressable in code,

00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:54.070
using this txtOutput class.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.380
So let's set up something
to do that right now.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.510
And we do that like this.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.720
We just specify that txtOutput is found
my looking for the ID, or .id.txtOutput.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.670
If you remember, when we specified the
text view in the XML for the activity,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.870
we called it txtOutput,
the same name as this.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.540
We just find that view and
then we cast it into a text view, and

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.160
now we're good to go.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.330
So just to recap,
what did we actually do here?

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.850
Well first, we created an instance of
a Google API client using its builder.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.090
We set it to use
the LocationServices API here, and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.590
then we told it what the callbacks for
OnConnectionFailed were this,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.380
so we're going to be handling
them within this class, or

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.240
within this activity, and
then we hooked up to text view to code.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.910
You've actually done a lot but
there's still more to come.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.300
So let's have a quick quiz first.
