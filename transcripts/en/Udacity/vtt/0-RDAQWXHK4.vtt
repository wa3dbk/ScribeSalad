00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.550
What choices did you pick David?

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.840
&gt;&gt; So there's a few different ways we
can do the mapping between the sun,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.740
the planet on the left and the nucleus
and the electron on the right.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.090
If we look only at the top half of each
representation all we can really say

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.510
is that the sun must map to one of them
and the planet must map to one of them.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.550
Because these relationships
are symmetrical,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.210
if I don't consider the bottom half
it wouldn't matter which is which.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.690
If I look at the bottom half of
the representations however,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.848
it tells me which part of the Solar
System must correspond to which part of

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:27.930
the Atomic Structure.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.410
The planet revolves around the Sun, and

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.550
the electron revolves
around the nucleus.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.240
So the planet and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.050
the electron must correspond because
both are doing the revolving and the Sun

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.970
and the nucleus must correspond because
they are the centers of the revolution.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.540
So, the sun corresponds
to the nucleus and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.010
the planet corresponds to the electron.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.320
&gt;&gt; This is right, David.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.210
Another thing to take away from here is,
look at the depth of understanding it

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.760
requires in order to be able to make
the right kind of correspondences.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.330
If one did not have the right kind
of model for the solar system and

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.960
atomic structure that captures
the deep relationships,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.930
then the mapping may not be done and
the alignment wouldn't work.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.430
And we would not be able to
understand the atomic structure

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.490
in terms of the solar system.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.210
This models deep and rich models of
the two systems, the target problem and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.260
the source case are essential to
deciding how to align them, how to map

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.870
them, and as we will see in a moment,
what to transfer and how to transfer it.
