00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.196
Now you've seen that by knowing the mean and standard deviation of a normally

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:10.623
distributed population, we can compare any value in that population to the rest

00:00:10.623 --> 00:00:15.888
of the population by determining the percent less than or the percent greater

00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:20.867
than that value. But what about for a sample, how can we compare a particular

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:25.872
sample in a population to other samples in that population? By finding the mean

00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:31.038
of this sample, by finding the means of other samples in this population, or

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:36.752
maybe by comparing the mean of this sample to the other samples. Check all that

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:37.429
apply.
