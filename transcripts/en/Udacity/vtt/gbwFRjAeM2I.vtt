00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.860
The code to make the right grabber is essentially the same as for the left

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.200
grabber. The slightly tricky bit is what you need to add to the render method.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.656
You have to move the right grabber in the negative z direction when the slider

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:10.043
is slid.
