00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.850
Think about this. Everything you see, hear, feel, taste, and touch all happen

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.578
because of our nervous system. So every day, millions of sensory stimuli enter

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:17.255
our brains. Our brains interpret those and allow us to engage in our behaviors

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:22.704
and be successful. Every minute, thousands and thousands of neurons are firing,

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:26.067
and it makes our behaviour seem fluid and effortless, when in fact it's

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:31.838
actually quite complicated. Let's take a look at an everyday example that shows

00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:37.354
how our nervous system allows us to be successful human beings. Something

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:41.738
amazing is about to happen. Lauren is about to see and then touch a dog, you

00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:47.494
may think amazing, how boring and everyday. But in fact, it really is an

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:52.646
amazing process. Let's take a look at it a little more carefully. First, Lauren

00:00:52.646 --> 00:00:57.978
sees Sputnik. The light waves enter her eye, stimulate sensory neurons in the

00:00:57.978 --> 00:01:03.689
retina, which then send neuro impulses to the back of the brain. The visual

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:08.375
cortex in the occipital lobe lobes or the information get interpreted and made

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:13.607
sense of Sputnik. Next, Lauren decides to be friendly with Sputnik and reaches

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:17.190
down to pet him. For that to happen, something else needs to happen in Lauren's

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.139
brain. It has to send a signal to the motor cortex involved in moving her hand

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:27.499
to reach down and touch Sputnik. This impulse gets transmitted from the motor

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:31.919
cortex in the frontal lobe to the arm via inter-neurons in the spinal cord, and

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:37.373
motor neurons in the arm. Which contract muscles in the arm and move it back

00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:42.824
and forth. When she actually touches Sputnik, sensory neurons in her fingertips

00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:48.175
send neural signals back to her brain's sensory cortex. Here she has the

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:53.512
conscious sensation of furriness. At each step in this process, hundreds of

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:59.746
thousands of interconnected neurons are firing up to 200 times per second. This

00:01:59.746 --> 00:02:03.640
whole process, from when Lauren first sees Sputnik to petting him, lasts all of

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.651
a few seconds. But look at what took place in these two to three seconds, that

00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:12.769
allow for all of this to happen. Now, perhaps you can see why we call this

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.599
every day event, amazing.
