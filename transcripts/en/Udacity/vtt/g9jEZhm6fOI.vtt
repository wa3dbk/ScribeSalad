00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.580
You have your x variable, your predictor. And then you get the outcome, which

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.403
is the y variable. X explains the response. Finally, x is independent and y

00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:17.162
depends on the value of x. These other two aren't used in statistics jargon.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:24.170
But if anything, they probably describe the x variable. Since X kind of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.530
determines what Y will be, what we can predict Y to be. In stand-alone, I don't

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.680
know. I just made that up.
