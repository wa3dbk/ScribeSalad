00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.410
You've seen git log output a few times now and

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.540
you know that it doesn't necessarily always show you every commit.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.240
So how does git log figure out which commits to show you?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.070
It turns out that each commit knows about its parent.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.300
That is, it stores a reference to

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.230
the commit that was checked out when it was made.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.860
If you were on a branch when you made the commit,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.070
it still just stores the commit ID of what was then the tip of the branch.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.330
Commit doesn't care anything about branch names.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.360
Only the branches themselves store anything about the position of the branches.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.950
To make it really clear what info is actually stored by Git,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.670
I'll include arrows in our diagram to show each commit's parent.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.820
This will become more important once we get to merging,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.002
but it's good practice to start thinking of commits as having parents now.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.890
All right, back to the question of git log.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.290
Log starts with the current commit or the latest commit of any branch or

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.950
branches that are specified and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.410
traces back until it gets to a commit that doesn't have a parent.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.400
This will generally be the initial commit.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.910
This leads us to the concept of reachability.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.620
You can see that in our diagram, there are some commits, say, this one,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.510
that can't be reached by other commits, say, this one.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.090
There's no way to get from here to here.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.709
Suppose we checked out this commit.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.190
Remember that we marked this with a star.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.732
And then we made a new commit from there, which would move head or

00:01:09.732 --> 00:01:11.490
the checkout commit to here.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.560
If you then checked out an existing branch, say, a master, then the commit

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.200
that you just made would be lost, unless you happen to have written down

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.520
the commit ID, since it's not actually reachable by any of the current branches.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.850
To drive home this concept, we've created a fictional diagram.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.410
We've used shortened Git-like commit IDs to label each commit and

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.830
we've just used letters to label the branches.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.700
Given this diagram, if I ran git log for each branch a and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.350
b, which commits would be listed?

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.950
List the commit by their shortened IDs from most to least recent and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.660
separate them with commas.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.110
Also, are there any unreachable commits in this diagram?

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.040
If so, list them here.
