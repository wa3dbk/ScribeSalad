00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.250
The second main category of UML, Diagram Systems Behavioral Diagrams.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.910
In contrast with the structural diagrams, which describe the system as a whole,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.680
the behavioral diagrams are concerned with a particular instance of behavior of

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.490
that system. That is, you may have to have multiple sequence diagrams,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.000
multiple collaboration diagrams, to convey,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.230
to give an idea of overall system behavior. We're going to now survey these so

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.840
you get a feel for what's available to you. Once again, it's unlikely that for

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.350
a given system you'll use all of these diagram types.
