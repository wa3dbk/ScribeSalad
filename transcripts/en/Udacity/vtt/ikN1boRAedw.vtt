00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.100
The correct answer is it shows a single frame of the video.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.250
If we look a little bit closer at this code,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.300
we have a function that gets executed when a play event happens.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.060
We can only count on the play event to be fired when the video's started,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.292
either for the first time or if the video was previously paused.

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:23.050
If the video is already playing, it doesn't get fired again.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.950
And therefore, this draw image only happens once.
