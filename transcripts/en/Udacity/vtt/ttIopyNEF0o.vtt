00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.599
And the direct implication, of course, is exactly opposite to the last quiz.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:13.732
So if inverse halt, given inverse halt, does not stop, then this means that halt, run on inverse halt and inverse halt, did in fact say yes,

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:18.932
because that is the only way that inverse halt can go into an infinite loop, because we know that halt is going to terminate.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:25.799
This is a direct consequence of assumption number two here, and there's no other way to go into an infinite loop.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.432
But again, something doesn't really seem quite right here when we dig a little deeper.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:37.599
So, halt running on inverse halt as the program, and inverse halt as the input, says yes.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.899
That means the following: Inverse halt as a program, when given inverse halt as an input,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.966
since halt says yes, will in fact halt. So again, we have the same contradiction here.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:53.599
We said that inverse halt running on inverse halt did not stop, or did not halt,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.766
and what we find is that the implication of this, though, is that inverse halt, when run on inverse halt, does indeed halt.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:05.166
Running the program inverse halt on inverse halt either must stop or it must not stop,

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:09.932
but no matter which one of the two we assume, we always arrive at this contradiction here.

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:15.599
Inverse halt on inverse halt stopping and not stopping at the same time, which just cannot be right.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.399
And having this contradiction here means that something either in the proof has gone wrong,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.433
or that we made some assumption along the way that cannot be true. So let's check them one by one.
