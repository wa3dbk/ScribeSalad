When the service worker
is first registered,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.180
it triggers an install event.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.280
This is the perfect time to pre-cache
all of the resources needed for

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.730
the App Shell.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.130
let's have an event listener that
will fire on the install event so

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.910
that we can cached the resources
required by the end of the App Shell.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.310
The HTML, CSS and any JavaScript.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.610
First, we need to open the cache with
caches.open and provide a cache name.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.710
Providing a cache name allows us
to version files or separate data

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.790
from the App Shell so that we can easily
update but not affect other content.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.780
Once the cache is open we can call
cache.addAll which takes a list of URL's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.200
and then fetches them from the server
and adds the response to the cache.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.710
Unfortunately, cache.addAll is atomic.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.760
If any of the files fail,
the entire cache step will fail.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.180
And I guess it would be a good idea to
provide a list of the resources that we

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.260
want to cache as part of the App Shell
