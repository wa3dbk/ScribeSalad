00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.930
Now I would like you to look at a third number, and that is this 1 here, the tour.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.380
So what is the length of the tour that this algorithm constructs here?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.880
And I'm going to give you 3 options here:

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.140
Is it equal to the weight of the tree?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.700
And by tree I mean, of course, here, the minimum spanning tree.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.340
Is it equal to 2 times the weight of the tree?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.200
Or is the length of the tour, at most, 2 times the weight of the tree?

00:00:26.200 --> 99:59:59.000
And by tree I mean the minimum spanning tree here.
