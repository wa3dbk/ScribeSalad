00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
When we write an equation like this, we're expressing y in terms of x. What

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.895
we're doing on the right side of the equation, in this expression, is taking x,

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:14.829
and then, manipulating the value of that variable in some way. That shows how

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.524
it's related to y. If our equation is y equals 2x plus 3, for example. What

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:24.244
we're saying is that, in order to get the value of y, take the value for x,

00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:28.744
multiply it by 2 and then add 3. And that will give you the number that you're

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:33.433
looking for. Since the number we plug in for x is going to help determine the

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.018
value of y, we can say that y depends on x.
