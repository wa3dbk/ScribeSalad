All right, this section is about
laying out views on your phone screen.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.710
Now if you recall, while building the
Happy Birthday app in the Android for

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.650
Beginners course, we used
something called linear layout and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.910
relative layout to arrange
views on the screen.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.840
The thing we will focus on
here is called list view.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.640
A lot of to do apps use this layout.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.210
Then we will move on to
something called a grid view,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.800
which is used by a lot
of picture sharing apps.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.300
Here we go.
