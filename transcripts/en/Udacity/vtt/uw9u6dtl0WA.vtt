00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.490
Graphs can be functionally the same but
built in a handful of different ways.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.510
If you're using an object oriented
language you could create vertex and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.520
edge objects and

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.770
give them each properties like name,
strength, ID number, etc.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.410
A vertex could have a list of edges
it's connected to and vice versa.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.520
However, operations that traverse
graphs can be more inconvenient

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.419
if you need to search through vertex and
edge objects.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.890
There are several ways to represent
connections on simple graphs

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.110
that only use lists.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.920
One example is an edge list,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.840
which is precisely what you'd think,
it's simply a list of edges.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.680
The edges themselves are represented
by a list of two elements.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.140
Those elements are normally numbers that
correspond to ID numbers for vertices.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.322
So, in the end,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:57.590
this list is just showing two nodes
that have an edge between them.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.949
And an edge list is the list that
encompasses all the smaller lists.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.190
Because our edge list contains
a list of other lists,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.840
it's sometimes called a two
dimensional list, or a 2D list.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.470
If you had a list of lists of lists,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.841
that would be called a 3D list,
and so on.

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:21.625
An adjacency list is another way
to represent edges in a graph.

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:26.311
In an adjacency list, your vertices
normally have an ID number that

00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:29.790
corresponds to the index in an array.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.920
In your array, each space is
used to store a list of nodes

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.150
that the node with our ID is adjacent to.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.530
For example, the opening at index 0
represents a vertex with an ID of 0.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.800
That vertex shares
an edge with one node, so

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.320
a reference to that node is stored
in the first spot in the array.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.320
Again, our adjacency
list is two dimensional,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.860
since it's a list that
contains other lists.
