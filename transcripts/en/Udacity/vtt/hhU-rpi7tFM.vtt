Well, no. The student has not found a number for x. The student did manipulate

00:00:04.276 --> 00:00:08.241
or change the equation up here, which is great, but we still don't know the

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:12.143
value of x. You might be able to look at the original equation and do some

00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:16.172
mental math to come up with the values for x that make the equation true, but

00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:20.138
what we're going to do in the upcoming lessons is figure out a solving method

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:21.897
for this exact kind of problem.
