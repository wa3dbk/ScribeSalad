Finally, the time has come. We're going to graph y equals 3 x minus 5. I'm going

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:08.747
to set up our x and y axis according to these ranges of values that you just

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.179
picked. So, I've drawn our basic x and y cooridinates. That we are eventually,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.814
pretty soon, I promise, going to draw these points on. But remember, we need to

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:24.309
label the crosshatches on either axis, so that we show what the scale of each

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:30.666
axis is. So, I'm going to put a box here, a box here, box here, and a box here.

00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:35.309
These are tiny boxes. Yours will show up bigger on the screen, I promise. And

00:00:35.321 --> 00:00:39.577
I'd like you to tell me for these two boxes what the x-coordinate of each one

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.933
is, and for these two boxes what the y-coordinate is for each. This is going to

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:48.478
show, basically, how much moving from here to here on the y-axis counts as we're

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.230
counting, and how much moving from here to here on the x-axis counts.
