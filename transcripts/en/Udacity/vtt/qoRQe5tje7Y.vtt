00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.950
We should get the expression 18 minus w. So for our equation, we know 18 minus

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.365
w equals l. We get this equation by taking our perimeter equation, and first,

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:17.450
dividing each term by 2. Each of these is even, so we know we can divide by 2

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.496
to get 18 equals l plus w. And finally, we just subtract w from both sides to

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:26.110
get 18 minus w equals l.
