00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:04.151
This idea is called the Mixnet. It was invented by

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:06.652
David Chaum. Any you’ll notice that this is quite

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:09.367
similar to onion routing and in fact onion

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:11.910
routing was based on this idea. There is a couple

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.725
issues we have to work out though. This kind of

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.901
encryption won't work very well. There are some

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:18.739
big problems with the way we’ve described

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.211
it so far. So supposed that we do this and we

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:24.403
encrypt this way, how well would this actually

00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:27.652
work? If we encrypt to vote as described where

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.671
you’re going to use the layered public key

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.079
encryption and the vote is the name of the

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.393
party, the voter wants to vote for and you can

00:00:34.393 --> 00:00:37.739
assume that the encryption is done using RSA

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.770
where the public keys are well-known to everyone,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.669
the private keys are kept secret to their correct

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:47.669
owners. And there are no vulnerabilities in RSA.
