00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.530
Now that we know the 0s are negative 2 3rds and positive 5, we can set up our

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.357
three intervals on our number line. Now, I want you to test each of these

00:00:08.357 --> 00:00:13.453
intervals to determine which ones are part of the solution set. Again, if you

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:16.305
plug in a value in this region and the statement winds up being true, then we

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.800
include this as part of our solution set. If the statement turns out to be

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.089
false, then we exclude the interval from the solution set.
