00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.820
For this programming exercise, you need to alter the variable tenure,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.190
so that way, it was measured in years instead of days. And

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.080
this should make a lot of sense, since 365 days would

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
be one year, and 730 days would be two years. Now for

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.370
the binwidth, let's set it equal to one so we get

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.200
a count for yearly users. Running this code, we can see our

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.860
histogram. And notice here that we have a different color. And I

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.510
did that by changing the hex code. To get a finer view

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.580
of our data, we could set the bandwidth equal to .25. It

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.880
looks like the bulk of our users had had less than two and

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.100
a half years on Facebook. To improve this plot in one more

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.510
way, I can change the x axis, so that way it increments by

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.460
one year. To do that, I can add the layer of scale

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.970
x continuous, and set the breaks from one to seven. I'm also going to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.290
limit our data so that we only see users from zero to seven

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.340
years. Writing this code, we can see we have a very nice histogram.
