00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.370
Software architecture prescribes the high level structure of a system in

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.240
terms of it's components and how they interact.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.220
A key determinate of course of the architectural is

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.040
the functionality the system must provide.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.640
Also important is that the system must satisfy a set of possibly confic,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.710
conflicting nonfunctional requirements.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.720
This lesson will provide guidance on the latter aspect.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.060
The material in the lesson is drawn from the book by Bosch listed on

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.390
the class resources page.
