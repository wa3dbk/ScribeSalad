00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.880
So, the operation of putting A on B will bring us to this state.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.800
Given this state, we can have, again,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.930
apply a means of analysis. Again, I'm not sure that all these states here, but

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.940
I'd like you to find out how many possible states are there and

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.210
how many of those states reduce the difference to the goal described.
