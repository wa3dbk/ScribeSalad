00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.210
Now that we have seen a 2 bit predictor and how it works,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.700
let's do a quiz on 2 bit predictors. Let's say, you have a 2 bit predictor,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.650
that has the four states. The 00 state is the strong not taken.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.620
Then we have the weak not taken, weak taken and the strong taken state.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.630
Let's say that we start in the strong, not taken state. And remember,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.550
that if we have a taken decision, we move towards the strong taken state and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.770
stay there as long as we have a taken decision. But for a not taken decision, we

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.240
count down towards the strong not taken state. And stay there. The question for

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.930
you is, is there a sequence of branch outcomes that results in never predicting

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.770
correctly. So is there a sequence such that when we start in this state, and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.500
here obviously we're predicting not taken, so the outcome needs to be taken. And

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.670
then after we update the predictor, we have to mis-predict again and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.050
again. If yes, there is a sequence, then write the.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.430
First five outcomes of that sequence here. If no, then put a check mark here.
