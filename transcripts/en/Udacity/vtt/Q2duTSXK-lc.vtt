00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.880
As you've probably figured out by now, Bootstrap has a lot of

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.080
really great functionality that's going to save you a lot of time.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.100
But you probably want your site to be a little bit more unique and have some

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.960
styles that are really specific to it that you can't find within Bootstrap.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.030
To include your own custom styles, you're going to need another stylesheet that

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.920
has everything you want to achieve that's not included in Bootstrap.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.510
To do so, add a new file to the css directory or

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.949
the css folder called style.css.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.070
Inside style.css, we'll include the styles that are unique to our page.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.320
Remember, you're going to want to start working with the largest elements and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.340
then move to smaller and more specific elements inside style.css.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.060
Where should you start?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.220
Would you start with the background color, the margins or padding of the page,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.390
or the font styles, including the color, typeface, and weight?
