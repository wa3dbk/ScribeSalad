00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.330
We said that we will explain why we need a better predictor in two ways.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.780
This was one way, the CPI gets a lot better. The other way will be to see

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.790
how much waste there is from a mis-prediction. So in a five stage pipeline,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.220
what's happening really we have three stages that are relevent.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.020
The one where we re, resolve the branches. And then we have to destroy two

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.608
instructions that we have fetched if this branch has been mis-predicted. So

00:00:27.608 --> 00:00:32.850
a mis-prediction costs us two instructions here. In a deeper pipeline,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.240
what happens is, we have our branch, and for ten cycles, we have been fetching

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.769
things. Some a mis-prediction now costs us ten instructions worth of work,

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.650
and that means that avoiding mis-predictions becomes more important. And

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.940
finally, when we have a four instruction per cycle processor that

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.130
resolves branches in the 11th stage. After we gave fetched this branch,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.910
we have fetched a lot of instructions. After we fetch the branch, we fetched

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.660
four instructions in the next cycle, and four instructions in the next cycle. So

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.110
now when we miss predict a branch we waste 40 instructions that we

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.220
could have done if the prediction was correct. So the cost of a mis-prediction

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.760
is higher in terms of instructions that we have just wasted. And

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.730
that means that again it's much more important to predict branches correctly.
