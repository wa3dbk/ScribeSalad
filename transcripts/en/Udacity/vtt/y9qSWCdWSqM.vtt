00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.620
Let's say you want to write a program
that wishes your cat a happy birthday.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.480
If you tried to run this code,
you probably go this ugly error message.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.980
No worries, let's search for it.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.900
Man, it says no results found.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.710
So I guess I can't fix the problem.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.630
Just kidding.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.980
Let's try searching more effectively.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.675
The first part of the error message
tells you the name of the file,

00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:33.940
birthday.rb, the line number where
the error might be, which is line 2,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.990
and the name of the method that the
error might be in, say_happy_birthday.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.980
This information is useful for helping
you pinpoint where the error message is,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.830
but searching for these things won't
help, since everyone's specific file and

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.830
method names will be different.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.470
Not everyone will call
their file birthday.rb.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.020
Here's the more useful information.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.980
Undefined local variable or
method and NameError.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.610
These words and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.300
phrases describe the error rather
than the happy birthday program.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's try searching for these keywords.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.580
Nice, a lot of search results.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.800
There are a couple Stack Overflow posts,
a link to the Ruby docs, and a tutorial.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.095
Let's look at the official
documentation first.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:23.360
Hm.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.140
Depending on how much background
knowledge you have, this may or

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.010
may not mean much to you.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.200
The language is very technical and
it doesn't really explain how to fix it.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.700
Let's go back.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.855
How about we try this tutorial instead?

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:38.600
Hm.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.810
I think we found what we're looking for.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.960
It's telling us that we use
the variable, in this case,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.260
birthday, without assigning
it to a value first.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.083
So let's go do it.

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.697
And we could re-run the program.

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:54.502
Nice, it works.
