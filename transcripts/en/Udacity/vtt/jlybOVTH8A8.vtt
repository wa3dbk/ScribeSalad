00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.336
This can be a hard problem to think about, I got the axis wrong myself when I

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:08.976
was first making up this quiz, drawing sketches helps. Remember that a vector

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:14.092
rotating around an axis forms a circle. The cylinders axis on the y axis and the

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:18.494
final axis thru the corner of the cube define a circle whose center is at the

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:23.097
origin. If you think about continuing this arc the whole way, it becomes pretty

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:27.325
clear you're cutting the cube in half diagonally when viewed from above. We can

00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:31.485
also see that the axis through this circle is going to point in this direction

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:35.885
or the opposite direction in order to be perpendicular to this slice. Since the

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:39.637
y axis is in this slicing plane, there won't be any y component in the

00:00:39.637 --> 00:00:44.713
coordinates for the axis of rotation itself. So this axis must be either x

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:50.410
positive and z negative or x negative and z positive. For this reason the second

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.556
answer is correct. Negative x z is the axis. There can only be one plane that

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:59.216
contains the circle and there is only one axis direction or its opposite

00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:03.743
direction that is perpendicular to this plane. Therefore there is only one axis

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:07.460
of rotation that will take us from our starting position to the corner of the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.504
cube. So we can rule out all three of the other answers.
