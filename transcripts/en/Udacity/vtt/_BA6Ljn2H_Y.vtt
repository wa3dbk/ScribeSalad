00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer happens to be 0.7,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the reason is we can see that there is a positive correlation between x and y.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It is not a 1. That would mean there would be no spread on the data.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
They'd all line up nicely on the line.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But there is spread around this data, so it can't be 1.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's not zero, because there would be no correlation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's not negative, because the line doesn't go down. It goes up.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So, 0.7 is the best guess for the correlation.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's always good to look at the data and guess it in advance,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because then you can see if your math is actually correct.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's dive in and calculate the actual correlation.
