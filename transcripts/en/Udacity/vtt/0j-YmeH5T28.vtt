00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.199
And my question to you is, so this 1 + K over n-2k may look a bit strange,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.932
but is this here actually a useful approximation factor? And I'm going to give you four choices here.

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.499
So it might be that, because this is a very general question about general graphs,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.966
and this also looks a bit complicated, that it's not possible to say at this moment if this is a useful approximation factor.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:24.966
It might also be that this is a useful approximation factor, but only if the independent set

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:29.432
of the graph that we're given is very large. So it's a majority of the vertices.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:36.966
Or could it be that it is a useful approximation algorithm if N is very large, because N is in the denominator down here.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:42.866
Or is it just simply not a useful approximation factor? So please select the one here that you think is correct,

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:44.267
and then let's discuss.
