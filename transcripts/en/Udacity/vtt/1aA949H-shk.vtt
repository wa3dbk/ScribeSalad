00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.180
All right, enough theory,
I want to see some command line action.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.100
Not so fast, you might say.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.970
Don't we have to install Gradle first?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.010
Not at all.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.290
Gradle's first trick is that it
knows how to install itself.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.120
All it needs is a shell script, and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.510
a tiny jar that knows just enough
to download and install Gradle.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.530
I have in this directory,
a copy of the Gradle wrapper.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.020
Gradle wrapper consists
of just a shell script,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.100
we've got one for a Mac and
Linux and we've got one for

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.790
Windows, and then inside the Gradle
directory you have a tiny jar.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.100
The way the Gradle wrapper works is
you call it with a Gradle command,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.130
it'll check to see if
Gradle is installed.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.210
If it is it'll just
pass along a command,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.130
if it isn't the Gradle wrapper will go
ahead and download Gradle for you first.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.300
Let's go ahead and run the Gradle
Shell Script and see what happens.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.360
We didn't already have Gradle
installed so now it's downloading it.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.010
You see a lot of dots.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.270
Even more dots.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.680
All right.
There we go.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.720
Gradle's been downloaded.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.370
Welcome to Gradle 2.3.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.850
Hm, it looks like Gradle
decided we need some help.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.210
This option to see a list of
all available tasks looks good.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.790
Let's try running this.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.480
So let's try running the tasks
command using the Gradle wrapper.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.880
Whoa, that's a whole lot of tasks
that Gradle already knows about.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.550
And as we scan through
all of these tasks,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.110
looks like there's a task
that's calling out to us.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.820
Let's give this one a try.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.300
Now let's use the Gradle
wrapper to run the hello task.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.190
Along with some diagnostic output,
we get a nice greeting.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.690
How sweet.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.770
Gradle has to do a significant
amount of work to start up.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.350
Mainly because it's required to spin up
an instance of the Java virtual machine.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.240
This startup time can be mitigated by
using the Gradle Demon, a demon is just

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.760
a process that hangs around in
the background of your operating system,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.680
doing something useful.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.250
When Gradle's instructed to use a demon,
a demon process has started, and

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.080
continuously runs in the background,
keeping the JBM instance alive, so

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.170
that subsequent Gradle runs
can use the same instance.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.270
By default, Android Studio always uses
this as Gradle demon, when running

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.990
Gradle from the command line however
you'll have to explicitly enable it.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.996
Simply put you should always
use a demon when possible.

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:07.440
By using the demon you can take
advantage of huge performance benefits

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.860
that are planned to get even better
in future versions of Gradle.
