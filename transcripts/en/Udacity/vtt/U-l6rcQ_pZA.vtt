Computer science is a highly collaborative study, especially when you're

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.880
looking at the working world. Everyone works together to pull out and put

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.560
together this beautiful product. Let's look at Facebook and let's look at

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.290
Google. You're going to see thousands of programmers sitting in different

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.535
rooms, coding and sharing their ideas as well as lots of people coming in who

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:26.530
want to enhance your idea. Or perhaps change your idea. And you're not always

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.290
going to be able to be there to explain it. So documenting your code is really,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.850
really important to be able to work as a very fast paced efficient team, and to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.240
make impact on the products that you work on very quickly.
