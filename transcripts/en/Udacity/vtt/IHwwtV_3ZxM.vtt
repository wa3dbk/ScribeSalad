00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.026
Now, we're almost to an equation that can be factored. We just need to

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:08.658
rearrange the terms, so all of the terms are on one side of the equation. If

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:12.316
all the terms are on one side of the equation, that means the other side must

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:17.390
equal 0. What I want you to do is to rearrange the equation so that happens.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.951
What do you think we'll get here?
