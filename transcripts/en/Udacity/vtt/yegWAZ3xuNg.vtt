00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.350
Now, let's see what happens in a typical

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.430
parallel program. In a typical parallel program that you

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.910
might write, you probably get a lock, and you

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.390
have, mentally, an association between that lock and the

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.140
data structures that are governed by that lock.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.520
Or in other words, in writing your parallel program,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.490
you decided that access to variables a and b

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.660
are governed by this lock. So if I wanted

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.580
to read or write variables a and b, I'll

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.090
get a lock and then I will mess with the

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.700
variables that are governed by this lock. Once I'm

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.050
done with whatever I want to do with these shared variables,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.340
I'll unlock indicating that I'm done. And this is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.950
my critical section. So within the critical section, and we're

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.620
allowed to do whatever I want on these data

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.760
structures that are governed by this particular lock, because that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
is an association I as the programmer has made

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.370
in writing the parallel program. So if another processor

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.550
let's say P2 gets the same lock. It's going

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.420
to get the lock only after I release it. So

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.000
only after I release the lock, this guy can

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.270
get this lock because the semantics of the lock, it

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.670
is a mutually exclusive lock. And therefore, only one

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.840
person can have the lock at a time. And consequently,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.460
if you look at the structure of this critical section

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.960
for P2, it gets a lock. And it is messing

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.110
with the same set of data structures that I was

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.610
messing with, over here. But, by design, we know that either

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.100
P1 or P2 can be messing with the data structure

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.650
at any point of time. And that's a guarantee that

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.720
I know comes from the fact that I designed the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.860
pilot program. And the lock is associated with these data structures.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.250
So, in other words, p2 is not going to access any of the data that, that

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.500
is inside this critical section until p1 releases the lock. We know this because

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.590
we designed this program, but the sc

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.260
memory model does not know about the association

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.650
between these data structures and this lock.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.460
And, in particular, doesn't even know that memory

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.480
accesses emanating from the processor due to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.540
this lock primitive is a different animal compared

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.320
to the memory accesses coming from the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.400
processor as a result of accessing normal data

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.750
structures. So the cash coherence mechanism that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.850
is provided by the system for implementing the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.780
memory consistency model is going to be doing

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.980
more work than it needs to do because

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.140
it's going to be taking actions on every

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.480
one of these accesses, even though the coherence

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.110
actions are not warranted for these guys until

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.070
I release the lock. So what that means

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.500
is that there's going to be more overhead for

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.920
maintaining the coherence [UNKNOWN] with the SC memory

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.860
model, which means it's going to lead to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.173
a poorer scalability of the shared memory system.

00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:02.930
So in this particular example since P2 is not

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.880
going to access any of these data structures until P1

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.750
has released the lock there's no need for coherence action

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.040
for a and b until the lock is actually released.
