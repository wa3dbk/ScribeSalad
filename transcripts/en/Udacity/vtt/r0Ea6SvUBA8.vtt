Beyond the app servers, we had our database.

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, we just talked about how funky a database
setup we had, but it was still Postgres,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we'll still use the industry-standard
cylinders for representing our databases,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we had a couple of verticals--
I think we stored links on one,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
votes on another, comments were on one,
and then we had like a miscellaneous one.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Did we store subreddits and users on
the same one or something like that?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Subreddits were with comments,
users were with links.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.169
When we first built the system,
it was all on one machine,

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:41.000
and we had different tables for each data type.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And so a natural way to grow was
to split apart the data types,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.630
because remember, I talked about how
if you don't do joins, scaling is a lot easier--

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.000
This is an example of that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You have to think a little bit harder about
what your queries are going to be,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but you can start splitting things apart.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You know how many comments are
in the comment's database now?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Something in the order of like 250 million.
&gt;&gt;250 million comments.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When I left, I don't remember how many.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There was a lot and it wasn't fitting
on one machine with links.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.292
All these databases were replicated.
We used Londiste, I think.

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:26.000
Do you guys still use Londiste? Yes we do.
Londiste is a third-party tool made by Skype.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.215
Basically what this does is--
I think it is a log shipping right?

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:36.000
No, so when you write to the master, it hits
a trigger, which then inserts the same query

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
into a queue and that's replicated to all the slaves.
The same inserts will run all the slaves.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Okay. So, it just actually replays
the exact commands

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Yes. Obviously, things like random
get precalculated.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Okay. So all these machines were replicated
using Londiste, and Londiste is really cool,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and it might be a Londis-te, I don't know.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's a problem with web technologies is right, you
read about the technology, like I don't know.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Some people I think called this HAProxy,
but it's the first guy in the office

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
who discovers the piece of technology, he gets this is
how it pronounced for the rest of the company.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We replicate all of this machines both for durability,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and also if we lost the machine,
we wouldn't lose our data.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
In Reddit, if we lost your comment
history, you'd be mad.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.692
And for load, which spread our
reads across all these machines.

00:02:24.692 --> 00:02:29.000
Now, remember we talked about replication lag,
and I learned this lesson the hard way

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and it was really hard for me to figure out
the first time because I've never heard

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of replication lag, and we had to
really subtle bugs as a result.
