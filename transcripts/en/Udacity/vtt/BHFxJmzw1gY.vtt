00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.868
Let's do this thing. So, we'll go to cell A2, Command, Shift, Right arrow key,

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:13.350
Command, Shift Down arrow key, highlighting all the data. Data, Sort range,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.697
Sort by column B. And even though it says A to Z, that also applies for

00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:26.820
numbers, from least to greatest. Ascending rather than descending, and then

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.678
Sort. And now, we have all our data sorted. Note that it starts in cell B2 and

00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:42.783
goes to B28. Meaning, there are 27 values that we're interested in. And that

00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:49.500
means our median is going to be this one, 479. With 479, we have 13 values

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.922
greater, and that's because we're going from cell 16, B16 until B28. So, we can

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:06.530
find that number of cells by just doing 28 minus 16 plus 1, that gives us 13.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:16.500
And there are 13 values below 479. And likewise, we can do 14 minus 2 plus 1,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.432
which gives us 13. So, here's our median in the 14th place. It says 15 here,

00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:32.563
but that's because the data starts at cell 2. So, this is the 14th value.
