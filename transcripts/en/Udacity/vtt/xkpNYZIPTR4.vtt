00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.450
So how do we implement
reusable barriers correctly?

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.530
This is how.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.140
The idea here is that the value for

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.300
releasing the barrier will not be the
same for all instances of the barrier.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.090
Even instances when
release becomes zero,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.550
all instances are going to
release when release becomes one.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.740
So the idea is that we never really
need to reinitialize the release.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.640
We just flip the release.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.900
Each thread now has a localSense,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.500
which is kind of what's the release
that we should get in order to get out?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.160
So if we have 2 threads, 0 and 1,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.530
let's say that they started
with localSense being 0.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.990
Now they're going to get here and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.530
they're both going to figure
out that the localSense is 1.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.300
localSense is local to each thread, so

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.900
each of them just sets a local
variable independently.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.460
So, this is not going to
interfere with each other.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.340
Now, one of the thread will enter
the counter lock, increment the count,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.870
and here if the count is equal to the
total, they will reset the count, and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.650
set the release to localSense.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.840
So it sets the release to
what we are waiting for,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.840
in this case,
let's say thread one releases it to one.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.620
That means that thread 0,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.590
when it incremented account, didn't
see the total at 2, it saw it at 1,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.320
and proceeded to exit here and
enters this wait here.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.840
It's waiting now for

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.880
the release to become what it
thinks localSense is which is 1.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.270
So it's going to spin until
somebody puts 1 into the release.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.220
Eventually, thread 1 does that.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.650
So now let's say that
thread 0 is stuck here,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.740
that was the problem with the previous
implementation of the barrier.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.110
Let's say that we just
don't read it fast enough.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.360
So we want to see a 1, but
we don't check it fast enough.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.750
Thread 1, now, proceeds to exit,
finishes the work and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.950
comes back to the second
instance of the barrier.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.569
It now flips its own localSense to 0.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.171
Increments that count to 1,
because we reset the count when we were

00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:10.934
releasing the first instance,
checks the count, sees that it is 1,

00:02:10.934 --> 00:02:15.800
doesn't do this, unlocks the lock,
and enters the spin here.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.128
But thread 1 is now checking
whether the release has become 0,

00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:22.626
because it flipped the localSense.

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:26.254
Now it's waiting for this value for
the release, so they're waiting for

00:02:26.254 --> 00:02:28.100
different value.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.000
Note that the release is still the same

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240
as thread 1 left it in
the first instance.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.880
So eventually thread 0 will check and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.925
see that the release has become 1,
at which point it will leave.

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:44.700
Eventually it's going to come here,
change its local sense to 0,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.990
increment the count,
see that it's 2, reset the count,

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.970
set the release to 0 this time,
and now thread 1 will be released.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.750
So by flipping the value of the release
instead of reinitializing it in each

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.340
iteration of the loop,
we avoid the problem that we had.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.880
So this barrier is reusable.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.840
We can synchronize on
the same barrier over and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.570
over without risking
that lock situations.
