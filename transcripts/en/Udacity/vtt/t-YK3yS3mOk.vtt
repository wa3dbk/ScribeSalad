00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.600
So as we have discussed before, camera is basically, is trying to

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.700
capture a 2D view of a 3D world, to an essence, it's a window into a 3D world.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.350
But of course, in the case of the, camera, the world is 3D, so here for

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.040
example, the train tracks kind of give you a sense that as you go further away

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.110
things are getting smaller and smaller, gives you concept of perspective.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.530
In this case, by just not looking at that side but

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.300
just looking at this side, I get less sense of perspective, same image but

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.500
just moved on to the side and showing the train tracks.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.670
This is an important part again, how viewpoints and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.980
field of view play into photography.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.290
So imagine this is my subject, and my camera is here, I'm focused on

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.570
the subject except now this is my field of view from an 85 millimeter lens.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.740
I can move closer, use a 50 millimeter lens and

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.880
still capture approximately the same details of the same subject.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.520
I can move even closer, and use now a 20 millimeter lens and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.620
actually have approximately the same field of view, but

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.970
I really kind of moved up a little bit.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.611
We will see how this impacts our scenes, that we want to capture also.
