00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me do a final quiz. This is related to playing golf.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have a normal distribution with µ and σ² from which we draw A.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We do the same with B using the same µ and σ². Now we combine A+B and you just add them up.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now I would like to know how the new µ and the new σ² looks like.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And as before, I give you a number of possibilities.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So there are seven options in total from 2µ all the way to 0.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Please put your green number into these fields over here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So this will be a number within 1 and 7,

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and it indicates that the corresponding term is the correct answer for µ‘  and σ‘².
