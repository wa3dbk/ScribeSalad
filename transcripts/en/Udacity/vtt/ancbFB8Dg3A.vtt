00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.786
&gt;&gt; In addition to that atlas we have, we also have a very large and very complex

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:09.733
data file. This data file represents how the atlas should be rendered to draw

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:14.505
the entire map. Now this is a pretty complex file because its actually been

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.337
generated by an external tool, called tile. Prior to running the game, and

00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:24.063
artist would take our atlas data and the tile tool. For grids, we actually read

00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:27.969
the exported JSON data into our game, which tells us how to render the images

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.906
and the tiles on the screen. Now, in order to actually render our map, we need

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:36.014
to parse the exported data file that we've been given from the tiled editor. The

00:00:36.014 --> 00:00:39.977
data the we extract from this will tell us a number of things. First off, what

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:44.045
atlases to load. And secondly, how the layers are organized, given to us by the

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:48.196
artist. For example, you can see that the data layer here actually references

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:51.883
what tiles to render, as well as the height and the name of the layer itself.

00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:55.665
We'll need to be able to scrape all this and properly understand how it's laid

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.144
out to render our final image.
