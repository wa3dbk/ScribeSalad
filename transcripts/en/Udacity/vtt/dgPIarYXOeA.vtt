00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.419
In order to solve this quadratic inequality we need to first factor. When we

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.726
factor we get that quantities x plus 2 and x minus 1 are less than or equal to

00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:16.259
0. This gives us our critical points of x equal negative 2 and x equals 1. So if

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:21.654
you look over here at our number line, we have our number line with the critical

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:26.996
points on it, and we will begin to look at which intervals are true or false. So

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:32.070
now you can see we have 3 intervals. We have an interval from negative infinity

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.809
to negative 2, from negative 2 to 1, and from 1 to infinity. So if we pick a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.975
point in each interval and check to see if it's true, we'll find out where out

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:47.357
solution set lies. So, let's check in our first interval, negative infinity to

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:52.049
negative 2. Let's select the point negative 3. So we select negative 3 in

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:57.198
interval negative infinity to negative 2. You can see we obtain the solution of

00:00:57.198 --> 00:01:02.889
4, 4 is not in the interval negative infinity to negative 2. So we selected

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:09.693
three points, let's look at x equals -3 first, when we substitute that in, we

00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:14.795
get 4. Is less than or equal to 0 which is not a true statement. The second

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:19.261
point we select is 0 we get negative 2 is less than or equal to 0 we can see

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:23.989
that, that is a true statement. And the last point we selected 2 when we

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:29.235
substitute that in we get 4 is less than or equal to 0 which is also not a true

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:35.222
statement. So our solution lies between negative 2 and 1, including both of

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:41.287
those points. Our solution is negative 2 is less than or equal to x, which is

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:43.185
less than or equal to 1.
