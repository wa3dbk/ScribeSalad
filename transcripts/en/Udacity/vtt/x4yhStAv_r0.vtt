00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.620
Let us look at the meaning of the sentence, Ashok ate a frog.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.780
When I say the sentence, you understand its meaning immediately. But

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.150
what did you understand? What is the meaning, of the meaning, of the sentence?

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.460
How can I capture that meaning? How we capture it in a machine? Let us focus for

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.600
now, on the verb in the sentence, which is ate. We'll associate a frame.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.980
With the verb in the sentence. Later on we will see that frames can

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.040
also be associated with the objects or the nouns in the sentence, but for

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.622
now we will focus on the verb. Now what is it that we know about

00:00:37.622 --> 00:00:42.170
the stereotypical action of eating? What happens when people eat, when you and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.420
I eat? Usually there is an agent, that does the eating. And that particular

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.650
agent that corresponded the subject of the sentence. Usually something is being

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.911
eaten, that's the object. There is often a location where the eating is done or

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:59.960
the time when the eating is being done. Someone might use a, utensil to

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.269
do the eating. You might eat with a fork or a spoon for example. There might be

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.250
other things that we know about the stereotypical action of eating. For example,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.290
what is being eaten typically is not alive. At least not when humans eat it.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.620
Now this vertical slot object-is, this concerns the location of the object.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.120
Where is the object after it has been eaten? And you might say well,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.280
it's inside the subject's body. What might be the mood of the subject? Well,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.910
after people have eaten, typically they are happier. So, here is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.760
a list of slots that we associate with the stereotypical action of eating.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.140
This is not an exhaustive list, you can add some more. So each of the slots may

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.500
take some values. We'll call these values fillers. So slots and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.221
fillers. Some of the fillers are here by default.

00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:56.050
Some of the fillers may come from. Parsing the sentence. So, we know that

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.750
in this particular sentence, the subject is Ashok and the object is a frog.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.730
Okay so, frame then, is a knowledge structure. Note the word structure.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.560
There are, a number of things happening in this knowledge representation.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.050
If I may take an analogy with something, with which I'm sure you are familiar.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.480
Consider the difference between an atom of knowledge representation, and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.190
a molecule of knowledge representation. Some knowledge representations are like

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.050
atoms, other knowledge representations are like molecules.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.670
An atom is a unit by itself, a production rule is like an atom.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.000
On the other hand, frames are like molecules, they have a structure.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.979
There are a large number of things happening. These molecules could expand or

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:46.100
could contract. You can do a lot more with frames, that you can do with a simple

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.450
production rule. So frame isn't like a knowledge structure, which has slots, and

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.160
which has fillers that go with it. Some of these fillers, are by default.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.440
A frame deals with the stereotypical situation. Consider now a different

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.350
sentence. Suppose we had the sentence, David ate a pizza at home. Now here,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.690
I have filled out what a frame for this particular sentence would look like.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.630
The subject is different, the object is different. This time,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.780
there is some information about location, in the previous sentence there was no

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.840
information about location. Let us compare these two frames for another second.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.240
Note that these slots. In case of both the frames are exactly the same, because

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.230
the frame corresponds to the action of eating. The fillers on the other hand

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.396
are different, at least some of the fillers are different, because these fillers

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:39.090
corresponded the various input sentences. The only fillers that are the same,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.670
are those fillers which have to do with default values for particular slots.
