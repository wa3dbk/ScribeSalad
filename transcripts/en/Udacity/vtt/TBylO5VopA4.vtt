00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.086
What we usually care about when we analyze programs

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:06.770
is what's called the worst-case execution time. And that's the

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.930
case where the input for a given size takes

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.060
the longest possible time to run. So for our lookup,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.560
the worst case will be either the very last

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.690
entry in the table, or a keyword that doesn't exist

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.690
in the table at all. Let's look at the

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.540
code for lookup to understand more why the time scales

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.080
the way it does, and think about what the worst case

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.430
execution time and what the average case will be. So, to get

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.900
a better understanding of the results we've seen, let's look at the

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.320
codes that we wrote for the index. This is the code that

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.770
we finished in the last unit. And we have the code for

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.250
lookup. So, what lookup is doing, it's going through a loop. Each

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.737
of the entries in the index. And remember that index is a

00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:50.513
list, so it's going through that list for each element, it's checking,

00:00:50.513 --> 00:00:53.115
does it match the keyword. So this is our index structure,

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.930
right? It's a list of elements. If we had 10 million

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.540
of them, it's a very long list with lots of elements.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.924
But each element is a list itself, where we have keyword

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:07.205
followed by the list of URLS where it appears. And what

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:10.550
lookup is doing is going through those entries. The number of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.650
times we go through this loop depends on the size of

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.800
the index. The size of the index is the maximum number

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.474
of times through that loop. And it also depends on,

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:21.875
well, if we find the keyword early, then we're done.

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.620
The other code that you see here, that's relevant to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.490
this, is the code for add_to_index. And the reason that's relevant

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880
is, we want to know what the structure with index is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.220
after we make our big index. And what add_to_index does is

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.770
also loop through all the entries to find if one

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.060
already exists, then it adds that URL. If one doesn't exists,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.210
it adds the new entry at the end. So this means

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.280
that the first entry we add will always be at the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.310
beginning. That's why the aaaa, with eight a's is first. And

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.110
the last one that we add will be at the end.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.910
So now, we'll have a quiz to see if you understand

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.120
what it means to be the worst case input and how

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.040
the code for lookup works. The question is, which of these

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.850
inputs will have the worst case running time? So the choices are,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.280
doing lookup, passing in the index and the first word that

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.900
was added to the index. The second choice is doing lookup,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.470
passing in the index, and a word that is not in the index. And the third choice

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.230
is calling lookup, passing in the index, and is the second

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.300
input passing in the last word that was added to the index. So, for

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.350
the quiz, you should check all the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.030
answers that have the worst case running time.
