00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.380
In this lecture, we will talk about the

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.530
Internet's original design principles. These design principles were

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.720
discussed in the paper reading for today, the

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.410
Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols, by

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.970
Dave Clark, dated 1988. The paper has many

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.820
important lessons and we will go through many

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.490
of them as we revisit many of the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.280
design decisions. Before we jump into any details

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.860
let's talk about some of the high level lessons. One

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.950
of the most important conceptual lessons is that the design

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.100
principles and priorities were designed for a certain type of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.700
network. And as the internet evolves, we are feeling some of

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.370
the growing pains of some of those choices. In the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.020
last lesson. We talked about a number of the problems

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.090
and growing pains of the internet. And it's worth bearing

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.400
in mind that many of the problems that we are seeing

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.860
now, are a result of some of the original

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.330
design choices. Now that's not to say that some of

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.910
these design choices are right or wrong, but rather that

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.190
they simply reflect the nature of our understanding at the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.319
time as well as, the environment and constraints that

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.010
the designers faced for the particular network that existed at

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.430
that time. Now needless to say, some of the technical

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.630
lessons. From the original design have turned out to be

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.730
fairly timeless. One concept is packet switching, which we

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.370
will discuss in this lesson. And another is the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.790
notion of fate sharing, or soft state, which we

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.300
will discuss in a subsequent lesson in the course.
