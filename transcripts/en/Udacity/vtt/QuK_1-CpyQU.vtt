We know that 40 is equal to 4 times 10. So, we can replace the number under the

00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:08.389
radical with that expression instead. We know that this radical sign here

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.912
represents a 1 half power outside this entire expression. So, the radical sign

00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:17.166
itself should just distribute to the factors inside this term. That means, we

00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:21.485
can write that this is equal to the square root of 4 times the square root of

00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:25.845
10. The square root of 4 is just 2. And if we factorize 10, we see that it's

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:30.415
just equal to 5 times 2. These are the prime factors of 10. Neither of these is

00:00:30.427 --> 00:00:34.700
a square. So , that means that we can just leave the square root of 10 as the

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:38.675
square root of 10. This is the simplest form of the square root of 40.
