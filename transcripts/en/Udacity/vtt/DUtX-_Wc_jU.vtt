My name is Kylie. I'm a junior at Stanford studying Symbolic Systems, which I

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.890
joke is CS with a social life. It's computer science with philosophy,

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.080
psychology, linguistics, and communications. I came into school thinking that I

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.400
wanted to do public policy because I wanted to change the world. And then, I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.410
had a realization that, why do I have to do that with politics when I could do

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.360
it with technology? But I still needed that push. my brother, who's a

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.930
developer, told me he would disown me if I didn't take and enter the computer

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.880
science class. And so, I took it and I was immediately hooked.
