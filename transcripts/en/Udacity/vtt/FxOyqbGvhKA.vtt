00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.620
All right,
we've learned a lot in this lesson.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.240
Let's take a quick recap before
we move on to the last exercise.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.580
We covered what ARIA does
to the accessibility tree.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.210
Essentially, ARIA allows you to
intervene and do some tree surgery

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.820
before the accessibility tree is
exposed to assistive technology.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.400
&gt;From changing the role name or
properties of a single element

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.180
through to actually removing or
moving parts of the tree route.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.430
We talked about how to use the role
attribute to modify the role

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.790
of a single element.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.070
We saw how to use the ARIA spec to find
information about roles and attributes.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.520
For example, we can use the ARIA
spec to find a specific role

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.670
then dive down into the detailed
information for that role, to

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.200
learn about what attributes it supports
and what default semantics it may have.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.220
Similarly, we can find information
about particular aria properties.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.645
We learnt how to use ARIA
extended labeling options.

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:55.490
Aria-label, to provide a screen
reader only label string.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.380
Aria-labeledby, to refer to some
visible element as a label.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.470
And aria-describedby, to provide some
extra information alongside the label.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.700
We looked at the way ARIA can
specify semantic relationships

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.868
beyond the labeledby and
describedby relationships.

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:14.710
Such as aria-owns to modify
the shape of the accessibility tree.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.230
We examine the default semantics
of native HTML elements, and so

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.950
that some of those semantics may
not be overridden with ARIA.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.560
We learned that ARIA has
a set of landmark and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.640
document structure roles to help users
navigate and understand page structure.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.680
We looked at how to hide things
from assistive technology.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.330
Or show things only to
assistive technology.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.270
And lastly, we spent some time
exploring Aria-live regions.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.050
This is really only the very
basics of ARIA, but

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.620
it should be enough to help you
understand what ARIA can offer and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.430
how to read and understand the ARIA
documentation to learn more.
