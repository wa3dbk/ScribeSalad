00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.824
Converting is done by multiplying u and v by the number of texels in each

00:00:02.824 --> 00:00:07.423
direction, then dropping the fraction, not rounding. It's a similar process to

00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:11.163
how we converted from normalized device coordinates to window coordinates. For

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:18.466
example, u times 16 is 11.52, and we drop the fraction to get 11. V times 16

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:23.363
gives us 6.4. Again drop the fraction, and we get the answer 6.
