People sometimes talk about the head and heart, that is, cognition and emotion,

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:07.881
as being two different things. Some people are rational and some people are

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:12.255
emotional. Now, although there might be some value in separating thought and

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:17.144
emotion, we find that emotions can be very helpful for us, and adaptive. They

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:20.042
can be helpful when we need to solve problems, and they can help us adapt to an

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.440
environment.
