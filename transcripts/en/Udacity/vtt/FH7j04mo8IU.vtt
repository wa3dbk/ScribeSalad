00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.042
So, we eventually got to find the x-intercepts of this equation that we didn't

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.122
know how to factor, but this is a pretty long winded process. Unfortunately,

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:12.288
this is a situation that we actually run into quite a bit. It's really only very

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:16.529
special cases of quadratic equations that we can factor. Thankfully, there's a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.435
formula that we can use to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation so we

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:24.852
don't have to go through this long process every single time. Now, get excited,

00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:29.175
because you are going to work out that formula yourself. We're going to start

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:33.595
with the general form of a quadratic equation, ax squared plus bx plus c equals

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:37.609
0. And we're going to use this to solve for x. This might look a little bit

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.326
complicated at certain points but once you've gotten to the end and you

00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:45.295
understand why the formula we end up with works, you'll get to use this every

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.517
single time. Let's follow this same method as we did in the last example. First

00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:53.378
things first, let's complete the square. It might be a little bit messy but

00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:57.267
we're going in. The first thing I'd like you to do is to factor out a from these

00:00:57.267 --> 00:01:00.704
first two terms here. What belongs inside these parenthesis then?
