[MUSIC]

00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:23.495
All right, JP.

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:25.710
The developer just finished
up the validation rules.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.900
And I know that you've got
your flight to Hawaii, and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.000
I've got some rest and
relaxation to catch up on.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.780
So, I can finally close this
pesky rules file, right?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.760
&gt;&gt; Well, I mentioned authentication,
authorization, and validation.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.200
You've done two of three.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.160
&gt;&gt; JP, you're killing I me.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.620
More rules?

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.930
Then, I guess those validation
rules are pretty important, and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.010
the data is looking a lot cleaner.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.710
&gt;&gt; Right, and

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.010
remember none of the validation rules
are checked when something is deleted.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.550
Meaning someone could just delete the
whole database with some JavaScript and

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.800
also, what's the point of having
someone log in without validation?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.820
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay,
then I guess the developer and

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.489
I could read up a little
bit more on authorization.
