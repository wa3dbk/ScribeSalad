00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.053
So, recall that we just said that people respond differently to stress. And one

00:00:04.053 --> 00:00:07.551
of the things that determines this difference in how people respond to stress,

00:00:07.551 --> 00:00:13.477
is how positively or negatively they see the world. So, certainly you've all

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:18.208
heard the term optimist and pessimist. Now, the optimist, as the saying goes,

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:24.040
will see this glass as half full and the pessimist will see it as half empty.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.280
So, optimism is good, not just for our behavior, but for our minds and our

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.570
bodies as well. So, for instance, research has shown that optimists are less

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.750
likely to get depressed. They're better able to cope with their emotions, and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.310
they recover faster from, and cope better with stress. So, optimism is good for

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.790
our minds and our bodies.
