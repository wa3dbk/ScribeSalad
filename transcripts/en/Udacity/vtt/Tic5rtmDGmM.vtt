00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.517
So for the final question of homework 2

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:06.502
your goal is to define a procedure called print<u>_multiplication</u>_table

00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:09.866
and it takes as input a single positive whole number

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:13.884
and it prints out a multiplication table showing all the whole number multiplications

00:00:13.884 --> 00:00:16.100
up to and including the input number.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.000
So here is an example.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.844
If the input is the number 2 what you should print out is:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I hope I got all those right without using the interpreter.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
To be correct, you must print them out in the same order as we're showing here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There will be a longer example in the coments to make sure the order is clear.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They should match exactly this format as well.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is a pretty hard question, so it's worth a gold star.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Actually, I'm going to make it worth two gold stars.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
As a hint, one of the things you need to think about to do this question

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
is something that we haven't seen before,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but you've seen it for ifs.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We saw in the lecture to define biggest that we used one if inside another if.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
To solve this you're going to have to think about using a while inside another while.
