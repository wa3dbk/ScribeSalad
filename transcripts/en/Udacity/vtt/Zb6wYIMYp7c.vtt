00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.490
So here now is the, current concept definition of arch that the AI program has.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.270
Now, the teacher shows a new example, here is the new example shown. There

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.760
are three bricks, but the third brick here, is not on top of the first two.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.410
This is the input to the AI program with a third example. And the teacher tells,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.180
the AI program that this is not a positive example of an arch. So here is

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.940
a current concept definition. Here is a representation of the input example, and

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.890
information that this is a negative instance of the example.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.000
What may the AI program learn from it?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.710
The AI program must refine it's current definition of the arch, in such a way

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.820
that the, new negative example is ruled out. But how can we do that? One way

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.420
of doing that is to say, that, we will put extra conditions on these links.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.319
These support links must be there. These are not optional. We'll call it,

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.320
the require-link heuristic. This require-link heuristic says that,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.580
if the structure of the presentation of the concept and is structure of

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.400
the representation of the, negative example have some things in common.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.630
But there are also some differences. Then revise the current definition, in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.200
such a way that, those things that are not in common become, must be required.
