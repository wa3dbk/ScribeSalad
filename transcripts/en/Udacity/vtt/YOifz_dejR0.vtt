00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.485
And [unknown] that I'm not the only one that thinks regular expressions are

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:09.242
interesting and powerful, both West Weimer's 262 class and Peter Norwick's 212

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:13.715
class have entire units that are focused mostly on understanding and using

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:17.618
regular expressions. We're not going to go into that much depth now, but I'll

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:21.370
explain enough so you can understand basic regular expressions, including the

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.061
one that's used here. So, regular expressions define sets of strings. The

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:28.424
simplest is to just have a single character and that represents the set

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:32.656
containing just one string. So, for example, the regular expression A, defines a

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:36.649
set containing the single string just A. And I'm not writing my strings with

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.704
coats here or using Python set notation. I'm writing this in a more mathematical

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:44.996
way. We can also concatenate in. And if we have two regular expressions next to

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:49.150
each other, that gives us the set of everything we can get from R followed by

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.757
everything in S. This will make more sense when we have Rs and Ss that can

00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:59.530
produce many strings. If it's just a followed by b, well, a can produce just a,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.168
b can produce just b. So, give this a set containing the strings ab. We can put

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:08.524
multiple expressions within square braces like this and that produces a set of

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:12.748
strings which is the union of all the strings R can produce and all the strings

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:16.840
S can produce, so in this case this going to be a set of two elements containing

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.640
the strings a and b. We can use the asterisk, which means zero or more

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.011
occurrences of whatever precedes it. So, that would mean a star is the set of

00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:35.755
strings, the empty string, the string a, the string aa, the string aaa, and so

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:42.370
on. Aaaa, and aaaaa. If we wrote that in Python, it would just be two quotes

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.590
next to each other. Since I'm not using the quotes here, I'll just write empty.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.365
So a question mark is the set of two strings, either empty or the string a. The

00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:54.640
last thing that I need to mention is that we can use parenthesis for grouping.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.626
So, if you put parenthesis around two regular expressions, that becomes a single

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:08.050
expression, for example, if we had ab star that would be the set of strings a,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.263
ab, abb, ab bb and so on. But if we use the parenthesis and we have ab

00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:27.237
surrounded by parenthesis star, well that's going to be the set of strings

00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:33.680
empty, abb bb and so on. The other thing parenthesis do is bind what's in

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.162
between them as variables. And so, the first input to our query is what's

00:02:38.162 --> 00:02:40.863
contained in the first set of parenthesis.
