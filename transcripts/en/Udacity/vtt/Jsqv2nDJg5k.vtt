00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.820
If you've ever used Google Maps, you may
have noticed that not only can you zoom

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.780
down to street level, but you can
also see what the location looks like

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.440
as if you were standing
there looking around.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.290
This is called Street View.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.800
It's an incredible, immersive technology

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.510
that allows you to explore the world
without leaving your desk.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.390
If you think that's an exaggeration or
over marketing,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.940
here's an example of street view
that actually happened to me.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.440
As well as working for Google,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.790
I've authored a number of very popular
young adult science fiction novels.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.490
Two of the locations that I
have used in these novels

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.290
are the town of Shiprock in the Navajo
reservation in New Mexico, and

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.050
the town of Kawatana just
outside Nagasaki in Japan.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.910
I've never been to either place,
but I've gotten fan

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.880
mail from people who live in them asking
me to say hi the next time I'm in town.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.950
I did all of my location
research using Google Maps, and

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.470
in particular Google Street View.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.130
The great news as an android developer,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.980
is that all of this imagery is
available to you using Google's APIs.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.360
Let's take a look at a simple
street View application

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060
that allows you to
hike the Grand Canyon.
