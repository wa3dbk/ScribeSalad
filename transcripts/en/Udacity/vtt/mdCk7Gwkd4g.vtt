00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.650
Here're some things that I noticed. On the first

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.530
day of the month I see this huge bin of

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.870
almost 8,000 people. This seems really unusual since I

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.270
would expect most people to have the same number of

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.310
birthday's across every day of the month. Now this

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.480
would be true of course except for the 31st. Not

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880
all months have 31 days so the lower number

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.960
of people in this bin makes a lot of sense.
