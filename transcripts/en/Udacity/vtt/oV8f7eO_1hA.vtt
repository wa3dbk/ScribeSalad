00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.707
So, looking at these distributions how many standard deviations is my number of

00:00:05.707 --> 00:00:11.422
Facebook friends away from the mean number of Facebook friends. Remember that I

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:16.802
have 63 facebook friends. The mean number of facebook friends is 190 and the

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:22.525
standard deviation is 36. So how many standard deviations away am I?
