00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.340
So everybody will tell
hire the A players.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.730
Don't bring B players or A minus
players, and that's a no brainer.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.830
Everybody wants the A players.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.610
The whole thing is to get them,
especially when you're small.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.130
So let's say that you're a new company.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.140
You don't have any money at all, or

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.750
you are not even worth, you have half
a million or one million in funding.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.820
You supposed to be able to offer
something to your employees,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.970
but you know that you can't because
you have a that it's very limited.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.520
So you can offer all kinds of things.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.190
First of all,
you can offer stock options.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.650
That's, again, that's obvious.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.030
You can offer your first employees

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.530
options that hopefully will
get them rich very soon.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.483
Another thing that you can offer them
besides salary, is specific, sorry,

00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:56.130
another thing that you can
offer them is benefits.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.220
Some benefits will go a long way, like
health plans and subscriptions to gyms.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.950
It depends on where you live.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.739
If you live in San Francisco,
that's nothing.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.250
But if you live Midwest,
that's something else.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.710
It's more popular there.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.850
The most important thing
that a new company can offer

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.570
the employees is sense of purpose and
culture.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.150
Because if you have a good culture,
you have something special,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.119
you have that good vibe
going on in your office.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.360
It's worth more than
money to some people.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.200
People would like to go to work for

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.700
you because you give
them an experience back.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.420
You give them the option to work with
amazing people for a great company.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.900
They feel that they really contribute,
and

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.890
this is something that goes a long way.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.800
Another thing that you can offer your
new employees is to give them the option

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.380
to work with people they see as
important, as smarter than them,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.360
more experienced, people they can
actually learn something from.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.870
People that will help them get
more advanced in their career.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.190
They can learn from, they can build
something special with those people.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.020
And this is something that you
can't buy with money, okay.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.433
It's worth more than an extra 10 or
$20,000 a year.
