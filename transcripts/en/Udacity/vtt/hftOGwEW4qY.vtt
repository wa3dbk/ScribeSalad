00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this next question, we want to find all the hexamesters a given course is offered.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So if we go back to our data structure, what we're going to do

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is go through each hexamester, each key in the highest level dictionary,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
search through all the keys of that dictionary.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If they equal the course we're looking for, we're going to append it to a list of our results.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The first thing I do is create the result list,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and we're going to go through every key in courses to get each hexamester.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If that course is in the dictionary for that hexamester,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
then we're going to append it to our offered list.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And once we're finished, we're just going to return the list.
