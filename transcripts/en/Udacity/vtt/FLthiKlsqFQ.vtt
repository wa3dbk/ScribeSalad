00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Our next question from student, MTRTMK, from Pakistan.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This student asks, "What are some good programming practices,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and how important is it to follow programming practices

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
used by professionals--things related to like

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
naming variables, commenting the code,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
being consistent with the structure--things like that?"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So this is a great question.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There are definitely many things that people learn

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as they get more experienced in programming.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're focused, in this class, on learning the basic concepts--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
on getting you able to write and understand short programs.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm trying to use good practices in most of the programs

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and, hopefully, those will come across.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But people have different opinions about the right way to code things.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Some opinions are better than others.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I think, in most cases, the opinions that I have are reasonably good ones.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Most cases--not always. &gt;&gt;Most of the time--we hope.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And you'll develop your own style.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You'll develop your own experience

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
as you get more experience as a programmer--how you like to do things--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but there are conventions that it's useful to follow,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and part of the reason it's useful to follow conventions

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is you want it so other programmers can understand your code.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And things like using lower case names--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
using lower cased letters at the start of a variable name

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
are just conventions, and that's used to distinguish

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
variable names from other things you might see in a program.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There's no really good reason for that, but that's

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a convention that most programmers follow,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and it's good for you to follow it too so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
if other people need to read your code

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
they'll be able to the code as well.
