00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.680
One thing we can do to find the line of best fit, is to find the line that

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.960
minimizes the sum of all the residuals. The only problem is that the residuals

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.129
are either negative or positive. And so, if we add something like this, say.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.890
These negative and positive residuals. Would just balance each other out. We

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.950
could have a line of best fit that doesn't go through the points at all, but

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.560
still has a very small sum of the residuals. We're kind of in the same

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
situation where we were figuring out how to measure spread. We looked at

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.262
possibly the average absolute deviation then, from the mean. Similarly, we

00:00:41.262 --> 00:00:46.705
could look at the absolute residual. In other words, even if the residual is

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:52.260
negative, just look at the positive value. This is one method. But the standard

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.180
method is to minimize the sum of squared residuals. In other words, we'll

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.810
square all the residuals to get rid of the negative sign. Add up all these

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.580
squares. And then minimize this value. In symbols, this would be the observed y

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.020
value minus the expected y value. Which, you remember, was y hat. And this is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.990
the y value that corresponds to that x value. On this regression line squared.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.090
When we have a function, we can use calculus to find the maximum value and the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.120
minimum value. When we say value, we mean the x value. Where does the max or

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.150
min occur? In other words, at what x value? We can also use calculus to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.120
minimize this sum of squared residuals. And find out what our aggression

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.180
coefficients should be. When we use calculus, we get that our slope is equal to

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.540
this. This is a long tedious equation and you won't have to use it. It just so

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.940
happens that this is equal to r. Remember Pearson's correlation coefficient?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.980
Times the ratio of the standard deviation of the y values to the standard

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.090
deviation of the x values. Isn't that awesome? Let's use it to find the slope

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.570
our regression line for the airplane example.
