00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.621
So, you might have noticed that I
preemptively added a little Edit Name

00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:04.723
button in the Menu Bar.

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:07.905
If you click on it,
the Edit Name dialog pops up.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.697
Now that you know more about Firebase's
four write methods, can you add the code

00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:15.620
so that the app actually updates
the name of the Firebase shopping list?

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.240
Here, I'll show you what I mean.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.710
Right here is the Edit List
button that I was talking about.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.540
When you press it, it'll show a dialog.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.440
You should be able to type
the name in here, and

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.930
then press Edit Name to edit
the name of the shopping list.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.820
Shopping lists contain a few properties,
and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.400
right now the listName is the only one
that we're making directly editable.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.010
The name of the owner will not change.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.320
Right now the owners are all
named anonymous owner,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.040
which is rather ominous sounding, but

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.310
we'll worry about fixing that when we
add user accounts in the next version.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.070
Now the timestampLastChanged
property is interesting.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.710
It should update whenever we
change any part of the list, so

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.850
when we change the listName,
timestampLastChanged will be modified,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.550
but it won't be directly
modified by the user.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.620
So, when we change the listName,
timestampLastChanged should also change.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.230
It's worth noting that, in the future,
this area will contain a list of items

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.470
in the shopping list, but
that will come later in this version.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.290
Right now,
just focus on making the name and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.580
the timestamp change using the right
methods we just talked about.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.890
I'll send you a full spec right now.
