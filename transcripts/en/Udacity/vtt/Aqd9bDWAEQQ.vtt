00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.460
The biggest threat to Diffie-Hellman
key exchange is the so-called

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.090
bucket brigade attack.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.520
It is a kind of
man-in-the-middle attack.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.910
That is Trudy, the adversary,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.640
can intercept the message
you that Alice sends to Bob.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.580
And instead,
Trudy sends her own yx to Bob.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
And fooling Bob to accept this as you.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.270
Likewise, Trudy intercepts
Yb that Bob sends to Alice,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.050
and instead sends her own Yx to Alice.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.280
Fooling Alice to believe
that Yx is actually Yb.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.940
And the result is that the shared
key that Alice computes,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.940
is actually the shared key
between Alice and Trudy.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.320
And likewise,
the shared key that Bob computes,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.080
is actually the shared key
between Trudy and Bob.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.100
In other words, Trudy Plays Bob
to Alice, and Alice to Bob.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.019
This man in the middle attack is
possible because the Diffie–Hellman key

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.640
exchange protocol does not
authenticate Alice or Bob.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.830
For example, there's no way for

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.570
Alice to know that the message that
she receives is really from Bob.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.650
There are a number of ways to fix this.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.960
For example, everyone, for
example, Alice and Bob,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.990
can publish her or
his public key, you or Yx.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.620
That is, instead of having to send it
and risk interception and forgery,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.350
just publish you or
Yb at a public trusted site.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.850
Or, if Alice has already published her
RSA public key, she can signed you when

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.500
she sends it to Bob, so that Bob would
know that you is really from Alice.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.730
Because Bob can verify that
uses Alice's RSA public key.
