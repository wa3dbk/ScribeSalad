00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.130
Java was invented by a gentleman by the name of James Gosling at Sun. It was

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.350
originally called Oak, and it was intended for use with PDAs. Then when in

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.940
the 90s, there was a lot of interest in video on demand using the internet,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.606
Sun thought that Java maybe the right

00:00:20.606 --> 00:00:25.422
language for programming set-top boxes, but unfortunately the

00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:28.260
cable TV industry went with SGIF for the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.098
VOD trials, and so Oak fell flat at that

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:36.831
point. And Sun all but gave up on Oak then the World Wide Web caught on and Java

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.963
got a new life with the need for containment

00:00:39.963 --> 00:00:43.530
of what happens on the client boxes connecting to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.617
the World Wide Web. And today a lot of

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:52.250
internet e-commerce depend a lot on the Java framework.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.655
The intent in this lesson is not to talk about

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:58.370
the Java language itself but the distributed object model of Java.
