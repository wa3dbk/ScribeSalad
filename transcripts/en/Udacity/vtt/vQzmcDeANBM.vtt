00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.469
All right, it's time for
your first project.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.000
You'll write a bit of code here, but

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this is really an exercise in learning
to use the resources available to you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.235
You'll first solve some riddles to
escape the made-up land of RubyDocs, and

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.680
will then reflect on your experiences so
far and where you're going.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.860
This will be your first time interacting
with our project reviewers and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.830
experiencing the review process in full.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.780
So, let's get started.
