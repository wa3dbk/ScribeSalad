00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.910
For the first question, each translation matrix represents a vector, a movement.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.631
We can move an object by vector after vector and at the end of it, the object

00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:12.490
will have changed its location, nothing more. So we know the resulting

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.640
concatenated matrix is purely a translation matrix. So the answer is yes. With

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.031
scaling, each scale operation changes the dimensions of the object. Scale does

00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:26.850
not actually move or rotate the object. So a series of scales will result in a

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.503
scale matrix. So the answer here too is yes.
