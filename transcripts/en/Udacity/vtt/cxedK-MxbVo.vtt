00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.719
GCD provides us with
two types of queues.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:09.230
Serial, or synchronous queues, and
concurrent, or asynchronous queues.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.070
Serial queues behave
as explained earlier.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.470
Every closure gets to run when
it reaches the end of the queue.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.630
On the other hand, concurrent or
asynchronous queues have several threads

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.650
that pickup closures at any
point of the queue for running.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.905
These are harder to control and
we won't be using them.

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:31.790
An app can have several queues, but
not all queues are created equal.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.010
There is a very special
one called the main queue.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.510
This is the queue that handles
the UI of your app, as well as

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.210
any of your code that doesn't explicitly
ask to run in background queue.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.580
It is vital that you never run
code that blocks on this queue.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.180
What does it meant to block?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.800
Blocking is when your code takes a human
perceivable amount of time to execute,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.140
and prevents your app from
continuing until it's done.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.020
You can do this either by doing
something computationally expensive,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.780
such as applying a filter to a video,
or a big image.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.140
However, the most common way of
blocking is by using the network.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.740
Say you wrote some code to make
a network request on the main queue,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.860
then none of your UI could update
until the network request finishes.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.180
We cannot allow this to happen.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.600
If you do block the main queue,
your UI will be sluggish, and

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.230
your app will provide
a terrible user experience and

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.820
will likely be rejected
from the app store.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.050
We won't have any of that.
