00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's our map API. What we need to do is figure out how to draw this map.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The URL is going to look like this.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's going to be this URL--maps.googleapis.com/maps/apis/staticmap,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then it's going to have some parameters.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I've done a little research already to find that the only required parameters are size--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is going to be the size of the map, sensor--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
if we were doing this on a phone or in a browser that knows where you are already,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
whether to actually try to figure out where the user is.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're not going to use any of that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then we can just add these marker parameters.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here's one marker, and you can see in here this marker is defining the color to be blue,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and it has a label, and then, also, you can see something that looks like coordinates in here.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I've learned that the color and the label aren't required.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We can just say marker and given it the coordinates.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If you notice here there is another marker parameter.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The way this API works is it just looks from for multiple marker parameters.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We'll just add one marker parameter in the URL for each point that we have.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now we want to update our front page to actually have the art images.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Let's think about what we're going to do.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We're going to first find which arts have the coordinates.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If we have any arts with coordinates, then we need to display the image URL.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
First thing we need to do is we need to define which arts have coordinates. This is fairly easy.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What we can do is we're going to take this list of arts,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and for each one we're going to check to see if it has coordinates.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Let's say for a in arts: if arts.coords: points.append(a.coords).

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We have to define points as equal to the empty list. This is pretty straightforward.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
For a in arts--for each one of these--if there are coordinates--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The way the datastore works is if there are not coordinates in the database,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
this'll just be None. It won't blow up on us or anything. Just add it to the list points.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is a clear way of writing it. How I would have written it is slightly less clear.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
A little shorter. This is just some Python learning for your own edification.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Points = filter(None, (a.coords for a in arts)).

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This is a generator--a.coords for a in arts.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This would return an iterator of all the coordinates, which may be either coordinates or None.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Then filter takes two parameters.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It takes a function or None and a list or an iterable

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and basically returns all of the items in the list that match the filter.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In this case, if the filter is None, it basically says match all the ones that aren't None.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This will give us all of the coords for each a in art if it's not None.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That does exactly the same as this. We're going to use the slightly shorter version.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
This should work. Let's make sure this doesn't blow up on us.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Here we are in the browser. We reload the page, and we see our little guys.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Maybe we should print out the coordinates so we can see them.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's go ahead and do that. Okay, we're going to go ahead and write that out.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Let's try that in our browser. There we go.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
There's a list of our points, and in this case we only have one. That's good.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
There's one subtle bug I'd like to point out to you in this code.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Arts is a query. When we iterate over arts, that's when we actually run the query.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If we never iterated over arts here, this query wouldn’t run.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Well, we iterate over here, and then when we're rendering the front.html--

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
this template, if you recall, has a loop in it that draws all the arts.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
This also iterates over that arts query.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Each time we do that we run the query.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We don't want to run the query twice. That's wasteful.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Not only is it wasteful a query, the results of that query could change.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
When ever you find yourself in a situation of iterating over results you get from a database,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
whether it's datastore or some other kind of curser based abstraction from a database,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
it's usually good to say something like this: [arts = list(arts)]

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
What this does is it creates a new list out of that arts.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The arts that comes out of here is a curser, and then we basically call

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the list constructor on it, which says, okay, make a new list out of that iterable.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Then we can iterate over this list as many times as we want,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and we've kind of detached it from the query.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
This is a good habit to get into if you think you're going to be using results from a database

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
more than once or you're going to be manipulating this result from a database

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
too far away from this query,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
because generally if you get a list of things from an iterable,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
you assume that you can go over it a couple of times. That's all this is going to do.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It's basically going to cache the results of this query in a list.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's very subtle, and I was actually struggling a little bit how to demonstrate that to you.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I don't know how to debug Google queries.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
If I could have made this print in the console, I would have.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
If we figure that out between now and when we wrap this lesson up,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
we'll include that in the instructor comments how to show what queries are actually running.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
But I did a little googling and confirmed for myself that this would be the case.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
That's good to do.
