00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.170
The benefits that Taylor eluded to included, include the fact that what we have

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.730
done by documenting an architectural style is encode our experience on it.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.750
For example with the client server there are certain ways of, of dividing things

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.630
up and, and connecting them together. That, work better than other ways.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.920
We also know, with client server what kinds of problems can arise and,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.470
how we can best cope with those. And having that knowledge then allows us to,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920
reduce our overall development effort because we're not stumbling down

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.080
blind alleys. Architectural styles can also be encoded into Standards.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.720
Standard sometimes call reference architectures. And those Standards can then

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.920
support the validation process, the way that we check whether our architectural

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.460
solution is, is a good one. Architectural styles can also support Reuse.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.960
The fact that there are, all kinds of, client server.

00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:08.842
Systems out there means we maybe able to make use of standard

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:14.270
components such as [UNKNOWN] database server. And because different styles

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.600
provide different ways of, of structuring the development process, we may even,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.450
even be able to. Use the, the style to guide us in,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.370
in what our groups should look like and the steps that they should take

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.090
when validation can come and so on. What I'd like to do now is have a look at

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.859
some of the different architectural styles that have arisen over the years
