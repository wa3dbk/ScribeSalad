&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now can you see a pattern here? Something's going on. I want you to really

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.430
think about what the x-intercept and the y-intercept mean, and then complete

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.874
these sentences. For the x intercept the x or the y coordinate is always equal

00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:17.201
to what? And for the y intercept the x or the y coordinate is always equal to

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:21.565
what? So choose out of the x or y coordinate for each sentence and then choose

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:23.330
the number that it's equal to.
