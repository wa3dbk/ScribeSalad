00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.860
Now, in the past lectures, we have talked about file formats.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.760
We basically talked about file formats being nothing else but a data structure

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.230
that would actually store the intensities of each and every pixel in an image.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.460
But in some instances, someone might say, that's a lot of missing information,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.500
why don't we get a lot of information that's raw to the sensor and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.110
actually just save that.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.710
And that's behind the whole concept of a Camera RAW file format.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.920
Basically, what you do in a camera RAW file format, is basically,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.090
you store the minimally processed data from each and every part of the sensor.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.720
Each and every point that's measured light, you save the original or

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.150
as close to the original raw data from there.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.750
The images in a camera RAW format are encoded in a device-dependent color space.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.640
Sometimes, of course, it's a propriety color space.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.458
But each camera has a specific form of a color space.

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:01.530
And, what it basically does is, image is stored in that and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.720
after you save it the camera manufacturers do provide information on

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.280
how to take that color space and make it much more readable on a computer.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.210
More importantly, it also captures the radiometric characteristics of the scene.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.480
Radiometric basically meaning that the light and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.500
the intensities of the colors from the scene are captured in

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.300
a raw format rather than manipulated in any way whatsoever.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.240
Many of you who do advanced photography know that in some cameras,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.800
there is a lot of calibration tools that allow you to control the light and

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.230
also the colors very specific to the scene, sometimes by

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.730
doing white balancing or different types of color contrast and stuff like that.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.790
One of the beautiful things about camera RAW is, since it's capturing the raw

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.870
radiometric characteristics of the scene, you can do all of that after the fact.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.820
In essence what it does is basically let's you get the image from

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.150
the camera's sensor data.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.470
So the whole concept of a Camera RAW file format is,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.260
it's to kind of replicate the whole photographic negative.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.350
One of the things that went away when we started going from

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.400
film to digital images is, while we had the instant gratification of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.160
seeing the image as soon as it was captured, we basically got it processed,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.740
it was not something we could manipulate anymore.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.490
One of the beautiful things about doing dark room

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.030
photography was always that once the film was exposed,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.010
when you were sitting in a dark room, you could do a variety of

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.030
different ways of exposing that film to give you different contrast levels.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.400
Well, that now is possible through camera RAW format, because once you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.280
have the camera format with things like the radiometric characteristics and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.030
stuff like that, you could actually do a lot more.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.830
So in essence, one of the advantages of a camera RAW file format is

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.536
that they're minimally processed, device dependent, and therefore actually,

00:02:56.536 --> 00:03:00.890
you know, you know know more about how the perfect response for

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.766
that specific camera's devices.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:06.520
Oh. This, so it's device-dependent, so

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.100
basically, the colorspace is really known by the manufacturers, and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.280
therefore they allow you to read out the best values from it.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.068
Radiometrics, all the color values are well defined and captured raw.

00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:22.695
And of course, this represents an equivalence class to the form,

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:26.341
photographic negative, let's you control things after the fact.

00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.788
And it allows you to do things like changes in dynamic range, color, and

00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:32.970
most of the information of the captured image is available to you.
