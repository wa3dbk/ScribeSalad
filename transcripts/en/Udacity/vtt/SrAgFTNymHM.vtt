00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.720
Visuospatial reasoning is reasoning with visuospatial knowledge.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.060
This has two parts to it, visual and spatial. Visual deals with the what part.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.880
Spatial deals with the where part. So imagine a picture in

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.590
which there is a sun on the top right of the picture. There are two parts to it.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.840
Sun, the what, the object. And where, the top right of the picture.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.330
We have come across visuospatial reasoning a little bit when we use

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.840
constraint propagation to do line labeling and 2D images. One way of defining

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.360
visuospatial knowledge is to say that in visuospatial knowledge causality is,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.460
at most, implicit. Imagine a picture in which there is a cup with

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.290
a pool of water around it. You don't know where the pool of water came from.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.400
But you and I can quickly infer that the cup must have contained the water, and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.340
the water must have spilled out as the cup fell. So visuospatial knowledge,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.270
causality is implicit when it enables inferences about causality.
