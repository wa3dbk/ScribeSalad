00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.418
This was the factored form. Excellent work if you got that one correct. When we

00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:09.188
start to factor, we should always ask ourself, is there GCF. Each of these terms

00:00:09.188 --> 00:00:14.096
doesn't share an a, but they do share a 5. If we factor out a 5, we're left with

00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:19.372
this trinomial. We multiply a times c to get negative 45. And then we put

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:24.785
negative 4 in the bottom, the b term. We want to find factors of a times c that

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:30.740
sum to b. So we want to find factors of negative 45 that sum to negative 4. Here

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.370
are factor pairs for negative 45. I made the first factor negative, each of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.573
these sums would be positive so I need to make the second factors negative. 5

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:45.862
and negative 9 sum to negative 4. So this is what I use to rewrite negative 4a.

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:49.488
Remember it's best to put the negative coefficient first. It makes our factoring

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:54.081
more simple. We can factor 3a from the first two terms, and a positive 5 from

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:58.478
the second two terms. Finally we factor out an a minus 3 to give us this

00:00:58.478 --> 00:01:02.906
expression. And we don't actually need to include these brackets anymore since

00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:07.885
all we have between factors is multiplication. This is the complete factored

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:08.373
form.
