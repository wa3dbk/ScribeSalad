00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.630
Let's talk about maps.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.510
Hm, this wasn't exactly the kind
of map I wanted to talk about, but

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.500
it will do for now.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.190
The defining characteristic of
a map is its key value structure.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.800
You can look up where
something is by its key and

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.760
then get whatever is
stored at the value.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.900
This is actually pretty similar to
our normal definition of a map.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.670
We can look up something by its name and
then go to a location to get the value.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.400
For example,
let's say I wanted to find Winston.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.260
I can look him up by his key or
his name to figure out where he is and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.358
then go get him over here.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.949
Maps are also called dictionaries for
a similar reason.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.810
If you think of a word as a key and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.900
the definition as a value,
it's pretty much the same thing.
