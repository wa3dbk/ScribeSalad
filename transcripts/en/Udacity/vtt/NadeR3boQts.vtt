00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's go the cancer example. These are prior probability of cancer we should call P₀.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a probability of a positive test given cancer. I call this P₁

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and careful, there's a probability of a negative test result for don't have cancer and I call this P₂.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Just to check suppose probability of cancer is 0.1, the sensitivity is 0.9, specificity is 0.8.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Given the probability that a test will come out positive.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.077
It's not Bayes rule yet, it's a simpler calculation and you should know exactly how to do this.
