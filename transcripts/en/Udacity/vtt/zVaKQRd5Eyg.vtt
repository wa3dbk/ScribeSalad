00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.000
So how can we use what we've just learned? Well let's say that we have a

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.486
polynomial like this one that's pretty tough to factor. Here we have y equals x

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:12.750
cubed minus 4 x squared plus x plus 6. And I'll say It again. I think this is

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.657
really hard to factor. So how can we guess what the zeros might be? Remember

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:20.446
that's going to tell us what our factors are. Well, we know that the constant

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:25.588
terms in the factors need to multiply to equal 6. So, what then are all the

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:30.180
factors of 6? Please separate your answers by commas and don't forget the

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.299
negatives. They're perfectly valid factors, too, as long as they're integers.
