00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In order to improve this function I have to ask myself, "What do each of the loops do?"

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"And can I implement that in another way other than with nested loops?"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The answer seems to be that each of the nested loops is incrementing the word by one letter,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
from abcd to abcde, and then it's checking to see if we have a new word,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and it's checking to see if we should stop

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
if what we have so far is not a prefix of any word in the dictionary.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If I don't want to have nested loops what I want instead is a recursive procedure.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm going to have the same structure as before.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to start off by initializing the results to be the empty set,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then I'm going to have some loops that add elements to that set,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and then I'm going to return the results that I have built up.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then I'm going to start the loops in motion by making a call to this recursive routine.

00:00:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
What I want you to do is fill in the code here.
