00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.018
There are a number of ways to do this problem. I'm going to show you one of

00:00:04.018 --> 00:00:08.337
them. I can factor a 6a from the first two terms, leaving me with 4a minus bc in

00:00:08.337 --> 00:00:12.914
the parentheses. For the second parentheses, I could try pulling out a positive

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:16.779
5, but that would leave me with a negative 4a as my first term. I want a

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.293
positive 4a here. So instead of factoring a positive 5, let's factor a negative

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:26.172
5. If I factor a negative 5, I'll be left with 4a and negative bc. Here's where

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:30.803
you want to be really careful and check. If we distribute both of the terms, we

00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:35.712
should wind up with we started with. Most importantly, I'm concerned about this

00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:40.358
last term. I have negative 5 times negative bc. A negative times a negative is a

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:45.352
positive. So yes, this is correct. Finally, we factor out our 4a minus bc, which

00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:49.828
leaves us with this expression. So these are my two factors, and this is the

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:51.581
expression in factored form.
