00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.731
We can write this number as 16 million, or 16 followed by six zeros. When we

00:00:03.743 --> 00:00:07.601
think about writing this number, this can kind of be a pain. We have a ton of

00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:11.599
zeros and our number's pretty big. There are other extremely large and small

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:15.590
numbers like 2 trillion and 48 billionths. We don't want to have to write all

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:19.524
these zeros all the time, so let's figure out how we can do this differently.

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:23.562
Let's learn Scietific Notation. We don't want to have to write these zeroes all

00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:27.199
the time. It can be a pain. So instead, let's find another way to write these

00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:29.185
numbers. Let's learn scientific notation.
