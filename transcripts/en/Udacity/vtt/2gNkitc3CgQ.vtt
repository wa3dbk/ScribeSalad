00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.776
So why do we need computer architecture? We

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:05.428
need it if we want to improve performance

00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:08.704
for some definition of performance, which can be

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:12.136
speed at which the computation is going on, battery

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:15.100
life, the overall size of the computer, its

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.580
weight, energy efficiency, and so on. So we want

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.130
one or more of these to become better

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.426
than before. And another reason why we want computer

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:28.162
architecture is to improve some abilities of

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:31.402
the computer, such as adding 3D graphics support,

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:34.858
adding debugging support so developers can develop more

00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:38.860
bug free programs, improving security, et cetera. So

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.530
this is about making computers faster, smaller,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.520
and cheaper. And this is about making new

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.872
things possible. We do these by taking improvements

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:50.932
in fabrication technology and in circuit designs and

00:00:50.932 --> 00:00:55.216
figuring out how to translate that into faster, lighter, cheaper, more

00:00:55.216 --> 00:01:00.130
secure, et cetera. So this is where we need computer architecture.
