00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.170
Before we show you, a computationally more feasible way

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.490
of proving theorems in logic, or proving the truth value of sentence in logic.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.630
We should point out that so far, we have been using only propositional logic.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.750
Propositional logic is sometimes also called the zero-if order logic.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.310
The key aspect of propulsion logic, is that it does not have any variables. So

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.160
as an example, I may have a sentence that says if the animal Lays-eggs,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.770
and the animal Flies, then the animal is a Bird.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.950
And here I'm talking about a specific animal. Well, sometimes I might want to

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.100
talk about, animals in general, any animal, all animals. In that case,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.100
I would want to introduce a variables in it. So in first audilogic,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.910
otherwise known as predicate calculus, I might want to say something like.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.060
If x Lays-eggs and x Flies, then x is a Bird.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.850
Which has a set form very similar to form here, except that instead of animal,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.050
I now have a variable. Now, I have a variable here. But, I must also

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.000
specify the range of the variable. And what I really want to say here is for

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.680
all animals. Therefore I'll introduce a new quantifier over the variable x.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.250
This quantifier is called Universal Quantifier. It is denoted with the symbol,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.288
this is the symbol for Universal Quantifier. And this says now for all x,

00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:28.050
if x Lays-eggs, and x Flies it implies that x is a Bird.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.650
One thing to note here is that, I could have rewritten this sentence,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.460
with the Universal Quantifier back into proposition logic. But,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.978
having lots of sentences like this. In proposition logic. So I could've said

00:01:41.978 --> 00:01:46.758
Lays-eggs (animal) one, Flies (animal) one implies Bird (animal) one,

00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:51.930
Lays-eggs (animal) two, and Flies (animal) two implies Bird (animal) two.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.310
And so on and so forth, for each and every animal that is possible.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.820
But, by writing it in the form of a variable, a Universal Quantifier statement,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.290
I can reduce the number of sentences I have to write into just one sentence. So

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.130
we have introduced variables, and we have talked at least about

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.170
one quantifier so far, the Universal Quantifier, that applies for

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.800
all values that that variable can take. Sometimes I might want to specify

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.670
a different range of the variable. Not all values of the variable can take, but,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.210
at least some values of the variable I can take. So consider again,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.860
this sentence, here the animal is [UNKNOWN] a specific animal. Now let's look at

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.950
the second sentence on this screen. And this sentence is the variable y.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.420
It says if y Lays-eggs and y Flies then it implies that y is a Bird.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.265
This sentence is a very similar form, to the previous except for

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:52.240
the variable y. I can specify the value, that the variable y can take.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.730
This time I want to specify not that this sentence is true for all values of y,

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.650
for all animals, but simply that it is true for. Some at least one animal

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.950
in which case I'll use an Existential Quantifier. Here is the symbol for

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.810
an Existential Quantifier, this Existential Quantifier says that there is at

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.890
least one animal, for which this sentence happens to be true.
