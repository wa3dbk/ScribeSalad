Well, I hope your keyboard didn't melt. When I ran it, got an error message.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.070
Let me show you. The class compiled with no syntax erros. So I clearly don't

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.506
have a compile time error. But when I run the program, down here, I get an

00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:15.686
error message. And Bluej tells me that something very bad happened in the

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:20.155
highlighted line. First off, it is a run time error. It's an error that

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:24.184
happened at run time. And it is so bad that it terminated my program and

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:29.243
displayed what's called an exception report. And the report is that a division

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:34.284
by zero was attempted. And that's of course very, very bad. you've seen how to

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.880
deal with a number of different kinds of errors, and you'll get to practice

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.573
that with Sarah right now.
