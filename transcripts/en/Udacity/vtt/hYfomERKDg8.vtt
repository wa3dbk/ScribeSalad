00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
So we can see from this quiz that equations with two variables are really

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.934
powerful tools. However, not all variables that are connected, are connected in

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:13.504
the same way. For example, some situations will involve cause and effect, but

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:17.046
not all of them will. So bottom line, we need to think critically about the

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:20.329
quantities we're dealing with, when we're forming equations, to figure out how

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.752
we should connect the different variables that are involved. Remember that we

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:27.696
can often represent quantities in the real world with variables and then connect

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:31.806
these with equations. In these two situations that we just considered concerning

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:35.759
Athena's afternoon, we saw that there was a relationship of dependence between

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:40.140
the two things that we could express with variables. The number of sodas that

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.210
came out of the machine depended on the amount of money that Athena put into it.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.116
And the distance she driven along the road depended on the amount of time she

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:52.680
spent driving. In both of these cases the value of one variable helps determine

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.234
the value of another variable. So one way we could describe what dependence

00:00:57.234 --> 00:01:01.626
means in the case of algebra at least, is that in an equation that involves

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:06.090
dependence, the value of one of the variables helps determine the value of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.720
another variable. Now a couple of other situations that involve dependence

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.306
between quantities surfaced during Athena's trip. Athena used the gas pedal

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:19.530
while she was driving, and when she got to her brother's house she tossed him a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.549
can of soda. Now for each of these two new situations, please tell me which of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.853
the sentences below, probably describes the situation involving dependents.
