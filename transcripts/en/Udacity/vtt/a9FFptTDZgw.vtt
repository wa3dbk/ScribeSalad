00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.068
This next quiz is going to be a little trickier. It might require a little

00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:06.952
experimentation on your part. Feel free to try things in the Python interpreter,

00:00:06.952 --> 00:00:10.536
but if you keep in mind that everything you can reference in Python has a type,

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:15.422
I think you'll be able to solve it. And the riddle is if type of x is equal to

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:16.469
x, what is x?
