00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:02.170
Okay so, if I go to the documentation and

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.820
start writing navigation controller Xcode autocompletes it for me.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.680
It says here that the navigation interface, makes it possible to present your

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.170
data efficiently and makes it easier for the user to navigate that content.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.150
So that seems that UINavigation Controller.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.940
Will help me navigate between two different screens on my app.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.620
Cool, okay so if I go back to story board.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.880
I can see that the first screen of my app is right here.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.000
To add another one,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.640
I can open up utilities and add a new View Controller from this list.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.752
Notice that we are adding a View Controller in this case.

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:39.330
All right, I'm going to slide out of the utility area.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.910
And then arrange these View controllers properly.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.830
So here I have the first screen of my app, and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.970
imagine that this new View Controller which for now is empty,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.800
is going to contain a view which will display the second screen of my app.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.910
This screen is going to have all of the buttons,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.130
that will allow us to play sounds.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.060
For now all I want to do is connect this stop button,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.480
to this new View Controller.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360
Now the way to do this is to press and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.980
hold control on your keyboard, and then drag from the stop button.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.740
On to the new View Controller.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.990
This will present a bunch of options called segueways.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.360
You can think of segueways as transitions between these two View Controllers,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.950
almost like transitions between two different slides in a presentation.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010
I will select show.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.810
Okay. So the two View Controllers are connected.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.220
At this point, I'm going to try and run the app and see if it even works.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.730
I'm going to press the microphone button.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.200
All right, the recording label and the stop button start to show up correctly.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.490
So far so good.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.740
What happens after I click the stop button?

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.620
Hey, hey, here's the second screen of our app, and I also have the back button.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.640
And when I click that, I can go back to the first screen.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.630
Let me try one more time.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.430
This seems to be working.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.200
All right, so there are a couple of things I want to do back in the storyboard.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.800
I can add a title here.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.650
And then try to run the app again.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.802
All right, so you'll notice that the title of the first screen has changed, and

00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:04.790
then if I try to go to the second screen the back button there has also changed.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.565
Brilliant.

00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:10.050
By the way all of this back and forth navigation, this top bar and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.620
the back button.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.880
All of this, was accomplished by this UI Navigation Controller right here.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.110
So let's think about this, a little bit more deeply.
