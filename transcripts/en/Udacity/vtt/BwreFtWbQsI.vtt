00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This question is optional, but now that we know some more about

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
searching a graph, testing for connectedness,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and finding bridge edges, you might be able to improve

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
your Eulerian Tour finding routine from the first unit.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If you go back to the challenge problem in unit 1 and add the line

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
use<u>harder</u>tests = True to your code

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the grader will use more complicated graphs.
