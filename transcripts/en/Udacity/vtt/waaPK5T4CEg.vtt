00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.160
If you look at the diagram of the object relationships.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.090
You'll notice that it hasn't changed, since the prototypal version of our code.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.950
And that's because the pseudo-classical version is really just a thin layer of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.560
syntactic convenience over top of the prototypal pattern.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.110
In fact, the primary difference between these two patterns is the number of

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.880
performance optimizations that the JavaScript engines have implemented,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.001
that only apply when you're using the pseudo-classical pattern.
