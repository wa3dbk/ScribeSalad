00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.505
So let's try a slightly harder algorithm called list ranking.

00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:07.274
In list ranking, each node has the index of its successor in the list,

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:09.280
and we know the first element in the output.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.685
What we want to be able to do is put the nodes in order.

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:15.359
This has a number of uses, and in our lab, we've used it to decompress data

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.358
that's been compressed with B sub 2, so let's take a look at an example.

00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:20.298
As an example we've got 10 nodes here.

00:00:20.298 --> 00:00:22.925
We know that the output is going to begin with node 0

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:27.602
and the successor to node 0, so one farther in the chain is node 5.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:30.032
The successor to node 5 is node 2.

00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:32.503
The successor to node 2 is node 7 and so on.

00:00:32.503 --> 00:00:36.673
So this is our input--this array of 5, 6, 7, 9, 2, 3, 0, 1.

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:38.960
What's our output going to be?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.576
It's going to be the chain 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 9, 1, 6, 3, 8.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.082
So here's our input, and here's the output.

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:48.554
Now, you can note that the array is actually circular,

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:51.055
so it's necessary to actually designate the starting point,

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:54.390
and in this case we're saying that node number 0 is the starting point.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.428
Of course, a serial processor could do this N steps.

00:00:57.428 --> 00:01:00.924
The question is, how can we make it work with parallel hardware

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:03.468
with a smaller number of steps?
