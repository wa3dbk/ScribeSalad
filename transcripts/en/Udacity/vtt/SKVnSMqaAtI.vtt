00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.969
One way to solve this problem, is to look at the possibilities.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:12.580
We know that there is a bigger number, the median, and a smaller number.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.780
And that we have 3 inputs--

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.820
Let's call them "a," "b," and "c."

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.720
Let's say, for the sake of example--

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.630
that we figure out that "b" is the bigger number.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.460
We could solve this using the bigger function that you defined in lecture.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.500
&gt;From here, we only need to figure out what is the median and the smaller number.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.840
We know "b" can't be the median,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.910
because we just decided that it was the bigger number.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.640
&gt;From here, all we have to do is compare "a" and "c."

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.210
There are two cases at this point.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.010
One is where "a" is greater than "c."

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.420
If "a" is greater than "c," we know "c" is the smaller number--

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.490
and "a" is the median.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.390
If "c" is greater than "a," we know that "a" is the smaller number--

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.190
and "c" is the median.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.800
We can use this strategy to solve every possible case when defining our function.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.900
So let's take a crack at it by going right to the interpreter.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.670
So, first let's define our function.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.370
As specified in the problem, it's called median--and we take in 3 parameters.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.440
As I did before, we are going to call them "a," "b," and "c."

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.720
As I described earlier, we want to find the biggest number first, let's call it "big."

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.090
Here's the perfect time to use the function that we defined in class, "biggest."

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.890
"Biggest" will give us the biggest number, as the name describes--

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.630
by simply passing in those 3 parameters.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.930
&gt;From here, we enumerate the possible cases.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.100
As I described earlier, if "a" is the biggest number,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.000
you want to return the bigger number of "b" and "c."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.570
If "b" is the biggest number, we want to return the bigger number of "a" and "c."

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.840
And lastly, if "c" is the biggest number,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.540
which is satisfied by the else here,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
we want to return the bigger number of "a" and "b."
