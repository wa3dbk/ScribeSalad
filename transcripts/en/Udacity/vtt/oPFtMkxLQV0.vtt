00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.888
Now as I mentioned earlier variables and
numbers can be combined. And when we do

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.005
this, we create expressions. An expression
is what you get any time you put numbers

00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:15.183
and variables together, with mathematical
operators. So those are things like plus

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:20.429
minus divide and multiply. To make things
a little bit more concrete I'll write out

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:26.090
a few examples of expressions. So in each
of these expressions right here, you see

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:30.784
some terms that have variables in them.
Like 3x or, or -4m^4 / 13n^3.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.463
And these are combined with terms that are
just numbers, like 4 or -2. The separate

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:42.349
things that we add or subtract to come up
with the expressions are called terms. Any

00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:48.093
term that has a variable in it is called a
variable term like 7.8y / 3 or z and other

00:00:48.105 --> 00:00:53.687
terms that don't have variables in them
that are just numbers are called constants

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.353
or constant terms. I've only labeled the
types of terms in the first expression but

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:03.586
we could easily figure out what kinds of
terms are in the other two expressions, as

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:03.835
well.
