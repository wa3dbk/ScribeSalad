00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.480
So congratulations, you've made it to the end of unit one. You're

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.490
learned a lot of computer science already, you know what a program is,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.970
you've learned about variables, you've learned

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.970
about expressions and grammars, you've learned

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.770
about strings in Python. So now it's time for you to work on

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.640
homework one on your own. And that will check that you understood

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.030
everything from this class and prepare you to get started on unit two.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.950
And we're well on our way towards learning a lot of computer science,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.680
as well as building our web crawler and then building our search engine.
