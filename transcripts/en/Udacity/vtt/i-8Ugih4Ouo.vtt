00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, homework 5 should be pretty straightforward.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'd like your blog to output JSON instead of HTML, or rather in addition to HTML

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when the URL ends with .json.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's see how this looks in real life.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Here is the blog online and showing the 10 most recent entries.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If I were to add .json to this URL and load this URL, I would get a wall of text.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You can see in here there is some JSON.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's a list of dictionaries, and each of these dictionaries is one entry.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We'll look at the JSON for one entry so it's a little more clear.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If we were to go to blog entry 1002, which just is this short little entry, add JSON to this.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We do that and it returns just the dictionary.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The key is "content" equals "what a great body," "created" equals this date,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
"last_modified" equals this date, and "subject" equals "what a great title."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We'll be looking for content and subject in your response.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You should try to also include the dates.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Keep in mind that this date is not built into the JSON library in Python.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You're going to have to actually encode this yourself.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Remember when we talked about that strftime function in one of the previous homeworks?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Well, that's a good use of the strftime function to create this little date stream.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Remember that JSON data types don't include dates.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They just include integers, floats, strings, booleans, and a null.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You'll have to figure that out.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'd like you to have .json on both the permalink URL for the blog entry,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and on the entire blog itself.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Of course, you should also have new post continue to work.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If we were to enter a new post in here and submit this,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
if we were to go to the JSON for this post, we would see the JSON representation.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Here is our JSON. One last thing I'd like to point out to you.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If I were to open up our little debugger in Chrome here and reload this page,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
if we were to inspect this request,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the response has a content type of application/json_charset=utf-8.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It's important to get the content type right here.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We're not sending HTML anymore. We're sending JSON.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is the appropriate content type to use when you're sending JSON.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Make sure you set this header as well.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.820
When you have all that working enter your URL here.
