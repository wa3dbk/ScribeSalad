00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.540
So the best way to find out about anything is to Google it. So I typed in Python

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.310
keyword from. Here I scanned all of the results

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.440
that were available, and then from there I landed

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.070
on this web page. By the way the link to this web site is also available in the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.130
instructor notes. Now this webpage says that Python's from

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.770
statement let's you import specific attributes from a module. So

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.560
I guess it allows you to say from module or filename import something. So I

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.790
guess our code that means, that from

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.180
something called twilio.rest, we want to import TwilioRestClient.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.340
Now, this got me curious about what

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.980
these things called Twilio.rest and TwilioRestClient were. So

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.030
then I went back to Google and tried

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.260
to find out how Twilio was actually implemented,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.610
so I typed in Twilio Python Code. Then

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.820
I looked through these results and I got to

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.300
this website called GitHub. Here I could read

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.530
all of the code that actually makes Twilio work

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.260
behind the scenes, by the way, this link

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.000
is also available in the instructor notes. Now in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.480
the code for twilio I find that there was

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.640
a folder called twilio so I clicked on it,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.970
now inside that folder is another folder called rest. And within

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.520
rest there is a py on file which, if we look through, we will find that there is

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.600
a class called class TwilioRestClient inside it. So when we write this line

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.200
of code from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.640
what we are telling the computer is, hey, inside Twilio. There

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.360
is a folder called rest and inside that folder

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.810
is a class called twlio rest client and we are

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.010
going to use that class inside our code. And

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.260
if we go back and look in our code here

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.510
is how we are using that class twilio rest

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.870
client. Now you know if we were writing this code

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.760
from scratch we probably wouldn't have written this line

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.796
of code. We would have modified it to say from

00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:15.020
twilio import rest. Now with this line of code, what we are telling the computer

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.280
is, hey inside the folder twilio is

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.390
another folder called Rest. Import that because we

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.850
are going to use that in our program, and we know that inside the folder

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.090
rest is the class TwilioRestClient. So I would

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.180
now access that class by saying rest. TwilioRestClient.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.450
Let me save, and run this program one more

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.470
time to see if it still works. All right?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.530
Here's my phone and let's see if I get

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.830
a text message any time soon. [SOUND] Ah-hah! There's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.920
the text message, it seems like our program still

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.500
works. So in the next video what I want to

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.890
do is revisit the idea of how twilio, rest,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.660
and twilio rest client are related with one another.
