00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I think the best answer is really to search the web.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Buying a book, well that takes a lot of time, that cost money.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It might eventually help us but we're not patient enough, at least most computer sciences

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
aren't patient enough to wait for a book to arrive.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Phoning a friend might be a good thing to do and probably a good idea to call your mother,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but that's not probably not what's going to help you to make union and if you phone your friends

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
through our programmers and keep asking them how to solve all your programming problems,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
they might not be your friends for much longer.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Reading a Python documentation could definitely help, but you'll have to know where to start

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and you'll have to read a lot before you got to something helpful.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Search engines are your friend.
