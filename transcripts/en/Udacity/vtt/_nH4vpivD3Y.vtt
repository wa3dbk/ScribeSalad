00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.190
It's typically regarded as
a best practice that you not

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.590
use the SU command.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.390
Why?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.039
The rule of least privilege
that we discussed earlier.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.930
Do you really need to switch your entire
working context over to the root user

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.880
to run a single, or
even a few, commands?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.367
What happens if you forget that
you are currently within SU?

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:21.602
You could potentially do some
extremely damaging operations, and

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.220
there's no safety net there
to warn you when doing so.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.340
Now, not every user has the ability
to work as the superuser.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.689
You have to give that user
those permissions specifically.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.470
We'll cover that in more detail
when we start adding new users.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.220
For now, you know how to perform
operations as the root user, and that's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.670
all we need to start managing software
known as packages on this machine.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.690
So let's dive into that a bit.
