00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.953
Remember that slope is the change in y over the change in x. So, we just

00:00:03.965 --> 00:00:08.297
subtract one of our y-coordinates from the other and one of our x-coordinates

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.779
from the other, making sure to use the same point first in each case. I'm going

00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:17.060
to have this point give us our second coordinates and this point give us our

00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:20.044
first coordinates. This gives us a final answer of 5.
