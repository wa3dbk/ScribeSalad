00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.840
You have n numbers that must sum to 10. So your first number plus your second

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.524
number, plus all the way to the nth number, has to equal 10. You may choose a

00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:19.470
certain number of values, these xi's, any way you wish. But then a certain

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.260
number of values are forced, so that they sum to 10. How many degrees of

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.754
freedom are there? Or in other words, how many values may you choose any way

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:30.579
you wish. This is tricky.
