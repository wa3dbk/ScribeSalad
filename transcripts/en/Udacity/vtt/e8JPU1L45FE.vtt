00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.890
So now we need our observation model,
okay?

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.222
So we're going to use, it's, it's
referred to as probabilistic PCA but

00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:09.830
we're basically going to use PCA.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.000
And given some possible location,
we have to evaluate that

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.300
observation as saying, well, how likely
is it that that's the right place?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.100
And what it's going to mean is,
how well can I generate that?

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.340
And the math that was done here, this
is the math that sort of justifies this

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.450
idea of distance from face space,
all right?

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.900
So, here's the idea.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.970
Let's suppose I have some
eigen vector subspace.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.800
This is face space.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.710
And that's written as B here.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.460
Okay?

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.585
And so
that's just shown as this plane in 3D.

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:44.965
So the idea being I'm only using
two dimensions, let's say.

00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:46.904
So I'm assuming everything's in a plane.

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:50.003
And furthermore,
it's got some mean value there.

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:53.590
And in this plane is in face space.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.485
All right?

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:59.125
And what this little ellipse shows you
is, this is sort of the probabilistic

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.762
distribution of how the faces
fall within that space.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.583
And now I have some observation z here.

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:10.498
What this equation is saying here,
is that the probability

00:01:10.498 --> 00:01:15.137
of getting some point z,
our observation, all right?

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:18.794
Is distributed about the mean, okay?

00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:20.895
So then what's the most likely face?

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:24.524
The most likely face is the mean face.

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:26.648
The mean is the average, right?

00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:29.446
That's the most like, that's
the center of the normal distribution.

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:31.777
And what this equation says is that,

00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:35.620
the probability sort of
breaks down into two parts.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.803
There is a distance that has
to do with sort of your,

00:01:38.803 --> 00:01:42.505
your co-variance or
your variances in the face space, and

00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:46.220
then there's a distance that's
sort of out of face space.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.740
The amount of difference
from the reconstruction.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.786
So that's written like this, where the
idea is that this BB transpose, that's

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:58.682
the co-variance matrix sort of within
face space, and then we're going to just

00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:03.453
say some epsilon I, I is an identity
matrix, epsilon is some small number.

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:07.730
So things get to come out
of that plane a little bit.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.070
Okay?
So faces are mostly in face space and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.140
they move away a little bit.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.190
Now what happens is,
as epsilon goes to zero, or

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.360
just as epsilon becomes small, or
another way of saying that is,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.600
that the variance within face space
covers most of the faces, and

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.220
there's only a little
bit of variance left.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.962
What this says is that really,

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:33.647
you can think of that as this
variance becomes bigger and bigger,

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:37.474
that the only thing that matters is
how far you are out of face space.

00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:42.334
So it's mostly a function between
the point z that you've observed and

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:46.470
the face space that's
spanned by these vectors.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.333
So the math behind this can be
written in the following way.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:52.048
What this says is, that p of z given B.

00:02:52.048 --> 00:02:57.575
So the probability of some observation
given face space, is an exponential, so

00:02:57.575 --> 00:03:02.962
it's going to be decreasing, as
a function of the square of this term.

00:03:02.962 --> 00:03:07.883
And what this term is,
is it's the difference,

00:03:07.883 --> 00:03:10.891
so z minus mew is this, okay?

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:13.666
Subtract off the reconstructions.

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:15.547
So this little blue thing
is the reconstruction.

00:03:15.547 --> 00:03:21.027
So if I subtract that off, all I
get is this distance to face space.

00:03:21.027 --> 00:03:22.795
And so what I'm going to do is,

00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:27.730
I'm going to evaluate the distance to
face space for the reconstruction.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.577
And later when we're
tracking something else,

00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:31.794
it's going to be the distance
to whatever my eigen space is.

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:35.834
So a question is,
why is that term the reconstruction?

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:40.396
Why is that term the projection
of z onto that plane.

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:43.238
Well, it's actually
pretty straightforward.

00:03:43.238 --> 00:03:49.400
So if B is D by K, all right?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.680
B transpose is just K by K by D,
all right?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.700
So what is z minus u?

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.461
Z minus u is just the vector of
the new observation minus the mean.

00:03:58.461 --> 00:03:59.553
Okay?

00:03:59.553 --> 00:04:04.615
So B transpose times z minus u,
that's just the dot

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:10.190
product of all the eigen
vectors with z minus u.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.640
That's just the co-efficient vector.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.680
So this thing right there,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.480
the transpose z minus u,
that's the co-efficient vector.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.332
And we can call that gamma.

00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:21.490
All right?

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.470
Well, given the coefficient
vector I can reconstruct.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.460
How do I do that?

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.190
I just multiply that, I multiply
B times the coefficient vector,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.910
that will be the, each coefficient times
each of the eigen vectors summed up.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.930
So that's the reconstruction.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.070
So when I'm all done,
this z minus mew minus the total

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.820
reconstruction gives me just the amount
that you're out of that plane.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.510
That you're out of the face space or
the eigen space.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.237
Another way of saying it is,
that's how much of the signal you cannot

00:04:51.237 --> 00:04:54.860
reconstruct, using the vectors
that are just in that basis set.
