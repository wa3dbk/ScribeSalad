00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.900
So because the Loads in our processor need to be done as

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.980
soon as possible while the Stores do not write to memory until commit,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.220
we said we need the Load-Store queue so that we can supply the values from

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.150
Stores to Loads. This Load-Store queue, or LSQ,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.620
is a structure just like the ROB, meaning we put things there in order and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.000
remove them at commit. But we only put Load and Store instructions there, so

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.100
there is a bit that says which instruction do we have, Load or

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.840
Store? There is a field for what is the address this instruction is accessing.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.300
And there is a field for the value that the instructions should be storing or

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.460
loading. There is also a field for,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.560
this instruction has been completed. Now let's suppose we have this program, and

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.720
suppose that the Load-Store queue is initially empty. So as we said,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.440
things are going to be placed here in program order. So the first instruction

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.710
here is going to be a Load. Let's say that we quickly compute the address, and

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.626
it's 104. This load, because there are no previous stores,

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:14.140
will go to memory. The next instruction here is a Store.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.440
Let's say that it computes the address of 204. Let's say that the value is 15,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.710
and we mark it down. And let's say that this instruction is kind of delayed so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.470
it doesn't return yet, so we still have all of these in the Load-Store queue.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.390
The next Load, let's say it eventually computes the address of 204.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.430
For every Load, when it computes the address, we check in the Load-Store queue

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.080
if any store matches that address. If there is no matching Store,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.960
like equals case for this Load because there were no Stores, we go to memory.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.210
If there is a matching Store, we do not go to memory.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.370
Instead we do what is called the Store-to-Load forwarding, where we simply

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.510
take the value from the Store and that is the value that the Load produces, and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.090
we never go to memory. So again, this is called Store-to-Load forwarding.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.570
Now of course, this assumes that at the time we want to do this Load, the Stores

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.960
have already been completed, and we now know what the addresses are and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.300
if we need to get the value, we know what the value is.
