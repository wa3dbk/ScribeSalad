00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.367
So far, we've been dealing with quadratic polynomials, like x squared plus 5 x

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:08.473
plus 6, to figure out how to factor this. We've been looking for two numbers

00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:12.633
that add to equal the middle term coefficient, and multiply to equal the final

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.859
coefficient. So, in the case of this polynomial, we end up with 2 and 3 as our

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.178
two coefficients. What if I told you, though, that this quantity a,b, in other

00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:25.402
words, the product of the two numbers that add to equal the middle coefficient,

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:29.771
is also equal to the product of two coefficients from the original expression.

00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:34.012
Let's just play around with this for a second, though. I'm going to name each of

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:38.766
the coefficients of each term in this three term expression A, B, and C. So, A

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:44.211
in this case is 1, B is 5, and C is 6. So before we found the two numbers that

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:49.073
add to equal this term, they were 2 and 3. But what if I told you that these

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:54.001
multiply to equal not just this final term, but actually the product of two of

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:59.390
the coefficients in this expression over here. So the two numbers we found to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.647
equal this coefficient B, multiply to equal what? Do they multiply to equal A

00:01:05.647 --> 00:01:09.536
squared, B squared, C squared, AB, BC, or AC?
