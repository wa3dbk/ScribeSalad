00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.980
Congratulations on finishing lesson five. Here, we

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.840
took many of the basic techniques you learned

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.500
in previous lessons and extended them to

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.940
look at patterns across many variables at once.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.020
&gt;&gt; We started with simple extensions to the scatter plot,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.182
and plots of conditional summaries that you worked with in

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:22.740
lesson four, such as adding summaries for multiple groups. Then,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.790
we tried some techniques for examining a large number of variables

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.410
at once, such as scatter-plot matrices and heat maps.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.570
&gt;&gt; We also learned how to reshape data, moving from

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.050
broad data with one row per case, to aggregate data

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.200
with one row per combination of variables, and we moved

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.230
back and forth between long and wide formats for our data.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.320
&gt;&gt; Next up in lesson six, we'll hear from our colleague

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.890
Solomon. He's going to do an in-depth analysis of the diamond

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.770
data set, so you can see how an expert does it. Lesson six also covers a larger

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.120
part of the data analysis process, highlighting the role

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.310
of EDA. Solomon did a lot of reading about

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.550
the diamond industry. He wrote codes to scrape

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.310
and format a new data set, and he used

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.560
the results of his exploratory data analysis to guide,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.150
interpret, and evaluate a statistical model of diamond prices.
