00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.230
Like I said, that's the end of
the work we're going to do on

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.130
sort of direct motion.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.470
So basically we've looked at two
generally different ways of doing this,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.010
of doing motion estimation
between two frames.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.060
One can, that can handle
sort of large range sparse,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.750
we find particular features and
we come up with descriptors.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.860
Then we find them in the, second image.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.950
We think we know which
matches are right.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.530
We guess to see which
pairings are correct.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.670
Look for a motion model,
and maps them across.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.550
And that works well.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.920
We can have lots of differences
between the points, but

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.020
we have to have a consistent
model across them.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.070
And then we do that ransack thing, etc.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.330
The other method are much more direct or
optic flow or

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550
spatial temporal methods where pixels
may be deforming in a variety of ways.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.200
We've got some patch going one way,
another patch doing another,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.540
maybe a patch is stretching,
twisting, whatever.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.820
And we're going to use the idea
that we can take spatial and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.570
temporal derivatives in order
to tell how things are moving.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.300
You know, one way of thinking about
is that the first method is good for

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.360
movement of tens of pixels, so things
move a lot and they may have changed.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.160
So I take a picture over here and take
a picture over there of the same thing,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.680
and I want to figure
out which one is which.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.730
Okay?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.050
The motion ones are better when things
are moving a small amount, you know,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.040
less than ten p, a small amount of
motion, but maybe lots of frames.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.150
So like in a movie when you see nice,
smooth motion between something,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.320
that's when you would think about
the direct optical flow of methods.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.360
So now you have,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.410
sort of in your tool kit, a variety of
ways of computing motion between frames.
