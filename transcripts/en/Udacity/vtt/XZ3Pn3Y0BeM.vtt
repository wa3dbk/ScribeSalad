00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
Over the past few minutes, we've talked about how the sum of two cubes and the

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:08.388
difference of two cubes can be factored. And we learned earlier about how the

00:00:08.388 --> 00:00:12.945
difference of two squares can be factored. Seems logically then like we should

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.355
also be able to factor the sum of two squares, something in the form a squared

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:22.008
plus b squared. What is the factored form of that though? Let's talk about this.

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:26.323
Earlier we saw a difference of two squares that was x squared minus 1. So let's

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:30.477
turn this into the sum of two squares instead, to see if that is something we

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:35.080
can factor. So let's consider x squared plus 1 instead of x squared minus 1. So

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.706
I'd like you to think through how we might factor x squared plus 1. And if you

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:44.324
can find a way to do it, check yes and write in the factors. And if you can't

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.379
find a way to do it, then check no.
