The drinking bird most definitely needs a tail. And at long last, we're going

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.410
to give him a feather. I've set up the tail polygon. This was a bit tricky, in

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.940
fact. To avoid adding an object 3D, I added some code to change the order of

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.079
the oiler angles are evaluated. Your task is to add the semi-transparent

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.770
feather texture to the tail. This is how it should look when you're done.
