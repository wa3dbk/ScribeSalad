00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.860
Here are the factor pairs for negative 20. In the first three factor pairs I

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.518
made the first number negative and the second three factor pairs I made the

00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:11.272
second number negative. The only factor pair that adds to negative one is four

00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:15.335
and negative five. So these must be the answer and we could have switched these

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:19.417
around. I could have had the 4 over here and the negative 5 on this side too.

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:24.001
These are the factor pairs for negative 24. I want to find the factor pair that

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.390
has a sum of negative 5. That would be 3 and negative 8. So those set is to be

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.037
my factors. Here are the factor pairs for negative 36. I've only made the first

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:37.445
set negative. I know negative 4 and 9 sum to 5 so this should be my answers to

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:42.536
the number puzzle. Now if none of these factor pairs added to 5, I would have

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:47.433
made this column positive and this column negative. Then I could continue

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:48.229
searching.
