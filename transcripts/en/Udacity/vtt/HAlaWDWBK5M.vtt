00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.800
Let's look at the answer to
our fault classification quiz.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.860
The phone got wet.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.930
By cause,
it's definitely an environmental fault.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.440
What kind of fault by duration is it?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.670
Getting wet is a transient fault.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.490
Eventually it gets dry.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.460
The explosion would have been
a permanent fault from which you

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.570
really cannot recover, but
getting wet is only a transient fault.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.000
Now because the phone was supposed to
prevent itself from running when wet,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.600
the fact that it did heat up, and

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.650
it wasn't suppose to,
is an indication of a design fault.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.590
So really,
it was suppose to not do this but

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.030
the way it was designed actually made
it do that, so it's a design fault.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.670
And design faults
are typically permanent.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.890
And this is one more example
of when you can have a fault

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.490
that never becomes an error or failure.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.560
So the permanent fault of
being poorly designed so

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.750
that when it gets wet it can heat up and
explode would never become an error or

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.260
a failure until we actually
get that particular phone wet.
