00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.080
&gt;&gt; So when should an entrepreneur
start thinking about accessibility?

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.130
&gt;&gt; From the beginning, immediately.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.705
Even just during the product
conception phase,

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:10.974
it's critical to be thinking about this.

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:15.252
You should be thinking about how
could this really benefit and

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:19.540
improve the life of a user with or
without a disability?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.529
Thinking about how can my product
be used in various situations?

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.331
Things like that are very important.

00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:28.435
I think a good example is Google Books,

00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:33.040
which was became really
beneficial to everyone in that.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.710
Now that all of these books that
were tucked away in libraries across

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.950
the world were digitized and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.050
you could see them just by
typing in your computer.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.180
So now only is it beneficial to you and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.060
I, but
folks that use screen readers now.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.777
They are able to use these, have these
books read to them via screen reader,

00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:51.983
which in the past,
they would have to wait for

00:00:51.983 --> 00:00:55.377
a braille version, which are very
costly and time consuming to get.

00:00:55.377 --> 00:00:59.984
So this is a great example of
why it's important to think of

00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:01.684
these things early.

00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:04.272
&gt;&gt; So how do you go about designing for
all users and

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:08.550
what sort of lessons learned from Google
Books or maybe other digital projects

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.930
should entrepreneurs be aware of and
know about?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.970
&gt;&gt; So, I think the first
thing is to just for you and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.303
your team members to become familiar
with accessibility basics and

00:01:19.303 --> 00:01:24.108
most importantly is understanding
the needs of users with disabilities.

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:26.635
So when you're starting out any project,

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:30.493
you want to reach out to users that
you think will be your end user and

00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:34.440
understand their needs,
their challenges, their pain points.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.055
And so this is the exact same thing
you want to do with people with

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:37.772
disabilities.

00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:40.202
So reaching out to folks
that you feel like,

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:44.474
meet your target audience that also
have impairments is really important and

00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:46.916
the insights that you
gain are invaluable.

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:50.556
The other thing you want to do is
become more familiar with assistive

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:51.760
technologies.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.132
So, assistive technologies are tools
that a number of people use to just

00:01:56.132 --> 00:02:00.362
kind of help them achieve the same
task that other people would with just

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:02.097
a little bit of assistance.

00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:05.935
So examples of this are closed
captioning in videos,

00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:09.360
where you can see the words
that are being said.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.502
You see those typed at
the bottom of those.

00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:15.362
There are magnification
devices that people with

00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:17.460
low vision might need to use.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.039
There are screen meters,

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.998
which essentially read the contents
of the screens to the users.

00:02:22.998 --> 00:02:26.519
So you don't have to become
an expert on these, by any means,

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.493
because that would take forever.

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:32.524
But just understanding the basics,
as well as watching and

00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:35.290
observing somebody use these.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.840
Specifically, watching them, use the
technologies with your product is again,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.550
it's one of the most eye opening
experiences I've ever had.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.333
And then I think another thing to keep
in mind is that there are a number of

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.243
online resources for
accessibility design guidelines,

00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:58.130
that give you lots of points of what
to consider when you're designing.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.944
So an example might be,
when you're in the visual design stage,

00:03:02.944 --> 00:03:06.630
you want to be thinking
about good color contrast.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.116
So that users with low vision can
actually read what's on the screen or

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:10.775
on the page.

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.850
When you're thinking about interaction
design, you want to ensure that again,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.624
what we talked about before where the
keyboard users that only use a keyboard

00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:25.050
are able to complete all of the tasks
that they're trying to achieve.
