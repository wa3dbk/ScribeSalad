00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.046
So to help Grant out, we're going to need to be able to solve this inequality.

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:08.145
But this is unlike other inequalities we've looked at before, because this is a

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:12.413
quadratic inequality. You can see that if we multiplied out the terms here, we'd

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:16.526
end up with some term that has an x squared in it. So this isn't linear anymore.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:20.692
Even though, when we're dealing with inequalities, we can do many of the same

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:24.917
operations that we can And when working with equation, we do need to be a little

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:29.312
bit more careful. Do you remember which situation might at some points cause us

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:33.327
to have to switch the direction of inequality. Please check off any of the

00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:37.400
situations where this might happen depending on what number we are using.
