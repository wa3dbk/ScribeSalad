00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.670
In order to talk about what's
going on in network protocols,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.500
it helps to have a bit
of a visual language.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.600
Just as we might use a line graph
to depict a financial trend or

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.760
a histogram to show the distribution of
a variable, there's a particular kind of

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.810
chart that's useful for
illustrating network protocols.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.090
It's called a sequence diagram and
here's an example.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.820
This is a diagram of an HTTP
connection using keep-alive.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.680
These two lines on the left and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.760
right are timelines, with time
advancing from the top to the bottom.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.230
The line on the left represents
the client's view of the world.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.360
The line on the right is
the server's view of the world.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.400
And these arrows between
them represent messages sent

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.180
from the client to the server or
from the server to the client.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:50.340
You'll sometimes see them drawn at an
angle, which serves to remind you that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.110
messages are never instantaneous,
there's always latency or

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.050
lag time between when the client sends
something and the server receives it or

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.710
vice versa.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.750
But conventionally,
they're drawn straight and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750
we just have to remember that
time never goes backwards.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.732
Now because we haven't
invented time travel,

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.830
anything that either end
does at any point in time,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.760
can only be affected by things
that that end has already seen.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.350
Like if the client sends two requests
and the server starts responding to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.100
the first one as soon as it sees it,
the server can't

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.160
change its first response on
the basis of the second request.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.420
It hasn't seen that second one yet.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.260
Sequence diagrams remind us
to keep things in order and

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.860
to make sure that our notions of
what's going on in the network

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.690
don't assume that servers
can see the future.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.820
So, here's what's going
on in this diagram.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.120
The client since an HTTP GET request
with a connection keep alive header.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.390
The server sends a response and
once a client has received that response

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.040
it can send another request over
the same connection and so on.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.380
Here's the thing, though,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.060
a sequence diagram always represents
some particular level of a protocol.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.140
Like here's a diagram for

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.070
just one request at the HTTP layer
with a HTTP GET and a response.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.410
But this doesn't show
individual IP packets.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.740
And I assure you that if that response
is a download of a six megabyte file,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.330
it's not going to happen as simply
as just one arrow suggests.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.850
When we look deeper into the stack,
we'll find that one exchange on

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.250
the HTTP level may be a shorthand for
a bunch of exchanges on a lower level.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.710
In fact, let's take a closer
look at that right now.
