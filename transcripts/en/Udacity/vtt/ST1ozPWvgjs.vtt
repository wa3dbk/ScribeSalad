00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.030
To illustrate the idea of
a polynomial reduction,

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.210
we're going to reduce the problem of
finding an independent set in the graph,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.500
to that of finding a vertex cover.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.230
In the next lesson, we're going to
argue that if P is not equal to NP,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.710
then independent set is not in P,
so vertex cover can't be either.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.360
But that's getting ahead of ourselves.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.410
First, for the benefit of those not all
ready familiar with these problems,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.330
we will state them briefly.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.770
First will consider the independent set
problem and see how it is equivalent to

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.905
the clique problem that we talked
about when we introduced the class NP.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.500
Given a graph, a subset of
the vertices is an independent set

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.530
if there are no edges between
the vertices in the set S.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.172
For example, these two vertices here
do not form an independent set because

00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:46.140
there's an edge between them.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.320
However, these three vertices
do form an independent set

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.580
because there are no edges between them.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.200
Clearly each individual vertex
forms an independent set

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.800
since there isn't another vertex in
the set for it to have an edge with.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.830
And the more vertices we add, the harder
it is to find new ones to add.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.640
So, finding a maximum independent
set is the interesting question.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.960
Or, phrased as a decision problem,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.450
the question becomes given a graph g,
and an integer k, at most,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.440
the number of vertices, does g
have an independent set of size k?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.260
Note that this problem is in NP.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.820
Given a subset of the vertices, it's
easy to count them to make sure that

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.860
there are indeed k, and check that
there are no edits between them.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.790
This problem is so

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.640
close to the clique problem that
the two are usually considered as one.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.890
The set is independent in a graph if and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.100
only if there's a clique
in the complement graph.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.770
By the complement graph,
I mean the one where there is no edge

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.440
if there was an edge between two
vertices in the original, and

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.130
there is an edge if there
wasn't one in the original.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.420
Not having any edges between a set
of vertices in the original graph is

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.700
the same as having all the edges among
the vertices in the complement graph.
