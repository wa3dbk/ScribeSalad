00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.190
There's a difference between
a business making a lot of money,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.710
and actually being profitable.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.380
Right?

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.939
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.030
We want our start-up to generate
earnings that eclipse its expenses.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.890
If our business generate 1
million a month in revenue,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.690
but need to pay in expenses one and
a half, we are in a problem.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.840
However, if in the same scenario,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.570
our expenses are only half a million,
then we are generating real profits.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.030
&gt;&gt; So,
how do we make our start-up profitable?

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.560
&gt;&gt; It's very easy.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.240
You should follow these
three simple steps.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.510
First, build a wonderful,
amazing product, so

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.250
good your user can't ignore it.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.630
Second, charge money for it.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.450
Third, boom profits!

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.490
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, that sounds so easy.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.550
Let's just end the course right here.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.230
I mean, but just because somebody
puts a price tag on a product doesn't

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.130
mean that someone's going to pay it.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.300
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.780
As Warren Buffett used to say, price
is what you pay, value is what you get.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.430
This is why you should focus on
creating real value for your customers.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.625
People will be willing to pay if they
see and recognize the value in it.

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:09.290
You got a bigger chance of building
a profitable business that is

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.280
making 2 million a year,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.000
rather than trying to create the next
multi-billion dollar business.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.805
If you think on your
start-up from this angle,

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:20.160
you got a higher probability
to make it happen.
