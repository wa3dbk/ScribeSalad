00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.939
Once the iOS kernel has started,
it controls which user processes and

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.700
apps can be run to ensure that
all apps come from a known or

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.010
approved source and
have not been tampered with.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.720
iOS requires that all executable code

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.500
be signed using an Apple
issued certificate.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.230
More specifically, apps provided
with the device, such as Mail or

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.880
Safari, are already signed by Apple.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.530
Third party apps must
also be validated and

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.468
signed using an Apple-issued
certificate.

00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:35.310
This mandatory co-signing extends the
concept of chain of trust from the iOS

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.080
to the apps, and prevents third party
apps from loading unsigned code, or

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.946
using self modifying code.

00:00:41.946 --> 00:00:46.900
A run time co-signature checks
of all executable memory pages

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.350
are being performed as the pages
are loaded to ensure that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.430
our apps has not been modified since
it was installed or last updated.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.590
This is done through a user-space
daemon and is enforced by the kernel.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.640
In summary,
iOS enforces mandatory code signing and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.450
identification to extend the chain
of trust from iOS to the apps.
