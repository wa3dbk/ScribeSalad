00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's about time to get even one dimension more, heat conduction in 2D.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So, we're talking about temperature distribution that depends on time, on x and as a premiere on y.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One way for visualizing this is a movie.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Each frame of the movie depicts the temperature distribution in x and y

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
at that precise instance of time, then we come to the next frame of the movie

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which shows us the next distribution in x and y and so on and so on

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and what we expect to see is diffusion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If there's only one hot spot at the beginning, it should gradually dilute over time.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The heat equation in 2 dimensions does not contain any surprise.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The partial derivative of the temperature with respect to time

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
equals α times the second derivative of the temperature with respect to x

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
plus the second derivative of temperature with respect to y.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Note aside, this expression is often called the Laplace operator applied to T.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Don't confuse this triangle with the delta. It's also often called the Laplacian.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You can imagine the Laplace operator to measure something like

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the bend of a surface in 2 dimensions and there's a very simple

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
finite-difference scheme for that differential equation as well.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, we're looking at one point at the current time and the current values left and right,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
below and above to compute the next value at that central position.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That next value is temperature after one time step at x and y and we can spell out our estimate.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This is the value before times 0 x and y plus the time step

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
times the diffusivity divided by the spatial step size squared and now we got lots of terms

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The values of our function to the left, to the right, below, and above all at times 0

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to the left (x - Δx0₁), to the right (x + Δx), below (y - Δx), and above (y + Δx).

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Hopefully, it's not already confusing that I'm using Δx to also denote the increment of y.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now that we've covered the outer point, the inner point remains.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
In one dimension, we are to subtract twice the value of the inner point.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In two dimensions, we have to subtract four times its value.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's easy to see that this has to be a factor of 4. Imagine that it's equal to 100 Kelvin everywhere

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
then we get 100 + 100, (+), (+) makes 400.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We subtract 4 times 100 so we get 0. The new temperature will be old temperature as it has to be.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
There's nothing that could be smooth out if the temperature is already constant in space.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This factor out 4 also hints at what's going to happen with instability.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We have to be even more picky about the step size.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It can only be half as large as in the one dimensional case.

00:03:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And the other artifacts that we are going to see close to instability are checkered board patterns.
