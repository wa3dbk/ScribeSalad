Albert Bandura is a famous psychologist known for his research on social

00:00:03.385 --> 00:00:07.485
learning. He conducted a series of really well known studies that showed us how

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:12.364
sensitive we were to learning from the consequences of other people. And he did

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:17.305
so using this guy. A bobo doll. The famous 1960s bobo doll case focused on two

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:22.507
areas of social learning, modeling and reinforcement. Modeling is a term that

00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:25.963
Van Duren used to describe the process of observing and imitating behaviors

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:29.974
performed by other people. Now, reinforcement is just like with

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:30.546
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:34.969
conditioning where we add something to increase the frequency of the behavior.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.745
Van Duren noted that people will do things other people do especially if they

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:40.810
are rewarded for it.
