00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.030
To make sure that the buttons do not appear in the page

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.010
until after the animation has run through,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.900
thus preserving the author driven part of our narrative.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.170
All we need to do is put the same code that I just showed you

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.100
that creates the buttons in the conditional statement that clears our interval.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.310
So again, if you remember, we set our interval and once we run out of years,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.220
to show an update, we call clearInterval and exited.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.190
But in our case, we want to first clear the interval, and now add some buttons.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.350
So let's see what that looks like.
