00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's going to turn out that there are 8.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
There's the global frame. There's our call factorial 6.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There's factorial 5, 4......1, and in fact, if you look carefully--this was a bit of a trick--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
at our termination condition for this recursive procedure,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we actually call in here when n is 0.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, if we include the global frame.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And how many of those will n have the same value?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
None of them. It's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and undefined.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's never the same.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We're honestly doing different computation going through different values.
