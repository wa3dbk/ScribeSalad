00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.828
The trick is to change these numbers over here

00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:05.772
to numbers that trigger once in a decade and

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.768
this is as simple as changing the 1.96 to 6.5

00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:11.405
which is really kind of a minor change, but this

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:13.196
makes all the difference. The percentage now

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:16.645
becomes so small, you get one trigger per decade.

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:18.365
So let’s quickly compute what the numbers look

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:21.000
like for 6.5.
