00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.740
Let's look at the solution to
our write-update coherence quiz.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.230
Where what we had is
four accesses like this

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.610
happening in a write-update
coherent set of caches.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.410
After the first read completes here,
we have data 6,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.710
tag 700 hex, and the valid bit is one.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.400
So when this read completes,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.180
we have a valid with 1 here,
the data is 6 and the tag is 700.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.662
At that time, in these other caches,
the valid bit is simply zero,

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:36.590
because they have not
accessed anything yet.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.760
When core 1 reads, it sets the valid
bit and fetches the same data.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.850
When core 2 writes, it broadcasts
the value in the address, so these

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.010
caches that already have this block
will update what they have now to 17.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.480
And now, of course, on core 2,
this block starts being valid and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.000
has a value of 17.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.599
And finally, when core 3 reads,
it also gets the value of 17.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.350
So, this is the final
state of the caches.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.450
All caches have the block and all caches
have the same value of the block.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.980
Which means that really the caches
are coherent for this block.
