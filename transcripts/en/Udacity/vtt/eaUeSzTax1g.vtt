00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.213
The GCF is 9 x squared y squared. Let's see why. This would be the prime

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:08.186
factorization for 45 x squared y cubed. And this would be the prime

00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:12.326
factorization for 36 x to the fourth y squared z. I'm going to regroup my

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:16.837
numbers together so that we have the 2's together and the 3's together. I want

00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:21.702
to find the lowest power of each factor that appears in both terms. We know that

00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:26.336
3 appears in both terms, and in fact a power of 3 squared appears in both terms.

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:30.797
So that's going to start the product of my greatest common factor. This number

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:35.199
has a 5, however this number does not, so I can't list 5 as part of my greatest

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.626
common factor. However X is a factor that appears in both terms and we have a

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:44.195
power of X squared that is common between them. So we can list X squared in the

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:49.215
product of our GCF. And finally, they both share the lowest power of y squared,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:53.882
so we can include that in our GCF as well. The greatest common factor is the

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:58.698
product of all of these factors together. So we have 9 times x squared times y

00:00:58.698 --> 00:00:59.325
squared.
