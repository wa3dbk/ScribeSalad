00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.243
Let's practice some compound inequalities. The first one I want you to try, is 2

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:10.075
x minus 1 is greater than 4 x plus 3, and 5 x plus 3 is greater than or equal to

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:14.857
3 x minus 7. You can put your answer here. When you input your answer, use

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.253
interval notation. Remember, when you're using interval notation, you want to

00:00:19.265 --> 00:00:23.365
use parentheses for greater than or less than, and square brackets for less than

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:26.843
or equal to and greater than or equal to. Good luck.
