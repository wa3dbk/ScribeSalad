00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.140
Now that we can declare tasks,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.580
it's time to start thinking about
the relationships between tasks.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.180
For example,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.470
in a Java build we can't jar up our
library before compiling our sources.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.390
We model these relationships by
task dependencies and order.

00:00:14.825 --> 00:00:18.345
We'll discuss three ways to configure
the relationships between tasks.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:20.955
Depends on, finalize by,
and must run after.

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:24.165
Task A depends on Task B,

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:27.529
if Task A can't do its work without
Task B having done its work.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.180
To take a familiar example,
when you're getting up in the morning,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.140
you can't put on your shoes without
putting on your socks first.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.450
Let's declare and configure some tasks.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.610
So here's our tasks that represent
getting ready in the morning.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.170
We've got put on socks,
just prints a message,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.050
put on shoes also just prints out
that we're putting on our shoes.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.770
The new thing is we've got
this depends on function.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.660
And we just passed the task name
that put on shoes depends on.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.810
In this case, put on socks.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.350
So, let's give put on shoes a try.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.500
And we are running Gradle on quiet mode,
so

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.410
that we don't see all
those diagnostic output.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.880
We just see the printed messages.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.010
There we go, when we try to put on our
shoes Gradle realized we can't put on

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.790
our shoes without putting on our socks,
so we ran that first.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.050
The next type of task dependency we're
going to talk about is finalized by.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.760
We say task A is finalized by task B.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.370
If every time task A runs,
task B should be run afterwards.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.650
To continue our example,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.980
every time you eat breakfast, you really
should brush your teeth afterwards.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.310
We have those tasks here.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.000
We've got the eat breakfast task,
and the brush your teeth task.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.050
And we note that eat breakfast is
finalized by brush your teeth.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.780
So, let's see what happens
when we try to tell Gradle to

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.920
just run the eat breakfast task.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.410
Looks like Gradle It was
keeping us honest and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.980
made us brush our teeth
after we ate breakfast.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.860
The use case for
must run after is slightly less obvious.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.630
Say we have a long running
process that's unlikely to fail,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.430
like deploying some artifact to
a continuous integration server.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.090
And we also have a short running
task that is likely to fail,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.080
like running unit tests.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.290
Those two tasks don't have any
dependency relationship, but

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.690
if we're running both we would really
like the unit test to be run before

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.530
the integration tests.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.980
To continue our morning routine example,
let's continue showering and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.599
putting on a fragrance like perfume or
cologne.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.380
Putting on a fragrance doesn't require
showering, and showering doesn't

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.450
require putting on a fragrance, but
if we're going to both take a shower and

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.700
also put on a fragrance,
we should really take the shower first.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.652
Let's create those tasks and
relationship between them.

00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:34.450
All right, so we've got our take shower
task, and we've got our put on fragrance

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.300
task along with the should
run after take shower.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.660
So now if we go back to Gradle, and we
say hey Gradle, run put on fragrance and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.980
take shower.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.440
Well, let's see what order they run in.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.960
Looks like they run in
the order that makes sense.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.860
First we take a shower,
then we put on the fragrance.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.250
Let's check out a few other things
we can do with task dependencies.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.540
We can depend on multiple tasks, note
this is one of those situations where

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.240
you do need to use the equal sign
when you're assigning to a property.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.860
Let's give this one a try.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.940
So since get ready depends on taking
shower, eating breakfast, and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.200
putting on shoes,
looks like we eat breakfast, and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.664
since breakfast is finalized by
brushing your teeth, we do that.

00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:20.320
We're going to put on our shoes, but
first we have to put on our socks.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.610
And then we take a shower?&nbsp;Whoops.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.180
Something's not right here.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.220
I think we need one more
ordering constraint.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.210
There's no dependency relationship
between taking a shower and putting on

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.800
shoes, but it certainly looks like if
we're going to both take a shower and

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.310
put on shoes, we should
probably take the shower first.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.880
Let's change that out.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.130
And there we go.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.233
We say to put on shoes,

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:42.207
you must run after take shower,
and now if we run this again,

00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:47.340
looks like we're doing things in
a more sensible order this time.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.990
One more advanced thing we can do is
look at all the tasks in a project and

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.720
decide which ones we want to depend on.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.560
Let's make a task called
getEquipped that depends on

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.240
every task that starts with putOn.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.820
So here's our get equipped task.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.690
And you'll see it depends on, and
then this is actually a list that was

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.580
created by looking at all
the other tasks in the project.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.415
You don't need to understand
how this works right now.

00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:15.275
The point is just to show off something
that would be extremely difficult or

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:17.204
impossible to do in other build tools.

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:18.154
Let's give it a try.

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:21.305
And we run get equipped, looks like we
put on a fragrance, we put on our socks,

00:04:21.305 --> 00:04:22.095
we put on our shoes.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:25.365
As always there's more information
to be found on task dependencies

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.365
in the course code.

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:26.865
