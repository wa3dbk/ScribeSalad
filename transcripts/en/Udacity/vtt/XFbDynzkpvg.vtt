Alright, cool, we've got this little Facebook looking thing going at the top.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.540
&gt;&gt; Yeap, so now we can not only you know, chat

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.320
with other people in our company, like collaborate on a stage,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.470
but we can follow the records. So if there are any

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.910
updates or post to it, it'll go straight to our feed.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.310
&gt;&gt; Cool, so I just added a stage as a friend basically.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.310
&gt;&gt;

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.600
[LAUGH]

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.590
More or less, Andy.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.530
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cool.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.410
&gt;&gt; Well, why don't you try writing something on

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.870
it. And just you know, seeing what that looks like.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.520
&gt;&gt; Alright.
