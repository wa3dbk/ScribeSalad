00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.780
Remember that a service is where you
would put view independent logic.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.000
At first, services seem very
similar to controllers,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.300
both of them provide
data to an application.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.050
A major difference is that services
are not intended for just one view.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.840
A service is not tied to
a specific controller but

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.980
can be used by any
number of controllers.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.920
For example, this user service has
information about the logged in user.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.500
And account controller
could use the user service

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.630
to supply data to its template and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.320
there's also the navigation controller
which needs the user information.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.380
The user service can be injected into
both controllers since it's just

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.330
a source of data and functionality.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.340
In our app we might want data from
the menu items to be displayed in other

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.790
locations.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.040
So let's generate a service to detangle
our menu data from this specific

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.980
controller and template.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.130
Then we'll see how we can
inject it into a controller.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.530
We can generate a service with
the Angular generator by running yo

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.820
angular service and
providing a name for the service.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.700
Well this should look familiar since it
starts out exactly like a controller.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.260
We get our apps module.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.580
Create a new service with a name.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.790
And then provide the function.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.960
Just like with controllers, when we call
service on the module, this name and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.200
function are being stored
with Angular's injector.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.610
When a controller asks for

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.269
service with this name, Angular knows
where it's located and how to create it.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.280
Since the food finder service will be
in charge of all menu information,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.580
let's move this data to a JSON file and
convert it to proper JSON.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.309
We'll use the food finder
service to fetch this file.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.780
Let's create a get menu function and
use jQuery to fetch the JSON file.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.480
So we've extracted the menu and
set up the service.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.370
Now we just need to hook the service and
the controller together.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.060
The format to inject a service into
a controller looks a little odd.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.990
So let's take it step by step.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.080
First I'll highlight
the entire function,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.390
then I'll copy it and delete it.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.260
To inject something into a controller
we need to pass an array of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.470
things to inject.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.295
So add an array, give the names of
the services we want to inject.

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:01.775
For now it's just a food finder service.

00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:04.995
Then pace the controller back in.

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:09.119
The service is now being injected
into the controller as an argument.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.890
To use the service though,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.940
the controller needs to
store it in a variable.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.100
So we'll add a variable
with the name menu here.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.350
To get the menu we need to call
foodfinder's getMenu function.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.850
Since getMenu uses jQuery,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.479
it returns a jQuery deferred
object similar to a promise.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.099
We call then, and when our data gets
returned, we can set it to this items.

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:40.047
Since the this keyword
is contextually based,

00:02:40.047 --> 00:02:43.910
this in here isn't
the same as this out here.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.770
We'll just use lexical
scope to fix this.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.210
Typically the variable vm for
view model is used.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.940
And we're still showing
the exact same information.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.620
But now the data is not
tied to this specific view.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.640
There's no limit to the number of
services that can be injected.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.580
Anything that needs to be injected
comes first in the array.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.340
Then the function that's receiving
everything comes at the end, and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.270
has variables for each injected service,
in the same order.
