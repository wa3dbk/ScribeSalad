00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's go over the answer together.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
First, we're going to define a procedure, named: t_identifier.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It takes a token as an argument.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the most important part of a token definition

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is always the regular expression,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
declaring the class of strings that it matches.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We definitely want to allow lower case letters.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We also want to allow upper case letters.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And you can't start with an underscore or a digit, so this is all, for now.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But after this, you could have more lower case letters,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
more upper case letters--or underscores--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and you can have as many of those as you want.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So there's our answer.
