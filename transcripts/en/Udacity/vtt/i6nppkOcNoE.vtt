00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.740
So, what's an example of a data visualization, that tells a subjective story,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.930
rather than an objective one.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.240
&gt;&gt; Sure, a popularly sited one is actually one that we have up here

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.350
which is one that Steve Jobs showed, and it's a 3D pie chart, and

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.090
It's confusing really when you kind of just look at it.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.190
Because, as you can see here, so the 19.5% represented by the green part of

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.100
the pie, visually if you didn't have those cues of the annotations.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.640
It looks to the eye almost the same size as the 39% here, and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.570
definitely larger than the 21.2%.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.830
And so it's just really confusing because pie charts can be a little confusing,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.100
especially in this way if it's 3D.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.010
Because it doesn't let the eye effectively take in the data.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.450
So it can be pretty confusing and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.800
let folks use graphs in a way that might be misleading or confusing.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.630
Especially if you aren't able to understand what the data behind it is.
