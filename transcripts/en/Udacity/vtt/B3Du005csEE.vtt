00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.800
When I get a compiler runtime error, the first thing I do is likely look at the

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.320
screen and say, darn, it why isn't this right? But I move forward and the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.680
second thing I do is tell myself, hey, you can fix this. You get this code, you

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.330
wrote this, you know where you can find the problem. So, I usually try to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.330
comment out certain areas of code or build use cases for it to try to narrow it

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.420
down. And then, solve the issue within that one part of the code. The third

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.670
thing I do is I usually get really frustrated by that point, two or three hours

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.410
later, and I say, I can't do this anymore. Where do I go? So, I try to look at

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.340
some documentation or I try to look at some tips. And I specifically go and ask

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.370
some friends for help. The fourth thing that I do is usually I probably solve

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.260
it by then. So, I give myself a pat on the back and say hey, you can do it.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.680
This is awesome. And I learn something, and I write it down. I take a mental

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.419
note of it so that next time I don't make that same mistake.
