00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.642
Sometimes a set of instructions is not an algorithm. This is a slight

00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:07.210
modification of the algorithm that Kai gave you before. Why is this not an

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.438
algorithm? Is it because the description is ambiguous? The description contains

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:16.543
steps that cannot be executed? Or the procedure does not always terminate? If

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:26.033
you'd like a hint, think about what happens if you apply this algorithm to this

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:29.587
pattern.
