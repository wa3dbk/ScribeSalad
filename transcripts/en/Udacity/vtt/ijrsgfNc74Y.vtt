00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.630
Although we use passwords almost
universally, very commonly,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.530
there are plenty of
problems with passwords.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.020
People been predicting
the demise of passwords for

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.880
a long time because of these problems,
but they sort of refuse to go away.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.930
So what are some of these problems?

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.530
For passwords to be strong, and
by strong we mean harder to guess,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.830
they need to be long and they need to
have these upper, lower digits, special

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.730
characters and things like that, so
we are increasing the space of possible

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.140
passwords but that increases complexity
for users and usability suffers.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.156
Even if you have good passwords,

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:40.620
there are problems with sort of the
trusted paths discussion that we had.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.150
This is sort of related to that.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.250
Phishing and social engineering attacks,
really users don't authenticate who is

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.775
really that their giving
their password to.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:51.355
So this idea of mutual authentication,

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:55.680
you trying to convince
that it is really you.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.730
It's Alice.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.820
Do you assume the system
is the true system?

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.920
Do you ever ask the system to
authenticate itself to you?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.250
In particular if you're using
a remote service, your bank or

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.560
something like that,
how do you know it's really your bank?

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.250
It could be someone else that
just looks like your bank.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.540
And those are the sort of
fphshing attacks that we have.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.560
Unfortunately once a password is stolen,
it can be used many times.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.530
Not a one time use sort of a thing, and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.400
they can gain access to your
account again and again.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.370
And the way we address that is
by having policies that say you

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.770
must change your password every 90 days,
or every six months, or whatever it is.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.070
Of course, usability's going
to suffer because of that.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.550
And finally, humans are humans, and

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.170
they have a hard time
remembering lots of passwords.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.640
These days it's not just
one system that we have.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.185
You have your bank, you have your mail,
you have various merchants,

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:55.540
retailers, and things like that, so
you have lots of passwords to remember.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.710
You don't want to have the same password
everywhere because when one gets

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.610
compromised, you're vulnerable to
all your services that you access,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.600
somebody can get to them with
that one stolen password.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.490
So if you're going to
have different passwords,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.850
well that's going It's going to be hard
for us to remember so many of those

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.930
passwords if they're really hard to
guess, and they're long and complex.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.340
Well all of the many problems,
there are of course,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.620
some best practices when
it comes to passwords.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.250
So when it comes to Sys administrators,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.620
obviously the password should
never be stored in the clear.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.720
So you only store hashed values.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.680
And we use salting, random salt,
to avoid the problems,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.650
multiple users having the same
password and things like that.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.260
We have to limit access to the file
where these passwords are stored,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.900
the hash values are stored, so
shadow files we talked about and so on.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.270
And we want to use a function
here that is not fast.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.490
We have to do it only once it's
in it once the user logs in.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.300
We don't need to run it a million times.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.820
So it doesn't have to be fast,
it can be slow.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.990
On the other hand,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.320
somebody doing a brute force attack
has to run it again and again.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.960
They have to run it millions of times.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.580
So using a slow function
actually is helpful, and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.960
current implementations
actually do that.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.590
They use slower hash functions.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.250
What users can do is,
a lot of password managers these days,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.020
we're talking about having
lot of passwords, one for

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.525
each different service you want to
use and hard to remember all of them.

00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:24.795
Password managers actually can
generate complex high entropy.

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:27.395
We didn't talk about
the word entropy but

00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:32.197
entropy is sort of high entropy means
it's harder to guess, so they can

00:03:32.197 --> 00:03:35.977
have these difficult to guess passwords
and they can keep track of those.

00:03:35.977 --> 00:03:40.317
You basically have one strong password
to access the password manager and

00:03:40.317 --> 00:03:42.347
they can keep track of
your other passwords.
