00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.620
Let's look at how the camera model and

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.770
the perspective of the camera model is extracted from this.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.380
We can actually simplify this a little bit.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.510
What I can do is now take the focal length which was on this side and actually

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.980
just start saying is, okay, let's mirror it on the front side of this too.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.010
Which basically means is now I can move the sensor here, and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.790
if I move the sensor here I can put the x i and y i values on this side.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.240
And one interesting aspect of this simplification is now I

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.680
can see the image to be also upright as the object is.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.640
Of course you notice that if this object was farther away,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.340
the image would be smaller.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.600
If the object was closer, the image would be larger.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.710
And that's exactly what we notice when we were looking at,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.650
of course, lenses and how the impact of lenses with moving objects was.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.140
Again, this is a idealized version.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.150
Pinhole is this point here.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.410
We would be replacing this with a lens.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.660
We looked at these equations before this is how we would compute the values of

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.340
both x and y put in each and every object the location of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.860
the pixel that would be related to of course where this point is on the scene.
