00:00:00.022 --> 00:00:02.270
Okay, let's have a quiz on communication patterns.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.289
I'm going to give you a bunch of code snippets and I'm going to ask you to label them

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:07.790
according to the parallel communication pattern that they embody.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.430
For each code snippet, you should indicate whether it is a map operation, a gather operation,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.618
a scatter operation, a stencil operation, or a transpose operation.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:20.365
Here's the code, and this is really sort of pseudo code.

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:22.388
I'm not explaining where these variables came from,

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:25.562
or showing you that how many threads I'm watching, or anything like that.

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:30.228
But this is kernel code, and as you can see, I have two variables, out and in.

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:32.189
These are arrays, the floating point numbers.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.970
And just for berevity, I've created two variables, i and j, to represent thread Idx.x, and thread Idx.y.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.888
Just to have something to do, I'm going to multiply a bunch of numbers by pi.

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:47.803
So I define pi here, and here are our code snippets. Out i equals pi times in.

00:00:47.803 --> 00:00:53.938
Out i plus j times 128 equals in j times, j plus i times 128.

00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:59.299
And then, you see these 2 I have guarded with an if statement, but only the odd threads get executed.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:07.001
Out i minus 1 plus equals pi times in i, out i plus 1 plus equals pi times in i.

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:15.155
Finally, out i equals in i plus in i minus 1 plus in i plus 1 times pi divided by 3.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.528
So for each of these statements, each of these little code snippets

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:22.688
indicate whether it's a map, a gather, a scatter, a stencil, or a transpose.
