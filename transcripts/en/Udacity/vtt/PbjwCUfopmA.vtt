00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.988
A while back, the person class had the ability to return the number of friends

00:00:02.988 --> 00:00:07.060
someone has. We printed the number of friends like this, which works pretty

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.000
well most of the time. But what if you only have one friend? It would print

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.422
out, this person has 1 friends. If you want a program to look professional and

00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:19.194
have output with good grammar, you often need to have the plural form and the

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:24.725
singular form of a word. We're going to tackle that problem in a minute. But in

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:28.625
preparation, let's write a word class with a method for figuring out if a

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:34.230
letter is a consonant or a vowel. Here's the word class. It saves its letters

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.943
in an instance variable, letters. The is vowel method takes in an index, and

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:45.245
then checks to see if the letter at that index is an a. You've probably noticed

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.170
that this method implementation doesn't really match the description of the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.850
method. isVowel should recognize a, e, i, o, and u. Call y a consonant for now.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.109
This isConsonant method is completely empty at the moment. It's your turn. Fix

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.300
the condition in isVowel and implement the isConsonant method. Here's a hint,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.405
you shouldn't need to do 21 checks to implement isConsonant.
