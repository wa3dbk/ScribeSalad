The final type of memory loss that we're going to discuss is termed

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:07.990
absentmindedness. This is a form of forgetting that results from inattention.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.222
Divided attention can lead to absentmindedness. So, if you're watching TV and

00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:15.150
talking to a friend at the same time, that's going to lead to poor encoding of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.222
either the content on the television show or the conversation you're having

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:23.624
with your friend. We're much less likely to remember things. If we're

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:27.894
multitasking. Now, again, it's really important to remember here that the more

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.954
we pay attention to what we're doing, the more likely we are to encode the

00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:35.872
information correctly and retrieve it when necessary. So all those teachers

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:39.129
that told you you needed to pay attention, they weren't lying.
