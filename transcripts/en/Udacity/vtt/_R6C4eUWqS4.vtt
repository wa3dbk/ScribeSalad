See, as Susan is right, but to me language learning is as much about the brain,

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:11.220
as it is about imitation and reward reinforcement. So for instance, humans

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.559
after all learned thousands and thousands of rules of grammar without ever

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.820
knowing they even have learned them. So reward and reinforcement can't be the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.727
only explanation. Now of course, we also need input from culture and the

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:28.896
environment to learn languages. After all, we learn specific languages. So in

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:33.854
that way, Susan and I agree. Learning language is more nature and nurture than

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:36.010
it is nature or nurture.
