00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.700
What makes good notification?

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.840
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.040
So a lot of times when I teach people
about the hook model, they say, okay,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.130
I get the trigger phase,
we need to prompt people to action, but

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.060
how do we make sure that
we don't spam people?

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.160
How do we know we're not sending them
too many of these triggers that they

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.610
become ineffective?

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.390
And there's a secret here.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.530
The secret is that we have to
closely couple the external trigger,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.400
the notification,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
the message that tells the user what
to do with the internal trigger.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.410
The internal trigger is this situation,
the emotion, the routine,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.480
the place, whatever it is that prompts
the user to act on their own accord.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.920
So the closer we can couple
these two things, right?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.260
The closer we can couple
the notification with the sensation or

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.180
the urge of this is
what I need in my day.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.260
That's magic.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.990
That's the difference between magic and
SPAM, is context.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.700
So that's the key.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.870
If you can closely couple those two,
and that, of course,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.430
starts with an examination, doing a bit
of a narrative on your user to figure

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.680
out when are they most likely to need
this product throughout their day.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.060
So don't just willy-nilly send
them notifications all day long.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.519
But couple those
notifications with a time and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.640
place when your user is most likely
to actually need the solution.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.410
&gt;&gt; So there's a delightful moment and
you couple it with authentication.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.900
&gt;&gt; Right.
Well it's a moment when

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.020
the user has this need.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.650
So for example, let's say I'm building
an app that plays music, right?

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.010
A music service or
a news service, right?

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.190
A great time to couple that need
is when I had the existing habit

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.315
of turning on my radio.

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:28.850
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.290
&gt;&gt; So if you could use geolocation or
other data or time of day data, or

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.070
appointment calendar information,
something that the user can tell you

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.830
about how they behave day to day, so
that you can appropriately target that

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.810
trigger at the moment in time
where it feels like magic.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.830
Wow, I was just about
to turn on my radio,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.200
I think I'll use this app instead.
