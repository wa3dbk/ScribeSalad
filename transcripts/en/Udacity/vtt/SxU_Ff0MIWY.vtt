00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.240
Here, the answer is 3 times the 6 root of a squared b to the 5th c to the 4th,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.923
all divided by b squared, c squared. That's amazing algebra work, if you got

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:13.510
any of that correct. Just like in our last problem, we want to increase the

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.986
power of each of these factors, so that way they're divisible by 6. This means

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:21.570
we need to change a to the 4th and to a to the 6th, b to the 7th, and to b to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.595
the 12th, and c to the 8th, and c to the 12th, as well. This means we need to

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:32.113
multiply it by 6th root of a squared b to the 5th, c to the 4th. We know this,

00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:35.772
since a to the 4th times a squared is a to the 6th, b to the 7th times b to the

00:00:35.772 --> 00:00:42.338
5th is b to the 12th. And c to the 8th times c to the 4th is c to the 12th. We

00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:47.324
multiply our numerators together, leaving 3a in front of our radical. Next, we

00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:52.138
simplify our denominator as a, b squared, c squared. We just divide each of

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:56.645
these powers by 6. And finally, we reduce a power of a, since a divided by a

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:02.879
equals 1. This leaves us with our final answer. And notice that a denominator

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.412
does not contain a 6 root anymore. Great work.
