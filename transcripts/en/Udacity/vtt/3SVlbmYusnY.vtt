00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.090
These methods are literally just the tip of the iceberg

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.250
when it comes to data amputation. I wanted to make

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.890
sure that you were exposed to the concept, but there

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.850
are much more robust and sophisticated methods to fill in missing

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.070
values in your data. Filling in the missing values on

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.410
a data set by computing the mean of the field in

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.290
question, or fitting a linear model, are somewhat effective and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.670
simplistic methods, but they can both have negative side effects and

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.840
amplify or attenuate preexisting trends in your data.
