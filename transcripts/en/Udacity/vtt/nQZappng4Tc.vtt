00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.610
So here's the answer. The result of the first expression

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.930
is always 0. No matter what string s is, we

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.000
always find s at the beginning of itself. So, if

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.940
we think of s as any string. If we search for

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.300
the string hello, in hello, well, we're going to find hello

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.230
at the beginning of hello, and that's position 0, that's

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.000
what fun will return, no matter what string s is,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.170
the result of s.find s will always be 0. The result

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.860
of s.find passing in the string s, will only

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.550
be 0, if s started with the letter s. So

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.930
this is not always true. The third example always is

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.200
true, so here we have the string s, that's a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.510
string with one character s, and what we're trying

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.770
to find in it is the string s. Well, we

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
find that at position 0. So that's the result find

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.550
we'll produce. The fourth one gets a little more tricky.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.100
So here we're looking in the string s. We're looking for the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.280
empty string. Remember the definition of find says it will give us

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.460
the first occurrence where that string appears. Well the empty string appears

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.700
in s. We don't actually see it, but it's there. We found

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.630
the empty string. There's no string there no matter what s is.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.650
We can find the empty string in it, because we don't need

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.860
any string to find the empty string. So the result of s.find

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.630
passing an empty string, will always be 0, no matter what the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.815
string s is. So the final one is also always

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:21.440
0. And the reason for this, is when we search

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.890
in s for the string s plus ! ! , well, no matter what s is. So even if it

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.870
was a string that already included ! ! . So

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.640
let's suppose that's the value of s. What we're trying

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.230
to find is now s plus ! ! . So

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.030
that's going to be what we had before, plus three more

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.780
exclamation points. Searching for that within the string s

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.030
will never be found. And we know it can't be

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.750
found because this string is actually longer than the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.440
string s that we started with. So the result of

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.830
this expression is always going to be -1. That means

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.540
the string was never found. We add 1 to that,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.660
we get 0. That's why this expression will always evaluate

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.800
to 0, no matter what the value of s is.
