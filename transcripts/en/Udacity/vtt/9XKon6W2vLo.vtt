00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's try a simple exercise. See the object in

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.380
the photo? That's a strange looking object. So let's see

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.790
if you can figure out how it can be

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.830
used simply by what you can see and infer from

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.910
the photograph. Here are some possibilities. This doesn't exhaust

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.150
the possibilities. Think of some yourself, and type them in

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
the box below. Maybe it's an upside down candle

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.520
holder and it can be moved by those three handles.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.230
Or, maybe it's a decorative flowerpot. Oh, it, it's, it's

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.600
a cup for a three-handed person. Or, maybe it's pottery made

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.710
by a drunk. You know, as William Shakespeare said, it's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.630
made by an idiot full of sounds and fury signifying nothing.
