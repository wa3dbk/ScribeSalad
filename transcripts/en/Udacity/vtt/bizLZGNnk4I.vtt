00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.110
Let's do a quick comparison of switches and routers.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.930
Switches typically operate at layer two. A common protocol at

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.930
layer two is ethernet. Switches are typically automatically configuring

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.890
and forwarding tends to be quite fast, since packets only

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.280
need to be processed through layer two on flat

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.130
look ups. Routers, on the other hand, typically operate at

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.651
layer three where IP is the common protocol. And

00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:25.970
router level topologies are not restricted to a spanning tree.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.580
One can even have multipath routing, where a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.970
single packet could be sent along one of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.160
multiple possible paths in the underlying router level

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.830
topology. So, in many ways ethernet, or layer two

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.470
switching, is a lot more convenient, but one

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.670
of the major limitations is broadcast. The spanning

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.720
tree protocol messages and ARP queries both impose

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.230
a fairly high load on the network. So this

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.570
raises the question of whether it's possible to

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.460
get many of the benefits of the auto configuration

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.440
and fast forwarding of layer two without facing

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.160
these broadcast limitations. As it turns out, there are

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.790
ways to strike this balance. And in the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.330
third part of the course, when we talk about

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.950
network management, we will look at some ways

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.120
to scale Ethernet to very large topologies. For example,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.270
in data center networks. We'll also explore

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.130
how an emerging technology called Software Define

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.030
Networking, or SDN, is effectively blurring the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.470
boundary between the layer two and layer three.
