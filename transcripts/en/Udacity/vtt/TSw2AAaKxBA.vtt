00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.443
&gt;&gt; The value at which the frequency is highest is called the mode. And this

00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:09.500
certainly works in describing the distribution. In the case of a histogram, the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.214
mode would be this bin right here, and this bin right here. The most common

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:19.113
value is the mode. And, in this case, we can't see individual values, but we can

00:00:19.113 --> 00:00:23.884
see that most of the values rest within this bin. So, the mode occurs here, and

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:29.035
here. The value in the middle of the distribution is called the median. And this

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:34.046
would also work. We'll go more into depth later. And finally, the average is a

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:39.357
statistic that rests at a specific spot in the middle of the distribution. We're

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:44.702
going to elaborate on this in this lesson. The value where the frequency is the

00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:49.854
lowest, in this case, it's right here. And it looks to be about 72 or 75. And

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:55.498
this most definitely would not represent the whole distribution where there are

00:00:55.498 --> 00:01:00.860
a lot of scores here, more towards 50. And the biggest value on the x-axis,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.834
again, that's here at about 75. Here, probably the biggest value is somewhere

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:12.840
around 90. And that doesn't represent the whole distribution so let's ignore

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.250
these two. But we know that the mode, median, and average can all help describe

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.027
the distributions. They each have strengths and weaknesses, and we'll explore

00:01:23.027 --> 00:01:25.112
all of these throughout this lesson.
