So sleep is actually a really organized process. Throughout the night, our

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:08.792
brain cycles between what we call rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep and

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:16.370
non-REM sleep so not rapid eye movement sleep. Non-REM sleep Has four stages.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.922
When we fall a sleep we go down to stage I, then to, three and four. Again,

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:26.318
this is our deepest sleep. But then when we cycle back up we go from four to

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:30.223
three to two and once we get back to one we go into rapid eye movement

00:00:30.223 --> 00:00:36.512
sleep,and this is where dreams occur. Now, rapid eye movement sleep is exactly

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:39.440
what it sounds like, your eyes move back and forth really, really rapidly

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.794
underneath your eyelids. It's interesting to note that our electricity activity

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:49.038
during REM sleep looks pretty similar to when we're awake. Now, this whole

00:00:49.038 --> 00:00:52.995
cycle lasts about 90 minutes. This means that about 25 percent of our sleep we

00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:57.868
spend in rapid eye movement sleep. And 75 percent we spend outside of rapid eye

00:00:57.868 --> 00:00:59.510
movement sleep.
