00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.652
So I know that words that end with s or o need to have an es added. So if the

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:11.159
last letter is o, or the last letter is s, I return letters plus es. This

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:15.022
condition is pretty ugly. And it seems like I'm going to be talking about the

00:00:15.022 --> 00:00:20.930
last letter index a lot. So I'm going to declare a variable. And now I can

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.775
replace all of these with just last. That looks a bit better. Let's see if our

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.290
program works for this case now. I'll need to return something in the else

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.665
clause. Since just adding an S seemed to be sort of a default leftover case,

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:41.379
I'll just return letters plus S here. I'll run my word tester. We want to look

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.706
at the cases that end with O or S. For example, kisses. It looks like right

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:51.952
now, our actual value for kisses matches what we expected. It looks like we

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:55.600
also got some for free. All of the leftover default cases where you just add an

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.954
s, are working pretty well right now. Massages look good, judges looks good,

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:06.572
laps, cats, clocks. But there are some that still aren't working, and dishes

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:13.251
should be disches, and not dish. So let's go back to our word. The case for y

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:15.875
being the last letter was a little bit more complicated, because it mattered

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:20.778
whether there was a consonant before it, or a vowel before it. So let's add a

00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:25.520
case for when the last letter is y. We need to account for two possibilities.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.248
If the second to last letter is a consonant, we take off the y and add yes. We

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:39.044
can use substring to cut off the last letter, which is the y. And then add back

00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:46.905
ies. Otherwise, if the letter before the y is a vowel, we just add s. Now it

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:51.150
should be better. If I go back to my word tester, and run it one more time. It

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:59.127
should work for cherries, which it does. And it hasn't broken. Boys, or days,

00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:07.004
which also ended in y. So that's a good sign. Still not working well for

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:11.779
dishes, or witches. It looks like if it ends in an h, then we need to return

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:17.881
the letters with an es instead of just s. Let's check that. It looks like

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:23.722
dishes is right, now. Witches is also looking better. Judges, laps, cats,

00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:30.018
clocks, these all look good. But bathes isn't right now. Bathes just turned

00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:34.684
into bathes. I think we need an exception for when there's a t before the h. So

00:02:34.684 --> 00:02:40.514
let's go back and do that. If the last letter is H, then if is the 2nd to last,

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:51.590
so if the 2nd to last letter is an S or a C, then we add ES. Otherwise, just S.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.560
And now, they should all match. So it looks like it works. But can we simplify

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.590
the code at all? The code I just wrote was pretty complicated. Now that you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.640
have a working version, you could spend 5 minutes trying to simplify the code.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.620
You can check whether your simplifications work by running the tester again.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.304
And if you get a very simple or very short version, compare it with another

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:15.093
short version that I'm going to post in the forum. There should be a link

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:16.592
somewhere on the page.
