00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.940
To answer this question we need to know the number of

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.730
users who did check in using mobile and the total number of

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.790
users in our sample. Now I could have just used these two

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.890
numbers and divided them, but I want to do this programmatically. To

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.570
do that I can take the sum of my mobile check

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.290
in variables when it's equal to one. And then divide that by

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.040
the length of that vector. This is how many users are in

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.638
our sample. Running that code I can see that I get about

00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:30.430
64.5%, or 64.6%. Rounding to the nearest percent, that's just

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.370
65. Now that's over half of the users in the data

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.330
set, so it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.500
to continue the development of the mobile experience. At least based

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.750
on this sample data set. So when you're answering questions,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.140
it's important not to just think about what kind of data

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.850
you're looking at but maybe what types of transformations you can

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.280
make to the variables themselves. Sometimes you want raw counts, and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.940
other times you just want a binary yes or no, did a

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.160
user use this. It's important to think about what kind of data you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.260
need to answer a specific question. So not every sort of transformation

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.080
you do has to be a functional transformation like square root or log.
