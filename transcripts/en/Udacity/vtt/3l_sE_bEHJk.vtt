A review, which can also be called an inspection or

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.500
a walkthrough, is a systematic reading of a software development artifact.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.040
Reviews can be a cost-effective way of finding defects in the artifact, and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.260
reviews complement other verification techniques such as testing and proofs.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.440
That is, they find, tend to find problems that the other techniques don't find.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.880
The purpose of a review is to detect defects, which, depending on the artifact,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.250
might be called bugs or faults.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.950
Reviews may also be used to check adherence to corporate or

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.380
governmental standards.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
Reviews should not be used to educate staff members, report status or

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.350
fix the detected problems.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.170
Reviews can be applied to different kinds of artifacts produced during

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.540
the software development.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.430
These include requirements documents, specifications, architectural designs,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.639
detail designs, new code, fixes, test plans, and documentation itself.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.960
Effective reviews are systematic.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.580
It is not sufficent, sufficient to just have a meeting and

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.760
talk about an artifact.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.110
People's time is expensive and group meetings are especially so.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.800
Here are the recommended steps to take for an effective review.
