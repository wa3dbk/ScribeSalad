00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.350
My understanding of the main difference
between a unicorn investor and

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.000
sort of a long tail investor is
a unicorn investor is looking for

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.200
other investors to pile on.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.950
That's where they make their money.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.810
So, a first investor in a unicorn
company will say, hey, you know what,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.670
I think this could be sold
as a billion dollar company.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.540
I'm going to put in enough money to
make the valuation a billion dollars.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.931
That sets off a press cycle.

00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:24.398
That press cycle is a feeding frenzy for

00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:27.029
other investors who
want to also pile on.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.045
And as those other investors pile on,
the first investor is actually reaping

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:34.410
the benefits of these
other additional pile ons.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.020
But that whole business model of
investors feeding on investors

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.880
is dependent on no drop in valuation,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.130
which requires continued growth with
the company that's been invested in,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.190
either in the technology space,
the people space, the market space,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.490
some metric that they consider
important has to keep getting bigger or

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.030
more valuable, even though it's only
perceived value, the whole business can

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
fall apart if the true value of
the company is never realized.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.110
This is where tech bubbles
come from actually.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.580
Now in the long tail investor side of
things, those investors are actually

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.710
interested in legitimately
helping Bootstrap companies and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.310
make them successful and

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.360
sustainable because they see the
sustained long term value of investing

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.130
in a spread of different businesses
that will be around in 20 or 50 years.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.200
It's that continued growth but

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.760
slowly without that get rich
quick kind of mentality.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.170
Those are the investors actually I
prefer because it actually benefits

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.860
society and is a good place for
you to put your business trust.
