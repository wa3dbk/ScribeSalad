00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.508
I give you three more examples from that day.

00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:05.080
Because at some point, we got from 247.6 to

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.346
247.55, some other time 242.5 to 240.0 and then

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:14.437
we got from 205.71 to 201: all within a

00:00:14.438 --> 00:00:16.155
fraction of a second. I’m just going to ask

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.483
you the same question as before, do you

00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:20.943
consider these abnormal, relative

00:00:20.943 --> 00:00:24.000
to this confidence interval over here?
