Here I have my set of counting numbers from 1 to 7 and my even numbers between 1

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:08.230
and 9. We're going to write these sets inside of circles so you can better

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:12.185
visualize them. Here I have my set C of numbers, and here I have my set E of

00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:16.425
numbers. I've drawn my two sets in overlapping circles, or a Venn Diagram. All

00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:20.665
the elements of C have been placed inside this circle and all the elements of E

00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:25.809
have been placed inside this circle. What's neat about each of these sets is we

00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:31.047
can actually make one giant set, called the union. To find the union, we want

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.031
any element that's in set C or in set E, in any of the circles. The union is

00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:40.940
represented by this upward U symbol, so what set do you think is C union E?
