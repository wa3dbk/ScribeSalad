00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.944
The solutions to this quadratic equation are negative 1 and positive 5. Nice

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:09.315
work if you got these two answers. When we factor this quadratic, we know the

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:15.431
first terms in each binomial must be x, since x times x equals x squared. Now

00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:20.415
we want to find factors of negative 5 that sum to negative 4. Those factors are

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:24.909
negative 5 and positive 1. Next, we set each factor equal to 0 and then we

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:31.533
solve for x. So, x can equal positive 5, or x can equal negative 1.
