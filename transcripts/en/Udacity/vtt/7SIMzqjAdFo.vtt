00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.256
As we can tell from each of the graphs over here, the vertical asymptote of all

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:09.790
functions of this form, is the y-axis. X equals 0. That's why this value, x

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.679
equals 0, is not part of the domain of this function.
