00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.457
We know each side weighed 8 pounds each. Then we added 100 pounds to both sides,

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:09.014
so we have 108 pounds on both sides, so they must weigh the same. Not only can I

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:13.534
add 100 pounds to both sides of the scale, I could also think about removing 100

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:17.928
pounds from both sides of the scale. If I remove 100 pounds from both sides of

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.988
the scale, then I'd be back at 8 pounds. 8 pounds on the left and 8 pounds on

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.534
the right. This is one of the most important concepts in algebra. We want to be

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:31.838
able to add a number to both sides of an equation and subtract a number from

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.270
both sides of an equation. It's the Properties of Equality. If you chose the

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:37.611
last answer, nice work.
