00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
One of the greatest things that could happen to a startup is a large company says,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.840
"Hey! I want to invest in you, and I'm really interested in doing something with you guys."

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.680
"We just don't want to be a supplier or a joint venture;

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.470
"we want to put money into your company."

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.390
And I get all the time entrepreneurs who are going, "Yay! Look!"

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.690
"So-and-so is really interested in investing in our company. What a great idea!"

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.310
It is a great idea, but you really need to put on your green eyeshades

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
and black armbands and roll up your sleeves and really think through here

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.440
what's in it for you versus what's in it for them.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
Obviously, if you're a technology-driven company,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.810
the first thing they want is access to your technology.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.260
Congratulations.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.510
But you know, their objectives are not to make you a large company.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.990
Their objective is to make them a larger company.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.320
So you need to understand what kind of deals do they want.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.820
"Oh, we want most favored nations clause,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.430
"which means if you sign a deal with anybody else, we always want a better deal."

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.970
Or my favorite is, "We want an exclusive for a year."

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.080
Now, all these things sound great from the large company's perspective,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.970
but the question to ask yourself is, "What do they do for me building my business?"

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.460
And I always turn to large companies and turn this around and I'd say,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.410
"You want a 1-year exclusive or you want most favored nations."

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.570
"It sounds like you actually want to buy us without actually spending the money,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.400
"because my goal is not to be a small subsidiary of your engineering department,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.040
"my goal is to build a company your size."

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.170
"And so we need to understand what's in it for both of us."

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.690
And so I tend to try to understand, first of all, who's the sponsor and what's the motivation?

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.750
And it needs to come from the business side, not just some technology people,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.490
and you can't be dealing with junior biz dev people ultimately

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.760
because their first offers are always, "One-year exclusives, and we need all these other things."

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.479
And while that's great for them because they have their checklist,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.590
you need to be prepared to walk away.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.540
But if you understand who the sponsor is, you could actually have an adult conversation,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.960
saying, "Listen. This doesn't work for me."

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.610
"Actually, what you want me to do is to be selling to your competitors

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.810
"because that's the only way I could grow more resources to make you successful."

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.580
"I'm happy to consider how you get an advantage,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.270
"but you can't decide I'm your only supplier."

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.980
So one of the ways I tend to deal with these is try to get sales deals, not investments.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.750
That is, to me it's a lot better to get a $10 million order from a company

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.900
than a $10 million ownership position that they take

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.730
because now they're your boss as well.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.920
Or try to offer warrants--that is, essentially options on buying stock--

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.390
based on sales success.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.250
Remember, while it might feel great to have name of big company next to yours

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.410
for the first year, eventually this will be a lead weight unless it turns into revenue.
