00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.560
The answer should look something like this. Should be, the

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.610
HTML is, and then we have our opening b tag, the

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.230
words, reasonably straightforward, and then our closing b tag. It's also

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.750
possible to do this, and I didn't, I wasn't super clear

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.570
when I gave you the problem, that you could put a

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.240
b tag just around the word reasonably and just around the

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.720
word straightforward. But, obviously it's easier if you put it around

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.750
just the whole phrase and, you know, then you only need

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.830
one element instead of two.
