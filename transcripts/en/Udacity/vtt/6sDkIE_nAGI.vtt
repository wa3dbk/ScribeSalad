00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.310
The example we're looking at here, is an

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.650
automobile info box, in particular for the Tesla Model

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.760
S. In this lesson, we're going to use info

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.510
box data throughout our examples, involving Mongo DB. So,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.800
let's take a look at the data that's

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.800
represented in this info box. Manufacturer, we have production

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.590
years, model years. Several different assembly plants, a designer,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.750
class, body style, with 2 elements, 5 door and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.030
liftback, and a number of other fields. So what

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.770
I'd like to do here, is talk about how

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.800
we might model this data in MongoDB, as documents

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.890
using the JSON like syntax I mentioned earlier. So in

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.930
modeling this data, let's start with some of the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.890
scalar valued fields that are here. Here we can see

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.400
scalar fields for manufacturer, class, and body style. We

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.870
can also model a couple of array fields here for

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.190
production, model years, and layout. So here,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.920
in our Json like syntax, for MongoDB, we've

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.040
modeled that same data, using array value fields.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.630
Now, we could model the designer field, as

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.490
just a single string. But to show an alternative, we might also model it as

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.920
a simple person document, as follows. And here

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.630
we have a document with a designer field

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.580
that has a nested document within it, for the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.470
designer. And last, putting the idea of array fields

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.370
and embedded documents together. We might represent the assembly

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.400
data in this example, like this, with an assembly

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.790
field that has an array, containing embedded documents for

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.900
each of the assembly plants. So, in Mango DB,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.520
our entire document for the Tesla Model S might

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.740
look something like this. With a mixture of fields that

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.670
are scalars, array valued and embedded documents. One

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.255
of the many cool things about this, is that

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:50.450
Mongo DB natively supports a very common big

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.560
data format, that being JSON. And by support I

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.220
mean, that we can store data items structured

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.110
this way in our database and do queries that

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.130
would say, for example, identify all documents where the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.840
city of assembly is Fremont. Driving down the hierarchy,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.190
to actually pull out matches for this piece of data,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.220
even though it's nested several layers deep within an individual document.
