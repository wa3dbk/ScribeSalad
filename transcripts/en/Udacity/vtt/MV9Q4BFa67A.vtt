00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.354
So this is a pretty tough question--I hope you were able to solve it.

00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:05.277
There are lots of different ways to solve this.

00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:09.000
I'll start by working out one way on the sketchpad,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then we'll see a few different ways to solve it in the Python Interpreter.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So I'm going to call the 3 inputs "a", "b", and "c".

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We can call them anything we want,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and since they're not meaningful numbers,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
might as well just use the first 3 letters.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So one way to solve it is to have a big, complicated, nested "if" statement.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we're going to have several comparisons.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
First, we want to check if "a" is greater than "b".

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If "a" is greater than "b"--well "a" might be the biggest,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but we don't know yet; we still have to check if "a" is greater than "c".

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.585
So we need 2 "ifs" and the important thing

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.000
to notice about the 2 "ifs"--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the comparison, "a greater than c" is indented inside the "if a is greater than b".

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So this will only happen when "a" is greater than "b".

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That means if "a" is greater than "b" and "a" is greater than "c",

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"a" is the biggest, so we can return "a".

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If it's not--well, now we've got the case where "a" was greater than "b".

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
"a" is not greater than "c", so that means "c" is greater than or equal to "a".

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So now we know that "c" is the biggest since "c" is bigger

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or as big as "a" and "a" is bigger than "b".

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So now we can return "c".

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So when this is not True, we know that "c" is greater than or equal to "a",

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.415
and we know that "a" is greater than "b" because this test

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:22.000
evaluated it to True.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we know it's correct to return "c".

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, we want an "else" that corresponds to this condition,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
so here if "a" is greater than "b", we evaluated this code.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
If "a" is not greater than "b",

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
well that means we have: "b" is greater than or equal to "a".

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And in this case, we want to check whether "b" is greater than "c"

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so we need another "if"--I'm going to use "if b is greater than c".

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now we know that "b" is greater than "c".

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
"b" was greater than or equal to "a" because we went to the "else" here.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So that means we can return "b".

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If not--well then, we know "b" is greater than or equal to "a",

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and "c" is greater than or equal to "b",

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
which is greater than or equal to "a".

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.369
So that means "c" is the biggest.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.000
We should return "c".

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.708
So here we have a definition of "biggest".

00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:15.000
It's pretty complicated.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We have 3 different "if" statements.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The main one that starts by comparing "a" and "b",

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.723
and then within that, we compare "a" and "c".

00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:27.554
Then we have the "else,"

00:02:27.554 --> 00:02:29.831
and within the else, we compare "b" and "c."

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:32.446
Whenever we have lots of nested "if" expressions--

00:02:32.446 --> 00:02:34.754
and certainly, we can have more than this amount,

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:37.000
but this is already getting to be enough to be confusing.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.615
We should try to think if there's a clearer way to do this,

00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:42.000
a way to make the code smaller and simpler,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
easier to understand--and if it's easier to understand,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that means it's also easier to write it correctly.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So the easier way to write this would be to use the "bigger" procedure

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that we defined earlier in this unit.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And if we remember what that was, we defined "bigger" like this:

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
"bigger" took 2 inputs, it compares them: if "a" is greater than "b",

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
it returns "a".

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If not, well then "b" is bigger--or at least equally big--

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
so we can return "b".

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So if we have "bigger" defined, which we already did,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
then we can define "biggest" in a much simpler way.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We don't need all these "ifs".

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
All we need to do is use "bigger" twice.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So if we remember that we have the "biggest" procedure,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
well then we can think about "biggest" this way.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So we've got 3 inputs coming into "biggest",

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and it should produce 1 output--the biggest of those 3.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Well, we've got the "bigger" procedure

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so we could use "bigger" to compare two.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
If we put "a" and "b" into "bigger"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the output here is going to be the bigger of "a" and "b".

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
To know the biggest of the 3--well now we need to compare that one

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
with "c", so the inputs to this ""bigger" procedure

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
will be the result of "bigger" of "a" and "b"

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and the input, "c".

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And the output of that will be the biggest of the three.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So this is composing 2 calls to "bigger".

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We want the inputs to the first call to be "a" and "b".

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We want the output of that call to be one of the inputs to the next call.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So here's how we can do that, in code.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We can return the result directly,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and the result will be the result of "bigger"--

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and this is the last "bigger".

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
When we do composition,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.262
we need to think about the function that we actually do last

00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:29.000
coming first because that one needs the inputs of the other ones.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.877
So the input to this call to "bigger", it has 2 inputs.

00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:38.000
It has the result of this one, which took "a" and "b" as its inputs.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So that's what's here,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
taking in "a" and "b", producing this output.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
That's one of the inputs, and then the second input to "bigger" is "c".

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So that's a much shorter way to write "biggest".

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.231
It takes advantage of the fact that we already

00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:55.000
defined a procedure that does this for 2 inputs.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And now we want to do the "biggest" for 3 inputs.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.262
There's actually an even easier way to do it,

00:05:00.262 --> 00:05:02.092
and that's using a built-in operator.

00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:06.000
There's a built-in operator, "max", and we could use "max" directly

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.215
to implement "bigger", just returning the "max" of a, b, and c.

00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:11.477
If we actually knew about the built-in operator, "max"--

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.000
well then, we wouldn't need to find "biggest" at all.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.877
We could just use the built-in "max".

00:05:15.877 --> 00:05:19.400
But the important thing to see here is that we can define procedures ourselves.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.000
And, in fact, we've seen enough at this point

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that every built-in procedure in Python,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
you could actually define yourself.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.415
And it's even better than that,

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:30.092
that you actually know enough at this point,

00:05:30.092 --> 00:05:32.354
that you could write every possible computer program,

00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:34.185
using just the things that we've seen.

00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:36.231
And this is a pretty astounding result,

00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:38.000
and I mean this in a very strong sense,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.569
that everything that could be computed mechanically

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.000
by any machine can be described using a program

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that only used the things that we've seen so far.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
All you need is procedures, simple arithmetic

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
with the comparisons, and "if" statements.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And this is a pretty amazing thing.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
This was shown by Alan Turing, back in the 1930s.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Alan Turing is probably the most important computer scientist.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.354
In the 1930s, he developed an abstract model of the computer

00:06:03.354 --> 00:06:05.000
which we now know as the "Turing Machine".

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.215
And he proved that that machine, with a very few simple operations,

00:06:08.215 --> 00:06:10.000
could simulate any other machine.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I should point out that Alan Turing was doing this back in the 1930s,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
when there weren't computers like we think of today.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.554
In the 1930s, what someone thought a computer was

00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:20.462
was a human who did calculations,

00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:23.000
and they did calculations in a mechanical way,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
following steps such as what you might have learned in grade school

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to do long division or long arithmetic.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Alan Turing showed that a very simple model

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
was enough to capture everything that a mechanical computer could do,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
whether it was a human computer or a modern computer

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that operates electronically, like we think of today.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Following World War II, he worked at Bletchley Park.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
This was the headquarters where all the

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
British efforts to break the Nazi encryptions were done.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Alan Turing lead the effort there to break the Enigma Code.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Enigma was the most widely used cypher code by the Nazis.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And Alan Turing built machines that could be used to break the Enigma Code.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
These were sort of like computers.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
They would do lots and lots of calculations.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The big difference between these machines and what we think of as computers

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
is these machines weren't programmable.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
They were built for one very specific task,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
for doing a calculation that was useful for breaking Enigma encrypted messages.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And it was tremendously useful that they could do that.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
This had a huge impact on WWII.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
But they weren't computers because they couldn't be programmed to do anything else.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We're not going to get into the theory of Turing Machines in this course,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but I hope you'll take one of the later courses that we'll do.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.785
The important point to make now is that, with a very few simple operations,

00:07:35.785 --> 00:07:39.000
you can simulate any other operation you want.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.338
And you've seen arithmetic, you've seen comparisons,

00:07:42.338 --> 00:07:45.000
you've seen how to define and call procedures,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and you've seen how to use "if" to make decisions.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
This is enough to simulate anything else a computer can do.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
So with just that, you could write every possible computer program.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We could end the course here and you could, from just the things that you know now,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
build any computation you want.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We're not going to end the course here though.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.615
And the reason for that is, although you could, in theory,

00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:07.000
build every computation

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.677
using just these very simple things that we have so far,

00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:12.000
that's not going to be the best way to build computations,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that there are more powerful constructs that we can use

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.846
that mean, with a smaller amount of code, or in a more elegant way,

00:08:19.846 --> 00:08:22.000
that we can write the computations we want.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We also have a lot to learn to get practice using these

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
to define more interesting programs.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.323
But in theory, everything that you need to know

00:08:29.323 --> 00:08:31.000
to write any possible computation,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
you already know, from just these constructs that we've seen so far.
