00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.347
It's also important to understand what it is you're trying to accomplish

00:00:02.347 --> 00:00:04.246
by parallelizing the code.

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:07.795
Say you have a serial program that solves a certain problem size P in time T.

00:00:07.795 --> 00:00:11.022
Maybe you're simulating how a certain protein molecule folds,

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:13.525
and that simulation takes an hour to run.

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.770
Weak scaling is what we refer to when we're talking about using parallel computing

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.091
to run a larger problem or perhaps to run more problems.

00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:22.160
So if you wanted to run a bigger protein,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.536
if you wanted to fold a bigger protein in your simulation and still take an hour,

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:29.334
or if you wanted to fold many small proteins in the same hour,

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:32.077
then that would be an example of weak scaling.

00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:36.999
Strong scaling means using parallel computing to run a problem faster, a single problem size.

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.374
So if you wanted to fold that same protein that you were folding in an hour

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:44.842
and you wanted to fold it in a minute, then that would be an example of strong scaling.

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:48.787
More formally, we could say that weak scaling describes how the solution size

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:53.624
varies with a fixed problem size per processor as you add processors.

00:00:53.624 --> 00:00:57.473
We would say that strong scaling describes how the solution size varies

00:00:57.473 --> 00:01:01.639
as you add processors to tackle a fixed total problem size.
