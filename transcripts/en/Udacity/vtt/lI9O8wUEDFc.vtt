00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Unlike the previous problem called Feeling Lucky, where we wanted to modify

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the search engine such that it returned the highest ranking result,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we want to create a new function that orders the results according to the ranking.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now in order to do this, what we need to solve is sorting.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We need to be able to sort the pages according to the ranking.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is a very well-studied problem,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and a canonical example of algorithms.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For the purposes of this course and a kind of reinforced recursion,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we're going to use the quicksort algorithm.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Quicksort is interesting because it's incredibly elegant.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's recursive, and it happens to be one of the fastest ways you can do sorting,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and we're going to do it in just a few lines of code.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Before we get started, I'll go quickly over how quicksort works.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let's say we have this list of 5 elements,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we're going through the quicksort algorithm.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The first thing we need to do is to choose a pivot point.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
A lot of implementations use a random one, but it really doesn't matter

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
if we assume that the data we're given is randomly distributed.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So let's just choose the first element as our pivot point.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That makes coding it simpler, and it's also a little simpler to go through.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What we're going to do now is divide the rest of the elements according to things

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that are smaller than the pivot point and things that are greater than the pivot point.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So let's do that.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So we have our pivot point 2, and now we're going to go through the rest of the elements

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and decide whether or not they're greater than or less than 2.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
A pretty simple operation.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So 1 is less than 2. We're going to add it to this list.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
8 is greater than 2.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
0 is less than 2. Notice how I didn't bother with the ordering of the sublist.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We're going to take care of that by recurring quicksort onto the sublist of each side.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
9 is greater than 2, and we're done.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What we have is a partially-sorted list.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Everything that is less than 2 is on the left side of this,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and everything that's greater than 2 is on the right side.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So what we're going to do is, we're going to redo the same thing to the left side,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the same thing to the right side,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and in the end, once we sorted everything, we combine them all together,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and we have a sorted list.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So let's go through that real quick.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So here 1 is the pivot point. We get 1.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
0 is less than 1.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Here 8 is the pivot point. 9 is greater than 8.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And we're done here. We're also done here.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now we're left with single element lists.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We do quicksort on each of these, and a list of 1 element is sorted,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
so we're done sorting at the bottom.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We now append on the way up.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So the end result of all of these appendings will be our sorted list.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And just to finish our list, let's just say we called it conquer.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Hopefully this gives you an idea of what we're doing.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So let's go to the code, and it might become a little clearer if you're confused.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So our ordered_search takes in 3 parameters:

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the index, the ranking of the pages, and the keyword that we're searching for.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm going to look up the pages that are associated with that keyword,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and then I'm going to quicksort the pages according to the rankings that it was passed

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in to ordered_search.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This is another function that we'll have to define.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So I'm taking in 2 lists--

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the url's and the rankings of those url's which is stored as a dictionary.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So if I didn't get any pages passed in, or it was an empty list or whatnot,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
then I'm just going to not do anything and stop right here.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
This saves some cases that add a little bit of complexity later on if we take care of it now.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So the first thing I'm going to do is find the pivot point,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
which is the ranking of the first page.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
That's, basically, how we did it in the example I went through.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We initialized our 2 lists, the better list and the worse list.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Now we're going to go through each page and put them in the correct list accordingly.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
One thing you might notice is that I didn't go through every page.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I skipped the first page.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
That makes the code a little bit simpler because I've already included the page

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
as the pivot point.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Once we put the pages in the correct list, we're going to recur.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
In order to get the list concatenation to work appropriately,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
you need to put this pages into another list.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
This is the appending that I showed at the end, and this is the recurring that I showed earlier.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This is all quicksort is.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
We got--what is it--14 lines of code,13 lines of code,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and we can even save a little bit here and there if we wanted to,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but we're just going to recur, and we're done.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
To go through it real quickly, if we have 1 page on our list or if there are no pages in our list,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
then it's considered sorted, and we return it right away.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Otherwise, we find our pivot point, which we want to use as the first element,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and for the rest of them, we're going to put them in the appropriate worse or better list,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
if they're better or worse ranked.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
We're then going to recur on each of our sublists, and once that's done,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
we're going to append them all together.
