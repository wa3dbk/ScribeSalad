00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.600
So, here is our plan for the project. I will

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.530
start with step one, which is reading text. Now, here is

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.930
the file I want to check for curse words. For

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.790
now, I have some famous movie quotes in here. By the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.640
way, this file could have contained some other text, like

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.350
the draft of an email or an article you wrote. I

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.210
have named this file movie_quotes.txt. Now, if you want to use

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.330
this exact file in this program. It is available for you

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.970
to download in the instructor notes. But you should

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.900
feel free to use any other text file on your

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.470
computer as well. Okay, let's start writing code. Now,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.830
I created a program called check_profanity.py. You could have called

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.730
it something else as well. Inside it, I created

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.610
a function called read_text, which is empty for now. Now,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.290
I know there is this function in Python called open,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.260
which allows you to work with files on your computer.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.010
This function takes in the address or the location of the file you want to open.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.780
So, on a Windows machine, I will browse

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.980
to my file, which is movie_quotes.txt. Copy its location.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.500
Paste that. And then add the file name

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.360
I want to open, which is movie_quotes.txt. Now,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.830
if you're on a Mac, there is a helpful document in the instructor notes for you.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.450
That document will tell you how to get the location of this file on a Mac.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.700
I will refer to this file as quotes.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.420
Now that I have a way of accessing movie_quotes.txt,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.920
I will use a function called read. So,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.320
I will say, quotes.read. This will allow me

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.290
to read the contents of movie_quotes. So, let

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.790
me save that in a variable called contents_of_file. Let

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.690
me print out those contents. And it's also

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.340
a good convention to close out any file that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.320
we've opened through the program. Okay. Now, I'm

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.600
going to save and run this program and see

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.299
where it gets us.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.400
And boom. Here is that output window with all

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.380
of the movie quotes that we had read from the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.490
text file. Now, I don't know about you. But

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.508
it just blows my mind that we can read from

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:12.720
a text file with only a few lines of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.570
code. Okay, so I am back at our program. Now,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.880
before I continue to execute any more of plan. Let's

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.750
find out a bit more about this function called open.
