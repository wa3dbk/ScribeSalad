00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.340
Sometimes we may want to shape bursty

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.560
traffic patterns allowing for bursts to be sent

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.420
on the network, but still ensuring that the

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.370
flow does not exceed some average rate. For

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.550
this we might use what's called a token bucket. In a token bucket, Tokens arrive

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.280
in a bucket at a rate Rho, and Beta is again the capacity of the bucket.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.010
Now, traffic may arrive an an average rate Lambda

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.520
average, and a peak rate Lambda peak. Traffic can

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.710
be sent by the regulator as long as there

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.610
are tokens in the bucket. To consider the difference

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.390
between a token bucket and a leaky bucket, consider

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.460
sending a packet of size B That's less than

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.200
beta. If, the token bucket is full. Packet is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.420
sent, and b tokens are removed. If the bucket is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.520
empty though, the packet must wait until b tokens drip into the bucket. If the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.570
bucket is partially full. Well, then it depends. If the number of tokens In the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.519
bucket exceed little b then the packet

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.660
is sent immediately, othewise we have to wait

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.850
until there are little b tokens in the bucket before we can send the packet.
