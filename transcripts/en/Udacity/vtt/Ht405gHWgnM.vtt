00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.230
Okay, so let's look at our issue quiz solution.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.900
We have these two instructions to issue. This is the older one to issue. So

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.309
we're going to get a divide, or multiply reservation station.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.270
Mark that this is a divide. F1 and F2. Or maybe this parameters.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.330
Look here, you find it RS4 and RS1 are going to produce that value, so

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.439
we don't get any values from the registered file. And then we're going to update

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.730
for F4 that the result is going to come out of RS5. And now we're done with

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.320
this instruction. This instruction cannot issue. Because it's a multiplication

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.540
instruction, all of the divide multiplier reservation stations ar busy.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.940
So until one of these finishes, this instruction isn't going to issue, and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.330
so now our issue part is going to be stalled until that is resolved
