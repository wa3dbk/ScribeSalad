Before we get to that, I want to make one more important point about types and

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:08.150
that's the difference between static and dynamic types. So, here's some not very

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.630
good python code, but I want to use this to illustrate something about types in

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.136
python. So, the question is, at all the points that I show, what is the type of

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:22.018
X? So, for each box, enter the type of X at that point in the execution. If it's

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:26.768
not known, you should enter unknown. So at each point in this execution, I want

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:31.934
you to answer what the type of X is, so that means, what were the result of type

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:34.903
of X be or if it's not known, enter unknown.
