00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.680
So the answer is, it's an error. And the

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.290
reason why is this first assignment has minutes on

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.840
the right side, but we didn't define minutes previously.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.880
So, if we use a variable that's not defined, there's

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.670
no meaningful value for this. The Python interpreter will

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.900
give us an error. Let's see that in the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.990
Python interpreter. So here, we have just the first

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.350
assignment. When we run this, we get the error that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.550
says the name minutes is not defined. Minutes is not defined

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.490
because we didn't introduce that variable yet. It looks like we're defining

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.610
it. We've gotten in on the left side, but the right

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.530
side needs to execute first. So without knowing the value of minutes,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.490
there is no sensible value this code can produce, so running

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.540
the code produces an error. If we have a statement before this

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.065
that gives minutes a value, then the code will be fine.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.380
We can run this, there's no error. And we can do the

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.590
assignment that we had in the quiz, assigning to seconds

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.590
minutes times 60, and print the value of seconds. This

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.220
works now, but only because we added this definition. We

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.890
need to always introduce a variable before we use it.
