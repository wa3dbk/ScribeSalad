00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.063
So it turns out these are all true.

00:00:02.063 --> 00:00:05.475
All threads from a block can access the same variable in that block's shared memory.

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.682
That's what the shared memory is.

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:12.682
It's a chunk of memory that stores variables that are accessible from all threads in a given block,

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:16.644
and threads from 2 different blocks can access the same variable in global memory.

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:18.829
Well all threads from any blocks at any time

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:24.541
can access a variable or piece of data that's sitting in global memory, so this is also true.

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:28.952
Threads from different blocks have their own copy of local variables in local memory; yes, this is true.

00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:31.801
So every thread has its own copy of whatever local variables--

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:37.317
private variables to that thread are sitting in local memory, so this is true.

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:40.369
And threads from the same block have their own copy of local variables in local memory.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:45.148
Right, so just because they're from the same block doesn't mean that they share local variables.

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:49.787
They share shared memory--per block shared memory, but they don't share local memory.

00:00:49.787 --> 00:00:53.265
So all 4 of these are true.
