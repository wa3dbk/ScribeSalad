00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.120
So now that we've built it ourselves, I'm going to show

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.040
you the easy way to do it, which is to

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.980
use the built in Python type called a dictionary. And

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.770
what a dictionary is is really an implementation of a hash

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.980
table. It's built into Python. So it's much easier to

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.350
use than defining our own hash table. So far, we've

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.650
seen two complex types in Python. We've seen the string

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.480
type and we've seen the list type. Now we're going to introduce

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.870
the dictionary type. So there are many things that are

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.470
common between these three. There are other things that are

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.420
different. So to create a string we could have a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.680
sequence of characters inside quotes. To create a list, we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.650
use the square bracket. And we could have a sequence

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.600
of elements inside the square bracket, and the elements could

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.800
be any type, unlike a string where they had to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.550
be characters. So, our string was a sequence of characters.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.260
Our list was a list of any kind of value. So, a list of elements of any value.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.330
The dictionary type we're going to create using the curly

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.740
bracket. And the entries inside the dictionary are key

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.410
value pairs. So here I've created a dictionary with

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.110
two elements. And each element, the key is a

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.310
string. Here is the string hydrogen and the value

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.920
associated with that element is a number. The keys

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.750
in a dictionary can be any immutable value, so they don't

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.070
need to be strings, they could be numbers. They could be

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.960
other things. The values can be any value. So what a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.230
dictionary is, is a set of key value pairs and the property

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.310
that a dictionary will give us is like the hash table,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.230
that we can look up a key and get a value associated

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.780
with that key. So one important property of all types is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.730
whether they're immutable or mutable. We saw that the string was immutable.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.720
That means once we create a string, we can't

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.870
modify that string. It has the same value it always

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.620
has. A list was mutable, we could change the values

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.040
of elements in the list after we create the list.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.770
We could append to the list, adding new elements

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.170
to it. A dictionary is also mutable. So after we

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.610
create a dictionary, we could add new key value pairs

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.040
to it. We could change the value of values associated

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.640
with keys. We saw with strings, if s is a string, then we can do s index i.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.710
That will give us the ith letter in the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.830
string. With lists, we can do something very similar. If

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.380
p is a list, we can do p index i to get the ith element of the list. With

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.350
dictionaries, it's a little bit different. The syntax is

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.160
the same. We can do d index k. With both

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.120
strings and lists, these were numbers. Here the k is

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.490
whatever the key value is. So this is a key

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.490
in the dictionary. What d index k will give us

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.520
the value associated with that key in the dictionary. We'll

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.020
see some examples soon. We can also use our indexing

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.800
and assignments. We saw, with the list, we could do

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.180
this. That would replace the value of the ith element

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.510
of p with whatever we have here. With the string,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.760
we can't do that. That produces an error.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.410
And the reason we can't do it is because

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.190
strings are immutable. So there's no way to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.520
modify characters in a string. With the dictionary we

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.150
can. And what the meaning of this, is

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.610
very similar to the meaning of update in our

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.140
hash table. So that's equivalent to update the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.160
value. The value associated with k to be v.
