00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.886
I've written down several of the equations that we've seen in this lesson so

00:00:04.898 --> 00:00:09.822
far. And for each of these equations, I would like you to identify what number

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:14.883
is m, the slope, what number is b, the y coordinate of the y intercept, and how

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:19.337
we could write this equation explicitly in the form y equals mx plus b.
