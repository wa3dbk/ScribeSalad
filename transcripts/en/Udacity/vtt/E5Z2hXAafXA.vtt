00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.810
Have you ever noticed how sending
off these update requests

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.820
feels a little like you're sending
messages off to the Firebase void,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.260
unsure whether they're complete or
are received?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.260
&gt;&gt; There.
&gt;&gt; Hello, are you there?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.990
Lila, are you there?

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.960
Okay, well,
at least you're still connected.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.270
Let's talk about completion callbacks.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.580
One aspect of writing data we haven't
discussed is the completion callback.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.260
Completion callbacks are useful
if you want to explicitly

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.450
return the status of
a completed write operation.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.280
For example, if you use a completion
callback when a write is successful or

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.410
fails, an object will be returned
describing the success, or

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.240
in the event of an error,
failure of that write.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.920
For example, if you use a completion
callback when a write is successful or

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.100
fails, an object will be returned
describing the success or

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.930
in the event of an error
failure of that right.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.540
We aren't using completion
callbacks in ShoppingList ++.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.780
However there are a few situations
where using completion callbacks

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.070
would be useful.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.310
A basic use would be to provide detailed
debugging information in the dev and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.710
test phase.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.140
For example, to provide an explicit way
to verify that data is being saved.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.860
Another use would be to use a completion
callback to fire when a value is

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.460
returned that is outside of a threshold.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.220
As a comparison,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.550
have you ever seen the all changes
save to drive message in Google Docs?

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.640
It doesn't hurt to provide users with
a little assurance that their data has

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280
been saved to the cloud.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.130
Similarly, sometimes chat programs will
tell you when the message has been sent

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.860
to the other user.
