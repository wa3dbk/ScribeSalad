00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.748
So when learning like order of operations. That was something that I never

00:00:03.748 --> 00:00:07.087
really thought twice of, especially you know when you're a kid and you're in

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:11.937
the math class and then you're in high school and college. And I mean you're

00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:15.187
told that there's different order of operations but when you're programming

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:18.387
it's a little bit different because then you know you've got you know doubles

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:21.637
and ints and floats and that's something that like off the bat, like I kind of

00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:24.837
struggled with, like sometimes my, like I would run my code and it would work,

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:30.620
other times it didn't work. And I ended up learning that one of the most

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.900
important things is being able to know the answer before it comes out and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.646
understanding how that answer works. And understanding the sequence like the

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:42.785
operations like, what, what different things would work and what wouldn't work.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:46.079
And, one of the things for me, like, you know, even just sitting down with a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.481
piece of paper and understanding, okay, so if I divide by an int, will I get an

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:55.524
int back. Like, if it's a double that I was dividing by. Like, what, what's the

00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:59.725
actual way to do this that's right. And then if that something wasn't right, I

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:02.470
really needed to work hard to understand why at first and now, I mean, it's

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.440
more instinctive that I like, I'll, I'll even write it not thinking twice about

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.440
it. But, when you're learning this, it's something that, like you don't realize

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.936
is actually important to keep things, I guess together and concise. Something

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:15.499
like that.
