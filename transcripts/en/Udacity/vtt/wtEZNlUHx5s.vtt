00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's build the truth table.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For the true location we have three choices,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and because this is a truth table, I write them multiple times.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We happen to know that any of those has exactly 1/3 probability,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we'll be using this 1/3 in a minute.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now say you guess door number 2.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
With this guess Monty will show me an empty door.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
He might show me door 1, 2, or 3.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now I have all the combinations of the true location and the door I'm being shown.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's talk about the probabilities of each of these entries.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If the true location is 1, which has 1/3 chance,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Monty hall will not show me location 1--probability 0.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He won't show me location number 2, because that's the one I guessed.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The only location he'll show to me will be automatically location 3.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's not the true one. It's not the one I guessed.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's the only empty one that remains.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The probability of showing 3 given that the true location is 1 is certain,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but the true location is 1 only with a 1/3 chance.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This specific outcome that the true location is 1 and Monty Hall shows me 3

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
has exactly 1/3 of a chance.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, but analogy, you can now fill out for me the three probabilities

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that correspond to the true location being 3 and Monty showing me 1, 2, or 3

00:01:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
into this these three things over here.
