00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019
And the answer here is that--yes, I think you should play the game

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.070
well, at least, if you're okay with playing games with money.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.730
So with the probability of 5/6, you're making 30% profit,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.510
and with the probability of 1/6, you're making 100% loss.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.050
So, your expected profit for each time you play is going to be 25% of this part over here

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.330
minus about 16.7% for this part over here, which means each time you play,

00:00:30.330 --> 99:59:59.000
you make about 8.3% of profit on average as an expected value of course.
