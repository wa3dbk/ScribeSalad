00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.640
Remember when we talked about
the creative vision for Android?

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.640
One of the pillars was enchant me,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.630
that feeling that the app
was made just for you.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.020
Joanna makes a good point.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.880
Right now,
Sunshine is pretty basic in this regard.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.990
Setting your location isn't exactly
customizing it just for you.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.790
It's just basic functionality.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.922
So what can we do?

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:24.770
Ideally we'd want something visual,
that impacts the whole application.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.370
In fact, our weather icons,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.200
which are used throughout the app,
are perfect for this.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.840
What better way to customize than allow
users to change the very way they

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.200
see the weather.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.230
So let's add the ability
to change icon packs.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.310
We'll keep our APK size small by
downloading the images from the Internet

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.990
using our current included
icons only as a fallback.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.615
Oh, we actually haven't
talked about downloading or

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:50.520
displaying images from
the Internet at all.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.490
Well, let's start there.
