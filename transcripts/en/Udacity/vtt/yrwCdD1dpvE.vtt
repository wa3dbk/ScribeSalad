00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.535
Here's the perspective matrix formed from the 3JS parameters, the numbers in

00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:06.340
the upper left three by three are scale factors, similar to how the

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.814
orthographic projection works, though the z scale's a little different. There's

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:15.414
also a translation factor for z. However, the big differences here are that

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.629
there's a negative one in the last row. And the lower right corner now has a

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.310
zero. I'm not going to derive this projection formula here. Most good 3D

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.002
graphics texts run through this process. Also be aware that for some

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.084
formulations, the near and far values are negative since you're traveling down

00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:33.322
the negative z axis. The one headache of keeping things in a right handed

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:37.626
system is the whole plus is the axis points at the viewer problem. I'm using

00:00:37.626 --> 00:00:40.681
positive near and far values in this matrix, because that's how 3JS specifies

00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:44.868
things and thank heavens for that. In fact these two values must be positive

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:48.609
numbers for the perspective transform. You can see things would get weird if

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.710
the near value for example was somewhere behind the camera. For orthographic

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.128
projections we can use whatever numbers we want for near and far. Even negative

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:59.893
values since we're really just selecting a box in space. For perspective we're

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.042
doing something more elaborate with transforming space so these values must be

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:06.621
positive. The interesting thing is how this perspective matrix works with

00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:11.272
coordinates. Let's take a nice simple case. Field of view 90 degrees, aspect

00:01:11.272 --> 00:01:17.114
ratio one. near 1 and far 11. This gives us this matrix. Let's use this matrix

00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:18.840
on some test points and see what we get.
