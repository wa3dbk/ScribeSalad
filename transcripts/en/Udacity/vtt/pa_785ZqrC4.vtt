Hello and welcome to this lesson on multi-threaded programming.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.030
This lesson begins with a brief review of parallel

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.120
programming in general and moves on to discuss multi-threaded

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.460
programming in particular. It uses the POSIX threads library as

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.280
the conical example, though the same principles apply to

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.020
most all threads libraries. To motivate parallel programming, consider

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.900
the following task. You're given a set of webpages,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.520
some of which link to each other. We'll draw this

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.090
using a standard abstraction of a directed graph, where outgoing

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.960
edges represent links. So webpage A here contains a link

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.020
to webpage B. And our goal is to figure out,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.960
how many links our website, say U, has pointing to it.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.860
This is something that a search engine might do to

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.600
help figure out how popular a website is. Now, there's no

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.160
way to know whether another web page has a link

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.390
to our web page in it without looking at it. So,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.110
in one way or another, we're going to need to read

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380
all of the web pages in our collection. And if we

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.200
try to do this with a single processor, this could

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.855
take a long time. First, I have to read webpage A

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:04.069
then webpage B, etc. Thankfully, this task is highly paralyzable.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.790
That is, there is nothing about my processing of A ie,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.270
counting how many links it has to website U that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.790
affects how I'm going to process website B or website C. So,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.160
I can easily divide up the web pages among, say, three

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.310
CPUs. Let's get these over here to CPU one, these to CPU

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.190
two, and these to CPU 3. Now, we can let each CUP

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.225
count up, in its sub group, how many links it has to

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:31.560
you, and then we can just add these units up to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.580
get our final answer. Returning to our time graph, we see that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.320
with three CPUs, we only need 1 3rd of the time, potentially,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.500
with n CPUs we would only need 1 nth of the time.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.120
It's important to realize that we're doing the same

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.210
amount of work here. Suppose that in our original thread,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.820
we first process the website assigned to CPU one, then

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.700
those assigned to CPU two, and then those assigned to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.350
CPU three. Well, in parallel programming, we've cut this one

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.300
long strand of computation into three shorter strands and arranged

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.870
them in parallel by giving them to three seperate CPUs.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.760
This, of course, is the ideal case for parallel programming.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.470
Now of course, in real life, we don't always

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.160
get as many processors as we want, they aren't

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.790
always available. And given that our application will likely

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.770
be running on the same machine as others, we

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.670
don't know exactly how many processors we will have

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.030
access to. But by expressing our algorithim in this

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.100
way, we can take advantage of the processors that

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.710
we do have and thus make our algorithms run faster.
