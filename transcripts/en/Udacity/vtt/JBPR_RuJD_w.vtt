00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.681
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It turns out, I want to shade region 2. If I plug in the values of 0 for x

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:09.686
and for y, I can see that I get 0 is less than 1. This is a true statement. So,

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:14.550
I know this point satisfies this inequality. So, all of these points also

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.953
satisfy this inequaltity. Try testing some other points to be sure. You'll find

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:21.092
that they all do.
