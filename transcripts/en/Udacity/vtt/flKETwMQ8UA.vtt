00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.975
If you got 3 and 3 4ths that's great. I know I have three entire octagons. And

00:00:04.987 --> 00:00:08.577
then I need to figure out this fraction. This is actually going to be 3 4ths.

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:13.710
Let's see why. I could have split my octagons into eighths. So I know I have

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:18.802
three whole octagons. And then I have 1 8th, 2 8ths, 3 8ths, 4 8ths, 5 8ths, 6

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:24.780
8ths of a hexagon. Remember, I know I can reduce 6 8ths, I know 2 goes into 6

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:29.498
and 8. So I can simplify it. And then I have 3 4ths. To find our improper

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.685
fraction, we just need to count up all the 8ths. If I counted up all the 8ths, I

00:00:34.697 --> 00:00:39.678
would find out that I would have 30 over 8, or 30 8ths. Remember I can reduce

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.311
this fraction. So I get 15 over 4 or 15 4ths. But this doesn't quite make sense.

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:49.026
My picture has 8ths but my answers have 4ths. Well that means I could actually

00:00:49.038 --> 00:00:53.716
have done this a little bit differently. I could have split up my octagons into

00:00:53.728 --> 00:00:58.515
fourths. This would be 1 4th of the octagon. Notice when have fourths I can

00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:03.584
easily see that I have 3 and 3 4ths. I have 3 whole hexagons, and then I have 3

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:08.770
fourths. 1 4th, 2 4ths, 3 4ths of this last hexagon. So 3 and 3 4ths.

00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:13.831
Calculating of improper fraction is pretty easy too I can actually just use my

00:01:13.843 --> 00:01:18.472
mixed number. Because this mixed number is in 4ths, I can figure out the

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:23.324
improper fraction in 4ths. I can multiply 4 times 3, which is 12. That makes

00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:27.892
sense because I have three octagons, and to each of them has four pieces. Then I

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:33.237
have to add three more pieces. So I add 12 plus 3, and I get 15 over 4, 15 4ths.
