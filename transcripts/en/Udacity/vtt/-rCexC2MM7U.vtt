00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
As always, I find the easiest way to answer such a question

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is to draw the finite-state machine.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We come in in state 1, and on a we go to state 2.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And on b we go to state 3,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and then from state 2 on c

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we go to 4, and state 3 on d we go to 5,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and 5 on e goes back to 2, and 5 on f

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
goes to state 6, and 5 on g

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
goes all the way back here to 1, and our only accepting state is 6.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, how can we get to state 6?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If we go up here to the right,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
this is like the place of no return.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We go here, and then there's no way to ever get back down or get to 6,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
so we don't want to go to 4.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We don't want to get to 2.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
How about instead if we go 1, 3, 5, 6 or b, d, f?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But now I need to give another string

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that's different but that's also accepted.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
One way to do that would be to take this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
go to start back loop here, pass go, start again.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 5, 6.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So b, d, g, b, d, f.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Those are 2 strings that are both accepted but that are different.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And if you are feeling exotic, you could actually have gone around these loops more times.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You can add b, d, g, b, d, g, b, d, g at the beginning as often as you'd like

00:01:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and make longer and longer strings.
