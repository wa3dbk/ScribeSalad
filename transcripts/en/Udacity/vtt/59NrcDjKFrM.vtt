00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.420
That's what I wanted to say about components.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.920
In a sense components are easier because, you're going to,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.760
devise them in terms of the functionality, and the functionality is,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.010
dominates what's in the requirements, specification. Connectors are trickier.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.460
Okay. Connectors, are, where the designer has to make some specific choices

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.740
about how to deal with problems. Taylor's definition is a, a connector is a,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.620
a software connector is an architectural element tasked with effecting and

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.750
regulating interactions among components, the piping between those components.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.750
The key way that I like to look at connectors is they provide a protocol for

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.300
interaction among those components. A protocol is a kind of a language saying

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.040
who speaks in what order. What information is passed back and forth, and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.220
what to do if something goes wrong. We're going to later in the course,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.300
devote a whole class to discussing connectors.
