00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.110
I'm sure your memory recall capability is very good

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.670
and you would have come up with the right answers

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.210
for all of these entries. Let me just quickly

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.970
summarize what I'm sure that most of you have gotten

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.560
already. In all cases except this, where the global

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.020
part of the faulting node Ps cache is empty, the

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.900
local part of course is going to go up by

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.530
one, the global part is going to come down by one.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.470
Only when the global part is empty already, there's no

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.970
change. And, in both cases, there's no change to the

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.360
balance between L and G on both the node Q,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.410
which is supplying the page X. And the node R

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.890
that happens to have the LRU page, because it is

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.730
not even part of the action, in terms of the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.000
page fault handling, for these two cases. Now the third

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
case, is where it is on the disk and therefore

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.610
this is immaterial. Right? Because it's not in any

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.550
cluster memory right now. It is on the disk, so

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.120
it's not applicable. Well, the question is what happens

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.971
to the guy that has the globally oldest page. If

00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:06.320
it is on the disk and we have to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.280
bring it into the faulting node, then necessarily we have

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.400
to make space in the cluster memory as a whole

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.050
for this extra page. Because this guy's balance is going to

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.730
shift, and I have to throw this global

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.640
page somewhere. I am picking this guy as the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.380
replacement candidates, because he has the globally oldest page.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.943
But what is going to happen on this node? Well,

00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:31.888
it really depends on whether the LRU page comes from

00:01:31.888 --> 00:01:37.116
the global part or the local part. If it comes from the global

00:01:37.116 --> 00:01:42.240
part, then there is no change on R, because you're basically throwing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.516
this into the global part, and he's throwing

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:48.120
one of those global pages out onto the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.403
disk, right? If on the other hand, the

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:55.147
global page that I sent over here results in

00:01:55.147 --> 00:02:01.179
replacing a local page on node R, because the local page happens to be

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:07.380
the LRU candidate then L goes down by one and G goes up by one. So we had able

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.310
to do more community service in this case and in

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.430
the last case when it is actively shared, again, even

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.930
though we find the missing page in note Q, there's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.380
no change in the balance of L and G because

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.065
it is coming from the active part of L, because

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:25.700
it is shared. It indicates if it is shared it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.220
has to be, from the L part of Q. Since

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.570
it is actively shared, there's no change in the split

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.130
between L and G and of course, this guy has to send one of its global pages

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.630
to some other node, because the memory pressure as a whole is increasing on

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.060
node P. This guy is going to send it to node R that has the LRU page,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.000
and just like in this case, where I have to make room for the cumulative memory

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.960
pressure on the cluster by throwing out a page onto the disk. And similar

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.960
to this case, if the candidate replacement page comes from the local part of

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.250
R, then it is going to result in the local part shrinking by one

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.790
and the global part increasing by one

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.990
to accommodate the page that came from here.
