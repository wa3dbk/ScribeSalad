00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.419
let's try using this concept of function to look at a graph. Remember at the

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:09.180
beginning, I said that linear equations always represent functions, we know this

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.734
because the input always produces exactly one output and we actually have a way

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:17.831
of testing it. We can use a vertical line test to determine if a graph

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:22.624
represents a set of points that is a function. If a vertical line only crosses

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:27.622
the graph once then the graph represents a function. Just like in this case we

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:32.712
know every x value on this graph has exactly one corresponding Y value. We know

00:00:32.712 --> 00:00:37.797
every input on this graph has exactly one corresponding output, or y value. So

00:00:37.797 --> 00:00:42.751
in this case we know the graph and its linear equation represent a function.

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:47.739
Here's a completely different equation that you've never seen before. And this

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.579
is its graph. If we use the vertical line test on this function. We can see that

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.324
it hits the function once here, and then the vertical line crosses twice at two

00:00:57.324 --> 00:01:02.706
different places. This happens for many points along the graph. So we know this

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:08.535
graph and this equation do not represent a function. Let's move over a quill

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:14.256
line a little bit back and look at it when x equals 4. So here's our vertical

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:19.780
line x equals 4 and I can see that I have two points on my graph. I have the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.330
point 4, 2 and 4, negative 2. Notice that the same input x equals 4 produces two

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.045
different outputs, positive 2 or negative 2. Again this is why the graph is not

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:34.099
a function.
