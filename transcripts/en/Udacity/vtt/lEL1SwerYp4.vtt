00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.880
So, we're trying to create a regression estimator for

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.310
the interselection time for candy c.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.330
Right now, the only features that we're working with are the candy we've

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.330
selected, c, and the choice number.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.720
&gt;From visual inspections of the scatter plots,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.920
however, it seems that there may exist a relationship between the popularity of

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.370
a brand of candy, and the presence of other brands sharing the candy bowl,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.360
as measured by interselection time.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.890
This suggests that in order to predict the interselection time for candy c,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.390
we should instead be looking at the presence of other candies in the bowl,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.490
specifically measured by the interselection time of those candies.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.420
So, let's go ahead and adjust our regression estimator.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.370
Where previously, we tried to predict interselection time,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.210
based upon the candy we selected and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.110
the choice number, now we're going to try to predict interselection time,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
based on the interselection times of the other candies that are in the bowl.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.230
So, here I've defined, for

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.520
example, i of c sub 2 is the interselection time for candy c2.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.290
Or, to give a concrete example, we could try to build a predictor of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.520
the interselection time for Starburst, given the number of turns since someone

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.600
has chosen Airheads, Hersheys, Reeses, Kit Kat and Rolos.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.030
After this last adjustment to our question,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.320
we have an even more precisely formulated statistical inference problem.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.160
Just to summarize what we did, we started out with an initial guess as to

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.860
what our features should be for our regression estimator.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.130
After looking at a few scatter plots, we decided to refine our feature set,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.860
to include the presence of other candy in the candy bowl.
