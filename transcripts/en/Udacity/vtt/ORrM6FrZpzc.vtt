00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.890
So the fault tolerance techniques that are used

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.196
often are checkpointing where we can save the

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:10.850
state of the system periodically, then we detect

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.895
errors and restore the state of the system

00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:17.150
once we detect an error. This type of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.430
technique works really well for many transient and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.615
also intermittent faults. So the idea here is

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:25.621
that you will save the state of the system

00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.560
when the system is functioning normally. If a fault occurs

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.920
we will try to detect errors that result from that and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.620
restore the system into a state that was not affected by

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.950
the fault. So if the the fault is transient it will

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.360
not happen again and our system goes back to functioning normally.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.692
If the fault is intermittent, then this might happen a few

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:46.548
times, until we reach the time when the fault is no

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:50.660
longer going to be activated, and then again we will function normally.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.020
So the system continues to function normally, if

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.090
we can quickly recover from each of the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.160
faults, so that it doesn't affect the overall

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.970
availability and reliability of the system. If checkpointing takes

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.418
too long, then this type of recovery has

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:09.026
to be treated as service interruption. But if checkpointing

00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:12.430
and detection and restoring of the state are

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.742
very, very fast it may be that the promised

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:19.684
service is never disrupted. So for example, if the

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:22.724
system is supposed to answer all the web queries

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:27.664
within, let's say one second, if we manage to do all of this in such a way that

00:01:27.664 --> 00:01:30.248
we still respond to all of the things that

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:32.832
we got in one second, then there has been

00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:37.589
no serious interruption. We can use two-way redundancy, where

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:40.813
two modules do the same work. Then we compare their

00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:45.798
results, and we roll back if the results are different. So this is really

00:01:45.798 --> 00:01:48.277
an error detection technique, and it needs

00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:52.112
a recovery technique such as checkpointing. Similarly,

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.990
checkpointing is a recovery technique. It needs

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.750
something like two-way redundancy to actually detect

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.870
errors and while these techniques recover and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.830
detect things separately, we can also have

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.150
something like three-way redundancy which can both detect and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.910
recover some faults. And in this case three modules

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.490
or more will do the same work and then

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.244
vote for what the correct result should be. So

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:23.125
if one module is malfunctioning then the two others

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.939
will still produce the same result and that result

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.217
will be elected by the vote as the overall

00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:31.218
correct result. So the fault in one module becomes

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:33.774
an error in that module but doesn't become

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:36.401
an error at the system level, because at the

00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:39.383
output of these three modules and their voter, we

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:43.070
always have an error free result. This technique is

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.684
expensive. You pretty much need three times the hardware

00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:49.336
plus the voter that you would have without some

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:53.622
fault tolerance techniques. But, in return, it can tolerate

00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:56.292
any fault that can occur in any one of

00:02:56.292 --> 00:03:01.570
the modules. So as long as the fault that you have is affecting only one module,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.790
we can tolerate that fault. Even, for example,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.090
if that one module is purposely designed to be

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.212
malicious. because the correct two are still going to

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:14.620
out vote it and we never really see

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.802
whatever that module is trying to produce in

00:03:17.802 --> 00:03:21.693
our overall results. But what happens if two modules

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:25.370
fail, in that case we no longer can tolerate that.
