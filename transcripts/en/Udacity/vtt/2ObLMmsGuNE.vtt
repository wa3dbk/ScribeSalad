00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
Now, wait a minute, we have an NP complete problem here knapsack and have just shown

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.910
that the running time for solving this problem is of the order of n&lt;i&gt;v given n objects&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.040
and the total value of those objects, if you sum it all up, of v.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.640
Now, I just have to quiz you here of course.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.540
Does this mean that P=NP, although I've told you we don't know, and of course, I don't?

00:00:22.540 --> 99:59:59.000
I just want you to select something here but also to think about why.
