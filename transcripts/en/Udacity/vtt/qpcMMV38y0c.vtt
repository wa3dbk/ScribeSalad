00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the previous quiz, you saw that the solution evolves on a pretty long time scale,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but the step size that we are required to use and the solver is pretty short.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's a phenomenon that can occur with certain types of differential equations.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's called stiffness--it's of course annoying if we are forced to use a very small step size

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
even though the solution develops on much longer time scales.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There is no generally accepted definition of what stiffness precisely means.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But if you think about this situation, you may get an idea about where the term comes from.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Imagine that we have a pendulum, a mass attached below and this is a stiff spring

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the pendulum swings left to right and can oscillate up and down.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then we have two different time scales, the time scale of the swinging motion

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the time scale of the oscillation of the spring and this time scale of the oscillation

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is going to be much smaller than the time scale of the swinging motion.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The observer, however, mostly sees the swinging the motion

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and can't see the oscillation up and down.

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This oscillation, however, will force us to use a very tiny time step in a forward Euler solver.
