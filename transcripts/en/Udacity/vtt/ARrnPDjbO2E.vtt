00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.329
This expression is equal to log base b of 6. Great work if you found this

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:11.360
logarithm. Now again, I think it's easiest to think about having two logarithms

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.927
of base b of 8, and three logarithms of base b of 4. We know that to combine

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:20.372
these three logarithms, or to add them together, we'll need to multiply these

00:00:20.372 --> 00:00:26.540
numbers together. So, we can express the addition of these three logarithms as

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.473
the logarithm of base b of 6 times 8 times 8. Then we'll have the subtraction

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:37.585
of log base b of 4, three times. When we subtract a logarithm, we really divide

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:42.452
this number into this number. Keep in mind this is only true if the logarithms

00:00:42.452 --> 00:00:47.870
have the same base. So when I combine this logarithm with this logarithm, we'll

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.750
really just divide 6 times 8 times 8, by 4, and we'll take the log of base b of

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.733
that expression. These other two logarithms are still on the end. I notice that

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:03.903
I'm going to have to repeat this process. So, if I take this logarithm with

00:01:03.903 --> 00:01:08.181
base b and subtract this logarithm with base b, I'm going to divide by another

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:13.875
4. So, we divide by another 4, and then I still have one more logarithm on the

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:19.378
end. I need to subtract this logarithm of base b of 4 from this logarithm of

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:27.307
base b of this expression. So, I'm simply dividing by another 4. This gives me

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:32.540
a logarithm with one number. Now, I just need to simplify. I know 8 times 8

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.105
equals 64; and 4 times 4 times 4 also equals 64. So, these factors simplify to

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:44.560
1, which leaves me with log base b of 6. Our final answer.
