00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.870
My name is Noam Schwartz.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.300
I'm from Similar Web.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.990
Similar Web is a web company
that helps marketers grow and

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.210
win in the online marketing world.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.940
We basically solve the major problem
of understanding what your competitors

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.060
are doing in digital world,
what's working for them,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.970
what's not working for
them how do they go?

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.710
What people are doing on their
website and the mobile app?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.260
And we working with Fortune
500 companies, with startups.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.048
We really love to help people grow and
win in digital world.

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:35.960
Before joining Similar Web,
I was CEO of a company called Tap Blog.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.430
We were actually competing with Similar
Web and then Similar Web acquired us.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.426
I became head of innovation and
head of US operations for Similar Web,

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:49.730
and since then, I'm working with a lot
of companies, advising them about their

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.540
marketing strategy, about how to win and
how to grow, and having a lot of fun.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.430
When you're starting with social media,
you've gotta have a goal in mind.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.740
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.410
Don't just try to do social media for
the sake of it,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.910
because you want to get more users,
you want to get them to buy something,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.560
you want to retain them,
you want to remind them that your there.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.290
You want to promote an event,
what do you want to do?

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.330
Then after you decide
what you want to do,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.140
you need to be associate it with
the content that your creating.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.080
And I can't stress it enough
how important it is to

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.740
correlate your voice, the content,
and the actual platform.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.240
So let's say that you're a small startup
that is trying to sell clothing.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.960
Does it make sense to you to be present
on LinkedIn, and keep updating there?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.660
The medium sometimes is more
important than the actual message.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.980
One other thing is localization.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.540
Let's say that you have a huge
user base in Brazil or in China or

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.330
in India or in Russia.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.520
There are specific social
networks that exist there and

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.190
they are more popular the Facebook.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.500
You want to have presence there
because you can acquire a lot of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.720
users from there.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.070
Obviously you need to use the language
that they speak in those countries.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.270
But the ROI on using those social
networks can be amazingly high.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.390
Another thing is to treat web
sites like Stack Overflow, or

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.670
GitHub, or even Reddit like social
network because if you have a presence

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.100
there that you keep maintaining and
you keep posting interesting stuff,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.930
you're educating or
entertaining you users.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.330
People will keep exploring who is
this user, who is the president,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.710
who is the company behind
this amazing social present?

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.770
And you'll get even more value for
your money, for your efforts than

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.720
you will get on Twitter, on Facebook or
or wherever you're being present today.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.620
One of the most important things when
you're doing your content marketing

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.730
strategy is first of all, don't look

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.730
at the processes creating content or
creating inventory.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.260
That's a recipe for failure, because you
don't want just to create content for

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.360
the sake of it.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.280
You want to create stuff that
people will actually like.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.230
And the best way to do
something like that

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.630
is to try to imitate
the way a newspaper works.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.590
You want to get interesting content.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.360
Something that will
keep people intrigued.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.690
Something that people
would like to read.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.990
And then produce it.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.880
Don't measure your content
creators based on number of folds.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.900
Measure them based on
the engagement that they can create

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.730
after they published their content.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.690
And not all the will get the same thing,
the same number of likes, clicks,

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.690
whatever you would like
to measure it with.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.860
But eventually,
that's the best steady way

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.540
to measure the success of
the content marketing strategy.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.160
Another example of great content
marketing strategy is Buffer,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.920
for example.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.740
Buffer is a B2C2B company basically that
gives you the ability to schedule your

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.600
Tweets, your Facebook updates, and
schedule your for sure activity.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.390
And their blog, which is one of
the most popular blogs in tech,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.250
has nothing to do with their product.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.320
It has nothing to do with productivity,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.649
with being transparent with your
employees, with being a better person.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.930
And people that don't even
know that they have a company,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.030
that they have a product,
keep following this blog.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.130
And this works amazingly.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.300
One of the things that
we do at Similar Web and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.340
we did in [INAUDIBLE] is following
the activity of companies.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.620
Following what's going
on on the internet.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.900
And the best way to understand
what you want to write about,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.659
what kind of content you want to create.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.420
Just checking it out.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.610
So, one of the things that
we do at Similar Web,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.680
really to create content
that engage people is

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.170
to track the trends that are currently
happening on the internet.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.810
If it's the Sony breach, or
if it's Netflix, what people

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.829
are watching on Netflix today,
new products, new investments.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.400
The Pope's visit to New York, whatever!

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.330
And we write blog posts about it,
we create content about it,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.860
because we see what people care about.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.590
And then if people see the content
we create and they want to share it,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.410
because they want to feel smarter,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.200
because they want to
educate their friends or

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.840
they want to entertain them that's
a huge win with every locals like that.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.959
Let's imagine if we really
start a we need to be scrappy.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.940
We need to not use
a lot of resources and

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.280
get a lot of traction,
a lot of, we need huge ROI's.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.160
So, we invest a lot of time in
creating the content and crafting it.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.230
But that investment in understanding
what people care about,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.800
understanding the specific medium, the
specific timing and the specific context

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.480
that we're going to release this
content is everything for us.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.111
Another example is.

00:05:58.111 --> 00:06:02.760
Before they sold and also after,
they have an amazing blog.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.980
They are the best in
entertaining people.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.860
I think the blog is called
Sriracha Tales or something like that,

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.880
and they are using it for
rants about food,

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.730
and just bragging about
new stuff that they did.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.330
And they entertain their users
in such a way that you feel

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.740
better when you're sharing
some of the content.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.950
This is amazing.
