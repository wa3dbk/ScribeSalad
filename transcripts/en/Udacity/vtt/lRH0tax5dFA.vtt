00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, to introduce this concept,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it's going to help to have another definition that I haven't given you yet.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So here's a graph, we have been talking about things like shortest paths.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So let's look at a path from a to g. So here's a natural path to choose.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's one of the shortest paths from a to g, but it's by no means the only path from a to g.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So here's another path from a to g. a to b to e to d to a to b to e to g. It's a path.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's going from node to node crossing edges but it's not a simple path.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So simple path is not allowed to have any repeated nodes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Any shortest path is going to be a simple path. Right. Why?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Because if we had any repeats along the way from a to g,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
if we visit b and then sometime later we go back to b then there's going to be a path

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that just goes from a to b and then using this path from b to g.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We don't need any of these links in between.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So if the shortest path actually had on it a repeat, it was not simple path,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
then it can't be a shortest path, there must be a shorter path still, so that's a contradiction.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now the longest simple path that you can have, can have it most

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
n nodes on it because there is only n nodes in the graph and we're not allowed to repeat any.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So the longest simple path is at link n. This graph has seven nodes.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So let's ask the question having to do with this graph here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I want you to check each box with number K next to it

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
if there's a simple path of K nodes that goes from a to g.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So for example, it can't be one beacause it has to have at least a and g on it,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and we already solved path a, b, e, g

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that's a simple path that has four nodes on it, so I'll give you four.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
For each possible length, check the box if there is a simple path

00:02:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
with that number of nodes on it from a to g.
