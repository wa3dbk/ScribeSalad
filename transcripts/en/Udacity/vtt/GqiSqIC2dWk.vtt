00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.280
We can start addressing these kind of
issues by practicing adaptive design.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.189
Let's start by talking about
the when of adaptive design.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.220
Or, at what points do you want
to begin adapting your UI?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.410
The basic idea of adaptive design
is that you change your UI,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.850
based on the screen size.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.770
That is, your UI adapts to
the amount of horizontal or

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.810
vertical space that you have.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.690
We do this by introducing
what we call break points.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.500
Break points are the points
at which your UI changes.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.280
For example, you could show another
column of content once your screen width

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.850
is 600 dp or larger.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.870
600 dp is therefore
a break point in your UI.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.160
Now you might be wondering,
how should I choose these break points?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.590
Well, the material spec identifies
some common breakpoints.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.870
While you can start with these,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.590
it's important to ensure your
breakpoints make sense for your content.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.020
It's important to think content first.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.520
You can then think of the breakpoints
as the point in which your UI

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.170
literally breaks for
the content it's trying to present.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.060
So what does it mean
to be content versed?

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.410
In this case, it means starting by
figuring out what the constraints

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.150
are for your content, and then figuring
out the break points from there.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.560
Let's return to some of the layouts
we looked at in lesson one and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.670
see how they might
work on larger devices.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.910
Now, as the screen width
increases with this layout

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.760
The line length the text increases
is making harder to read.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.480
So, you might want to have
a break point somewhere

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.230
where the line length exceeds
45 to 75 character guideline.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.720
In this form layout,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.470
on wider devices there's too much
unused space, here on the right.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.500
Making it feel unbalanced.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.490
You might set a break point round about
say here to re balance the layout.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.990
In this example,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.710
see how these two buttons take
up half the width of the screen.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.870
On wider layouts,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.820
this starts to get quite awkward,
around about say this point.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760
So that might be a break point.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.700
Also notice how maintaining
a constant height and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.150
center crop image starts to
break down on larger sizes.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.810
It ends up showing this kind of small
sliver of the whole image greatly

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.958
blown up.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.330
Lastly, the left-align
content can start to feel

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.180
unbalanced leaving large empty
areas on the right of the screen.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.060
Choosing break points based
on content requirements

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.580
is more future proof than basing
them on a specific set of devices.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.255
You'll know those requirements
will be satisfied no matter

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:27.745
what devices get thrown your way.

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:29.605
Okay.
So

00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:32.675
now that we know that we want to do
something different when a UI gets to

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:34.205
these break point sizes,

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:37.345
in the next section we'll talk
about how you do this with code.
