00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Remember, for perpendicular lines, they're negative reciporicals of one

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:08.020
another. So, we're looking for slopes that are y over x, and negative x over y.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.442
While the slope of these two lines are opposite in sign, they're not

00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:15.225
reciprocals. I know the reciprocal of 2 is 1 half. So these lines can't be

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:19.309
perpendicular. Parallel lines have the same slope. These aren't the same, so

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:23.772
they're not parallel. It must be neither. For the second pair of lines, we know

00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:28.270
that they must be parallel. The slope is 3 in both cases, so b. Here, I do have

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.773
opposite reciprocals of one another. The reciprocal of 2 5ths is 5 halves and

00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:37.299
the slopes are opposite in sign. I don't know what these lines look like, but I

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:42.042
know that they cross at a 90 degree angle because they're perpendicular. This

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:46.261
last one is really tricky. We need to remember that there is a 1 as the

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:51.240
co-efficient in front of the variables. The reciprocal of 1 or 1 over 1 is still

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.018
1. So these are reciprocals of one another and they're opposite in sign so the

00:00:56.018 --> 00:01:00.416
lines are perpendicular. If you got some of these wrong, be careful that you

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:04.605
weren't looking at the b or the y intercept. The y intercept doesn't determine

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:08.856
whether or not lines are perpendicular or parallel. It's only the slope, the m.
