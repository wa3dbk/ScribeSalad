00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.040
The first statement is not correct.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.950
High contrast, rather than low contrast, between text and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.360
background is optimal for viewing data within a table.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.060
The same is true if you plan to display values directly on your own graphic.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.140
The second statement is true.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.350
A sequential palette like this one,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.630
would indicate lower amounts of sales and low levels of saturation, and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.840
higher amounts of sales with more saturation in the green color.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.610
This third statement isn't correct though.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.250
Darker and brighter colors would work better for smaller data points.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.800
If the points were large enough, pastels might be a good option.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.220
But if you don't have too many points in a graphic,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.150
you could also enlarge over the points to aid the viewer's perception.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.320
And finally, this last statement is correct.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.290
There's no value in using cylinders, lighting effects, or

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.930
drop shadows in your data visualizations.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.170
All of these effects simply obscure the data.
