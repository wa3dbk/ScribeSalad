00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:03.100
So now you know how to enable
the email and password provider.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.616
Why don't you change the Android code
to allow your users to be created?

00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:08.347
I've sent you the login screens
I've been working on, and

00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:10.570
they're in a package called login.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.860
We plan to support two types of
login that we're going to use for

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.200
the app, email and password,
and Google sign in.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.640
I'll give you a moment to look at them.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.400
We've got two new activities here.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.070
First is the LoginActivity,
which supports both email password and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.870
Google login.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.050
Second, we've got
the CreateAccountActivity.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.340
This creates new users with
the email password login provider.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.430
Now I haven't added any of the Firebase
authentication capabilities yet, so

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.860
what I'd like you to do is
start by adding the code for

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.290
making a new account in
the CreateAccountActivity.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.110
Afterall, we can't log anybody
in if they're not created.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.989
Here's some code that I copied over
from the Firebase documentation.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.240
It's basically showing you how to use
this createUser method to make a new

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.030
user with the email password provider.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.060
To start you get ahold
of a Firebase reference,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.939
then on that reference
to call createUser,

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:55.000
passing in both the email and
password that you want to associate.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.270
Taking a quick look at
the CreateAccountActivity,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.730
I've made two edit texts for you that
have this information that you need.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.740
The name up here is not
something that createUser takes.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.930
We'll discuss how to
incorporate that data in a bit.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.670
This third parameter is something
known as a ResultHandler.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.580
The ResultHandlers have two methods,
onSuccess and onError.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.250
And these get called depending on
whether the new user you're trying to

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.030
create, let's say onecooldude@gmail.com,
is successfully added as a new user.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.366
If J.P. successfully adds himself,
the code end onSuccess is called.

00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:30.070
If you used ValueResultHandler like I'm
doing here, when onSuccess gets called,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.260
you get an extra little map of
information that contains additional

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.100
login information for a new user.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.101
And just a quick note,

00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:38.849
when you're creating a user you
actually don't log them in.

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:40.950
You have to call a separate
method to do that.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.140
Now, in Shopping Lists Plus Plus'
login flow,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.080
we don't even want to log them
in when they're on this page.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.880
We have a completely separate activity.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.449
The login activity and
that's where we log our users in.

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:53.310
Now that's pretty much all you
need to know about onSuccess.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.510
The other method in your ResultHandler
is of course the onError method.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.548
And this gets called if
anything happens and

00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:00.870
the account is not successfully created.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.450
So why might JP's account
not be successfully added?

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.450
Well there's actually a Full Error
Listing on the Firebase documentation,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.180
which provides some insight
in to what could go wrong.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.040
For example, there could already
be an account using that email.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.140
Or the user could have typed something
that isn't perceived as a valid email.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.565
To be able to know which
of these errors occurred,

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:19.030
you'll need to use
the Firebase error parameter,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.330
which will match one of
these errors given here.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.740
That's the argument shown right here.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.320
And once you've figured out what error
occurred, let's say onecooldude was

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.700
already taken, you might want to give a
helpful message to the user in some way.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.440
Okay, so can you take this more generic
code here and put it in our app so

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.140
that when the user types
in their email and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.020
their password it actually
makes a new user for them?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.410
You'll know you're successful when you
can go to the Firebase dashboard and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.830
see your new account.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.600
So I'm here on the User Login
&amp; Authentication page.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.020
And if I scroll down,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.260
in this area here you'll see
when new accounts get created.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.100
But don't worry about actually
signing in these new users,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.990
that's going to be our next step.
