00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.953
This entire process is called U-Substitution. It's when we can take an equation

00:00:04.953 --> 00:00:10.243
an we make a substitution, to turn it in to our quadratic equation. Here we've

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:14.652
replaced the repeated expression x squared, with the variable u. We created

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:19.453
this so we could perform the substitution. Now we could have made any

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:23.549
assignment for x squared. We didn't have to use the variable u. We could call

00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:29.105
this t substitution and use t or w substitution and use w. It doesn't matter

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.831
what variable you use here you just want to make sure you use the same one

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:36.440
throughout your problem solving. Keep in mind that we performed this

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.196
substitution so we could have a factorable quadratic. We factor this expression

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:45.609
to solve for the values of u. Keep in mind that these values are not our final

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.915
answer. We need to find the original values of the original variable, which was

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:56.034
x. So we take our answers, u equals 9, and u equals 4, and we replace u with

00:00:56.034 --> 00:01:01.642
the original variable that we substituted, x squared. We solved for the

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:06.469
original variable which is x, which gave us our four solutions. Now if you're

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.360
not convinced that each of these is a solution, try checking them in the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.420
original equation. You'll find that all four of them check.
