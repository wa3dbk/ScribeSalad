00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.730
So three of these would reduce latency. The first one is correct.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.990
That would reduce latency because every time you go through a hop,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.860
well there's some time delay there. That you need the time for

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.994
the troops at the hop to see the message that came in and

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.300
then to start their fire to send the same message on to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.070
the next hop. So if you have fewer hops its going to take

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.065
less time for the message to get across. You could reduce the

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:26.130
time it takes to go through each hop. So, if you can make

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
the soldiers at each node work faster, it would take

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.790
less time from the time that they see the message to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.390
the time that they send it on, which is the time

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.490
when the next person will see it. So, the total time

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.690
to get across the network would also be reduced. The

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.500
third choice does not reduce latency. So adding colors would allow

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.010
you to send more messages, but it doesn't reduce the time

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.390
it takes for a message to get across. And we'll see

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.040
next that what adding colors would do would actually increase

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.380
the bandwidth of the network. But it doesn't improve the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.510
latency at all. And finally, because Zeus can do things

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.150
that most people can't, other than possibly physicists in Switzerland.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.400
If you could increase the speed of light, well that

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.590
would make the network faster. Not a very realistic option

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.940
and it wouldn't make it much faster because of the

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.630
transit time even with the regular speed of light, the time

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.120
it takes for the light to travel between

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.660
the points is infinitesimally small compared to the time

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.390
for all the other things like starting fires. But

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.480
all three of these would in theory reduce the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.040
latency. The adding colors would not reduce the latency,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.190
but it would increase the amount of information that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.110
Zeus could send between those points in the same

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.650
amount of time. And that's what we call bandwidth.
