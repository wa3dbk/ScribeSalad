00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
And this was probably a bit challenging but I think it's also quite fun actually

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.250
to play around with these ideas here.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.910
This pre-processing rule here is actually correct and the reason is the following--

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.130
so you have this vertex here and it has just one neighbor, so you have this edge here.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.040
We already know either this vertex has to be in the vertex cover or this one

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.400
because, otherwise, this edge here would not be covered.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.360
Now, taking both is clearly is a waste.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.050
You wouldn't want to do that because once we have put this one here into the vertex cover,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.670
you do not need to put that one into the vertex cover, but if you know that you only need

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.610
to put one of the two vertices into the vertex cover--well, in that case it's always better

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.520
to put this one here into the vertex cover because it will not only cover

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.760
this edge but also some additional edges.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.290
And in this case here, you've basically paid one vertex but you only get to cover one edge,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.320
so it's always better to use this one in that case, which also means that this rule here is not correct.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.770
Now, what about this case over here.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.790
You might be inclined to think that this is the same case so that instead of using this vertex here

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.570
it's always better to put these two into the vertex cover, but unfortunately that is not the case

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.470
and I will give you a very simple example of this.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.400
If you have a graph that looks like this for example--you look at it this way

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.280
that this part here is the same as this part here, then you can see that if you put these two vertices

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.990
into a vertex cover, then you need an additional two vertices and it can be either one of those

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.200
or either one of those but you need two more to cover the whole graph.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.940
This would give you a solution of size 4, and actually, this graph has a vertex cover of size 3

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.040
if you use this one here and this one and this one and you have a size 3 solution.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.500
This is not a correct rule because it can lead us to find a suboptimal solution.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.040
So you have to be careful with pre-processing rules as useful as they are,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.990
but actually just having this one rule over here is already pretty cool because what does it tell us--

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.730
Well, once we have a vertex with one neighbor such as this one here, we'll put that one

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.730
into the vertex cover and we also know that we do not need to put this one here into the vertex cover,

00:02:00.730 --> 99:59:59.000
and this will now help us to improve our search tree.
