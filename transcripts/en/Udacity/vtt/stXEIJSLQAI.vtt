00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.480
As we already said before, direct
mapped, and fully associated caches

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.760
can be considered to be just special
cases or set of associated caches.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.540
So for example,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.370
a direct mapped cache, is actually
a 1-way set associative cache.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.850
And a fully associative =
N-way SA where N = # of lines.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.520
For all this caches,
the address that the processor supplies

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.400
is broken into the offset,
index and tag components.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.840
The number of offsets bits is
the number of bits that we need to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.820
tell us where in the block size we are.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.130
So it's log2 (block size).

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.250
The number of index bits
is log2(# of sets) we have.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.080
In a direct mapped cache,
that is the number of blocks we have.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.040
In a fully associative cache,
that's 1, so log2 of that is 0,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.000
and we have no index bits.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.990
And the tag bits are the remaining bits.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.090
When you're trying to figure out
which bits are the index bits,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.250
we actually need to know which
bits are the offset bits, too.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.300
Because knowing that we have,
for example,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.720
three index bits doesn't really tell us
whether they're here, or here, or here.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.270
That depends on the offset bits.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.760
So make sure that when you're
determining these bits,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.810
you do it in that order.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.100
First figure out how many
offset bits then the next so

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.770
many bits are indexed bits and
then the rest is the tag.
