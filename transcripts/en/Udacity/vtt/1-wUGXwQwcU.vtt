00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.530
Now let's look into the details of the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.928
There are two publicly known numbers,
a prime number Q and

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:12.445
an integer alpha that is
a primitive root of Q.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:13.872
Now suppose users A and

00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:19.530
B wish to exchange a key using the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.150
User A selects a random integer
XA that's less than q, and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.460
computes you that's raised alpha
to the power of XA and then mod q.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.200
Likewise, User B independently selects
a random integer XB that's less than q,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.790
and then computes YB, that is,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.890
alpha raised to the power of XB and
then mod q.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.840
Each side keeps the X value private and

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.100
then sends the Y value
to the other side.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.930
Because the Y value is transmitted,
in effect it is public.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.469
User A upon receiving YB
would compute a key as YB

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.427
raised to the power of XA mod q.

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:07.314
This is actually the same
as alpha raised to power of

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:09.920
XB times XA then mod q.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.954
Likewise, User B upon
receiving you computes

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:19.986
a key that is you raised
to the power of XB mod q,

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:27.151
which is the same as alpha raised
to the power of XA times XB mod q.

00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:32.580
That is, both sides have,
in effect, computed the same key.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.320
In other words, now User A and
User B have a shared secure key.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.040
Furthermore, XA and XB are private, and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.456
an adversary such as User C only
knows Q and alpha, which are public,

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:52.040
and you and YB, which is transmitted,
and they are also public.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.290
If the attacker wants to
compute the shared key,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.250
he must first compute the X value.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.120
For example,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.840
the attacker must compute the discrete
log of YB in order to get XB.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.949
If the attacker can compute
a discrete log and obtain XB,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:14.610
he can then compute the shared
secret key by using the you value.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.230
The security of the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange algorithm lies in the fact that

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.010
while it's relatively easy to calculate
the exponents modulo a prime,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.110
it is very difficult to
compute a discrete logarithm.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.290
For large primes such as Q
at at least 300 digit long,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.360
this task is considered infeasible.
