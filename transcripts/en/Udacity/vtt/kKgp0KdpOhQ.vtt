00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.180
Here's the math on why RSA works.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.770
We know that the public key is e and
n and the private key is d,n.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.020
We also know that n equals to p times q,
and p and q are prime numbers.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.400
Therefore, quotient n is p
minus 1 times q minus 1.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.700
The public key e and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.660
the public key d are multiplicative
inverse of each other, mod potion n.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.160
That's why we say the public key and
the private key are paired together.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.390
And therefore when we compute X raised
the power of e times d it's the same as

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.020
X raised to the power of e times d
mod potion n which happens to be 1.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.940
That is, let me compute X raised
to the power of e times d

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.290
is the same as X mod n.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.890
So that is a quick recap of
the properties of the RSA public and

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.980
private keys.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.920
Now, to encrypt a message m,
we raise m to the power of e mod n.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.200
To decrypt, we take the ciphertext,
raise it to the power of d mod n.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.500
This is the same as raising m
to the power of e times d mod n,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.428
which is the same as m mod n
according to this property.

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:18.640
Since we require that the plain
text input is smaller than the key,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.770
that means m mod n equal to m and
that's the original plaintext.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.370
So this shows that
decryption indeed works.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.550
As an exercise,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.880
you can similarly verify that digital
signature under RSA also works.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.260
Here's an example of RSA,
the keys are generated as follows.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.754
We select two prime numbers.

00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:46.610
p equal to 17, q equal to 11 so
n is p times q,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.810
which is 187 and totient n

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.780
is p minus 1 times q minus 1
because p and q are prime numbers.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.620
So in this case,
totient 187 is 16 times 10 which is 160.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.930
For public key we select a number
that's relatively prime to totient n.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.300
In this case, we select 7,
because 7 is relatively prime to 160.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.050
The private key d, is the multiplicative
inverse of e Mod potion n.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.500
So the multiplicative
inverse of 7 mod 160 is 23,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.460
therefore the private key is 23.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.470
To summarize the key generation process,
we have

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.000
the public key 7, 187,
public key 23, 187.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.410
Suppose we use a public key to
encrypt the plaintext message 88.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.920
We raised 88 to a power of 7 mod 187,
the result is 11.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.640
To decrypt we raise 11 to
power of 23 and then mod 187.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.375
The result is 88,
the same as the plaintext.
