00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.090
The rise of mobile platforms
revolutionized gaming

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.950
in more ways than one.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.374
Not only did it put a powerful
game device in everyone's pocket,

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:13.048
it also introduced two major
technological improvements to the way we

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:14.992
interact with computers and games.

00:00:14.992 --> 00:00:18.210
Touch and orientation detection.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.230
Touch, including multi touch and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.320
gestures, can make game controls
feel natural and totally seamless.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.220
They allow you to provide a direct
physical connection to your game.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.290
If it's done right, it can make all
the difference to the feel in gameplay.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.100
Games like Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.770
showed everyone what can be accomplished
with this funky new input method.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.800
And there's really no question that
touch made those games successful.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.100
It's hard to imagine
either game without it.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.130
Accelerometers allow for a second new
form of input, orientation detection.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.330
Knowing how the phone or tablet is
positioned or moving through space,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.780
opens up all kinds of opportunities
to make your game more immersive.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.340
Whether it's a driving
game you have to steer, or

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.220
an augmented reality app, the
accelerometer gives you control options

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.120
that have really never
been available on PC.
