00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.870
So let's see if we can figure out what
the directory will be doing in a MOESI

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.109
protocol if we have 4 cores
numbered 0 through 3 and

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.840
if a directory slice for
location A is in slice 0.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.379
If what happens is this, core 0 reads A,

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:21.158
core 0 writes A, core 1 reads A.

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:28.970
Core 2 reads A, core 3 reads A,
and then core 0 writes A again.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.050
The question for you is in this
sequence of accesses, assuming

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.090
that A's not in any of the caches
at the beginning of this, how many

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.300
requests are sent by these caches to the
directory only counting the requests?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.000
Then the directory forwards these
requests through how many messages?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.160
Note that it need not be
the same number here.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.350
As a result of sending these, the
directory gets how many responses and

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.820
replies?

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.720
And finally, how many responses
does the directory send itself?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.510
Again, the protocol is MOESI for
this course, and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.820
we have a directory
protocol with 4 cores.
