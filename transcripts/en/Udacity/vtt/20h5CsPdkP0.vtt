00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.422
The numbers one, negative one, i and negative i all, when taken to the fourth

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:08.813
power, equal one. In case you're curious about how exactly this works, I've

00:00:08.813 --> 00:00:13.076
written them all out for you here. I think probably taking negative i to the

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:17.496
fourth power is the least intuitive of these, but we know that when we multiply

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:22.182
two negatives together, the negative signs cancel one another our basically. So

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:26.446
negative i times negative i is just i squared which is negative 1. So negative i

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:30.636
to the fourth is really just negative 1 squared or 1. This is another way where

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:34.860
imaginary and real numbers interact in a super fascinating way in my opinion at

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.080
least. Who would have thought that there are all these different numbers that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.683
are multiplied by themselves 4 times equal to 1?
