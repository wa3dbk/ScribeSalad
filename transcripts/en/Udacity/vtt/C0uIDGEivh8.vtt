&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There's an x in both terms, so you can pull that out, leaving us with x times

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:08.809
the quantity a plus b. Of course, you could also write this differently, as a

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.985
plus b times x. In fact, I prefer this way, so that's what I'm going to use.

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:16.303
That way our x is behind our coefficients. That's pretty.
