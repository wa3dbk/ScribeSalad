00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.980
Let's look at the solution to our Predictor Impact Quiz where we considered

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.230
the Intel Pentium 4 Prescott processor, that spends 30 cycles until it finally

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.780
resolves branches. Uses branch prediction and multiple instructions per cycle,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.755
so that in a program where 20% of instructions are branches, and

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:24.400
where 1% of branches are mispredicted, it gets a CPI of 0.5 overall.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.400
In this CPI, we are getting some ideal CPI plus,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.770
for branches that we mispredict 1% of the time,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.790
we pay a 30 cycle penalty, because we resolve branches really in the 31st cycle.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.960
And that means that the ideal CPI is equal to

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.450
the actual CPI we are getting, minus the CPI penalty from branches.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.060
And if we multiply this out, we get 0.06. So x here,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.527
the ideal CPI with a perfect branch predictor, would be 0.44.

00:01:04.527 --> 00:01:13.120
Now when 2% of branches are mispredicted, our CPI will be equal to x plus,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.040
for branches we mispredict 2% of the time. And

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.640
we pay a 30-cycle penalty, so we get 0.44 plus this,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.460
which multiplies out to 0.12, for an overall CPI now of 0.56.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.780
So the key to solving this again was that we were given the actual CPI.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.010
We needed to compute what the ideal CPI is after we remove the branch penalty.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.710
And then, we compute the new branch penalty and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.880
add it to this ideal CPI to get this answer.
