00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.730
Recall the five rules of message passing
and consider the following scenario.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.450
Suppose I have a linear
network of eight nodes.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.660
So suppose that node zero wants
to send a message to node two,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.640
at exactly the same time that node six
wants to send a message to node three.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.582
How much time will it take for these
two simultaneous messages to transpire?

00:00:21.582 --> 00:00:24.639
Here's the path from
node zero to node two and

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:28.470
here's the path from
node six to node three.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.040
Notice that these messages occupy
independent paths in the network,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.600
therefore, they can
happen simultaneously.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.510
So if the messages are both of size n
then the time is just alpha plus beta

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.830
times n.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.720
Now I want you to try.
