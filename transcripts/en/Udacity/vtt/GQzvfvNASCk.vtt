00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
Okay so we have seen that we have to worry about the read after write

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.530
dependencies because we actually have to feed the value that the instruction

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.650
needs, from a previous instruction. We also have to worry about write after

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.700
write dependencies possibly because we don't want, we want the last instruction

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.900
in the program order to be the last one to actually. Write the result. And

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.561
also anti dependencies we need to worry about them too because, we don't want to

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:26.760
overwrite results before the instructions that need them have had a chance to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.330
use them. So, now we're going to talk about removing false dependencies.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.580
What are false dependencies? Well, we have read after write.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.940
We have write after read. And we can also have a write after a write. These,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.150
are called true dependencies. Because, you actually have to obey them,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.850
that's how the program computes. Some instructions produce values that are then

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.325
used by other instructions and so on. So the instructions that use values really

00:00:56.325 --> 00:01:03.480
depend on instructions that previously wrote the results. In contrast, these.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.540
Are called, false or name, dependencies. Why?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.900
Well, because there is nothing fundamental about them.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.280
They are dependencies just because you're using the same register for

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.155
two different results. So, for example, in a write after write dependency we

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:23.490
have seen that two different instructions would write to the same register and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.610
that creates the write after write dependence. If the second of those two

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.810
instructions, were using another register to write this value,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.120
then there would not, be no dependents. We will see an example of this a little

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.680
bit later. But the idea is that while true dependencies,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.220
you actually. Have to delay instructions in order to satisfy them,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.820
with the name dependencies you could actually execute instructions earlier.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.330
If only you could take care of, you know kind of multiple values for

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.560
the same register as we will see just in case, just in a couple of seconds.
