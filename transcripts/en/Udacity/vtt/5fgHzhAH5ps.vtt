00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.589
The URI or

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.070
uniform resource identifier is the path
to find resources provided by your API.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.160
This means that our URI should
always refer to resources and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.210
not to actions being
performed on those resources.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.776
And it is recommended to use
the plural form for each resource name.

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:21.527
HTTP provides us with eight verbs,
or methods,

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:24.650
we can use to indicate
the desired method of action.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.600
We want a server to take
on an API endpoint.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.680
There's no rule forcing you
to use all of these verbs.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.430
But it's a good practice
to use them responsibly.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.150
Head and get requests can be
called by search engines and

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.240
web crawlers exploring the Internet.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.992
Make sure these requests only
provide information, but

00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:43.868
never modify your database,
or the state of your backend.

00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:47.813
HTTP also has status codes to indicate
the different types of responses

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:49.860
a server can send back to the client.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.410
A good API should take advantage of
these status codes for successful and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.170
erroneous HTTP responses.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.820
Error messages you send to your
users should be concise, clear, and

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.329
informative.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.650
Proper URI paths, HTTP verbs, and error
messages are all important components

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.980
for making your APIs understandable,
and easily implementable.
