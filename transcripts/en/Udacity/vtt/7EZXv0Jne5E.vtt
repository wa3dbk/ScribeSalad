00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.575
These are the correct answers. Great algebra solving if you got them. We start

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:08.830
by taking the square root of both sides of our equation. So, 3r minus 2 will

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.721
equal positive or negative root of 27. I'm going to go ahead and simplify the

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:18.488
square root of 27 to be 3 root 3. Next we add 2 to both sides of our equation

00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:23.526
to get 3r is equal to 2 plus or minus 3 root 3. We divide both sides by the

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:28.100
coefficient of 3 to get our final result. And if you prefer, you can write your

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.218
answer as two fractions. 2 3rds plus or minus 3 root 3 divided by 3.
