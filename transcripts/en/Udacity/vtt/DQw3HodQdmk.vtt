00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.129
So as noted previously, there are two types of primary sensors we would be

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:06.741
interested in looking at, film versus digital.

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:11.451
There's a long-term debate that has been going on between film versus digital,

00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:13.848
use of either film or digital in cameras.

00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:18.528
I'm not going to get into that religious debate, to me that debate has,

00:00:18.528 --> 00:00:24.370
similar feeling, as a debate between digital music or through vinyl recordings.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.880
We will look at both of them.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.450
Film usually comes in canisters like this.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.840
You've seen different formats of this.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.240
For digital, basically what we need is some sort of a storage media.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.860
Here I'm just showing you some generic forms of,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.680
flash disk that are not commonly used in, cameras.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.860
I'm going to make a claim that film and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.130
digital cameras are practically the same.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.600
For example, if I showed you this camera, this large camera here, again,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.230
a digit, this is an SLR camera.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990
Or, I showed you this camera.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.520
Both of them look exactly the same.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.298
Both of them have you know, the shutter.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.699
They have lenses.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:10.924
And this is a single lens reflex camera, which basically means if

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:16.814
I was to open this up, and put this right here, you can see it has a mirror,

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:22.100
and if the mirror pops up, there should be a sensor behind it.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.180
And, of course, the shutter controls how the shutter would open.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.420
And the mirror is moved up and,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.320
of course, the optics of the lens here are also the same.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.900
So in essence, hopefully you'll agree with me,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.340
that both cameras have pretty much the same form factor.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.838
Of course, you may be arguing with me that, oh, things are really different now.

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:45.288
For example let's say,

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:48.609
you know, I bring in a cell phone which has a camera here.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.208
This is a complete change in thinking about how photography's done, or

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:55.516
let's look at, for example, an instamatic kind of camera here.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:56.917
This, of course, is a digital one.

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:59.628
But if you look at all instamatic cameras,

00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:04.821
they pretty much have the same form factor lens sensor, which could be film,

00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:09.294
and in this case, of course, if you look at it, the film is not there.

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:12.650
And, of course, we have is a small disc.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.350
So this whole thing basically suggests that cameras are still alike, in their,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.070
you know, kind of the whole form factor that we've seen them for a long time.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.300
They've just gotten smaller and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.550
also have a lot more different types of functionalities.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.370
I will admit that with the innovations there have been

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.700
significant improvements in actuators and lenses.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.760
Lens quality, of course, in the old days, was very good and is still very good.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.450
But the actuators, the motors that are come in,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.100
are actually much better than they ever used to be.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.440
Furthermore, the sensors and stuff that we use in cameras now may not

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.320
have the same kinds of fidelity as film.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.440
But of course, instant gratification.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.190
We get pictures the moment we take 'em, and we see them right away.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.500
The bottom line with all cameras, in general, is there is no difference in how

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.750
light is transported through the lens, but it's how it's trapped and preserved.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.510
So the whole process of how it's sensed, trapped, and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.400
preserved, either in film or in digital form, is what's changed.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.920
For film, basically, there's a chemical process.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.150
For digital, basically, it's the electronic process of how light energy is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.360
converted to electronic signals, which are then saved as digital signals and

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.090
then are converted into pixels.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.900
In case of film, it's a chemical process that converts light energy and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.010
preserves it in a format that basically can be saved on film.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.220
I, I had earlier already shown you this camera that I have popped open.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.420
And it had a film in it, like right here.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.560
Basically I navel, I know it's an exposed film.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.740
But basically, that's what we have in old traditional cameras,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.860
a thin frame here.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.080
I'm not going to take it out right now.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.850
So here you basically just see the film.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.670
I've, of course, exposed it.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.350
But that's basically in a canister and,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.140
of course, basically it goes through as soon as I take a shot.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.320
I forward the film, and I expose the next one.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.940
This is, of course, the film taken out of the camera.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.380
This is exposed but not developed film.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.030
After a film is exposed in the camera, you take it to a darkroom, and

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.340
then other chemical processes are added to develop to be able to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.190
get the images out in the negative format that we have seen before.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.634
I'm sure all of you have played around with negatives and

00:04:36.634 --> 00:04:37.670
have seen them in person.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.590
So the bottom line is,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.500
we have a canister, we have digital format in form of a disk, right now.
