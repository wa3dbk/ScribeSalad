Reviews, like design, testing, and coding, are software development activities.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.810
As such, they can be measured to see how effective they are.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.430
The key statistics to compute are the following. First off, the review rate

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.290
in lines of artifact reviewed per staff hour spent reviewing. Second is

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.100
defect rate in the number of defects detected per staff hour spent reviewing.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.020
Then from those numbers the defect density is the defects per line of artifact.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.240
This can be used to indicate whether the process of producing that

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.340
artifact is leaving too many defects in it. And then, process yield

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.060
is computed by comparing the review detected defects to total defects,

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.600
or how do you know what the total defects are? One way of getting a total

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.114
defect includes those defects detected by other means, such as testing and

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:57.000
those that are eventually reported by users of the delivered product.
