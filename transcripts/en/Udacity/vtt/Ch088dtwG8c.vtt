To compute the average, you first need to compute the sum using the algorithm

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:11.146
from lesson seven, we traverse all elements in the array. Ask each of it for

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:16.422
its area and sum them all up. Then we return the sum over the count, which is

00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:22.120
the sum over the length of the array. And as you can see here, I was a little

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.945
nervous. What if someone gives me an array of length zero, then I don't want to

00:00:26.945 --> 00:00:31.922
divide by zero. So, I'm checking for that, and in the admittedly unlikely case

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:39.346
that I do get an empty array, I return zero. When you run the program, It gives

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:45.612
you an average area of about 75,000 square kilometers. That's actually not very

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:51.158
large, it's a bit larger than West Virginia. Next, let's see how we can compute

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:53.710
the average of another set of objects.
