00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We've just finished learning about sets of strings,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
regular languages, regular expressions, and finite state machines,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a beautiful formalism and a lovely way of implementing it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in actual Python.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This idea, this tool of regular expressions

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
specifying sets of strings is a really powerful

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and really expressive way of writing quite a few programs.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're going to see this come up later on in everything from

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
mail to web servers to web browsers

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to writing our interpreter for JavaScript and HTML.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You've learned quite a bit in Unit 1, and I'm really hoping

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that you'll stick with me and learn even more in Unit 2.
