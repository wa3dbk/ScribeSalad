00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.798
Since this kind of construct is really quite common. Python provides a better

00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:07.255
way to do it, and that's called with. A with statement looks like this. We've

00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:11.452
got a ContextGuard which is some expression that evaluates an object. And we've

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:15.909
got some variable name. And I'm not going to go into all the details of how with

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.632
works. There is more details on this following the links below. But, as a useful

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:24.752
idiom for working with files, what we're going to do is use as our ContextGuard,

00:00:24.752 --> 00:00:29.485
we're going to open the file, this is kind of like doing an assignment. The

00:00:29.485 --> 00:00:34.135
value that the name fout refers to will be the result of this object, but the

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:38.860
big difference is the with statement guarantees that this magic method for

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.060
exiting will be called on this object, on the object returned by the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.116
ContextGuard. And it guarantees that as long as this executes and we enter the

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:54.247
Block that exit will always be called. For a file, what exit does is cleans up

00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:58.088
the file including calling file close. That means we don't need to explicitly

00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:02.283
close the file at all. All we need to do is use with. So our code will look like

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:06.936
this. We'll use with open, opening the file, and assigning it to the variable

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:10.109
fout. We're going to do a bunch of stuff with it. We'll write to the file and

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.335
then after the with statement we can continue. And we know that this file will

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:18.613
always be closed. We don't need to explicitly call close.
