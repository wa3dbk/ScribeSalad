00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.816
So reflecting on the long division problem we just did in the last quiz, how

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:07.470
can the results of this problem give us a new way to rewrite the polynomial we

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.492
started out with? 4x squared minus 4x plus 1. Can you write this instead as the

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:17.712
product of two polynomials? Now just so you know I would like you not to write

00:00:17.712 --> 00:00:22.830
1 and then this expression as the two polynomials. Pick two new polynomials.
