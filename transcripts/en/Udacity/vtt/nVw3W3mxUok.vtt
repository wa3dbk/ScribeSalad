Can you identify the two
methods of view presentation

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.660
in the apps you use from day to day?

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.060
After you've done some investigating,
answer the quiz question.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.490
When are pages presented from left
to right, as in navigation, and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.280
when are they presented from the bottom,
as in modal presentation?

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.600
And for more insight from people who
spend a lot of time thinking about user

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.460
interface design, check out Apple's
human interface guidelines on navigation

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.910
and modal presentation.
