00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.969
So let's have another quiz using the example that we just

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.660
used. This one is about achieving 100% branch and condition coverage. So

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.850
let me bring back the two tests cases that we just saw,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.420
and as we saw a few minutes ago, these tests cases do

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.540
not achieve 100% branch and condition coverage despite the fact that they

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.430
achieve 100% condition coverage. So both conditions are both true and false,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.820
for these test cases. So what I want you to do is

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.630
to add a test case, to achieve 100% branch and condition coverages.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.740
So specify the test case by writing here the value for x, and the value for y.
