00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's really quickly look at mine.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It doesn't necessarily need to be the case that yours looks very much like mine at all

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
as long as it accomplishes an effect that's somewhat similar.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So what we're going to do here is set N, the size of the queue, to 4,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
create a new queue of that size, and immediately call checkRep

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because basically, every time we do a queue operation,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we'd like to do the checkRep.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So if anything goes wrong with the queue, we detect it as early as possible.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We also initialize an l to be empty.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So this l and the q are always going to contain the same number of elements

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in the same order, so l and q are always going to have the same contents.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So now we're going to do 10,000 random tests,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and each test is going to be randomly either an enqueue or a dequeue.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And if it's an enqueue, we're going to enqueue a random integer.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
After enqueueing, we call checkRep,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and if the enqueue succeeded, we're going to append the item that we enqueued

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to our list which is mirroring the queue's contents

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and also increment a variable saying how many times this operation succeeded.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
On the other hand, if the enqueue doesn't succeed,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I want to assert that the length of our list is equal to N--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that is to say, the list has the same number of elements as a full queue--

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
assert that the queue is full, call checkRep again, and also increment a counter

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
indicating we performed an add operation on a full queue.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We're not going to talk about why these counters matter just quite yet,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but we're going to look at this a little bit later. The dequeue structure is exactly analogous.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We're going to issue a dequeue operation with 50% probability,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
checkRep, and then we're going to do sort of the analogous empty checking operations

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that we did and empty checking operations if the dequeue operation failed.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And if the dequeue succeeded, we're going to pop off an element off our list

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and also ensure that it's exactly the value that we expect.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So once that loop terminates, we're going to go into a loop

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
whose purpose is to empty out the elements of the queue

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and finally, after we've drained the queue of all elements,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we're going to assert that our list which mirrors the queue is also empty.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So that's my little random tester for the queue.
