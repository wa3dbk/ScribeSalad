00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through it together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Starting from sentence, I can get to subject verb.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
One possible subject is students.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
One possible verb is think.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We saw this one before. This is definitely in the language of the grammar.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
However, students teachers is not.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's 2 subjects in a row, and there's just no way to get there

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
starting from sentence.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We can turn sentence.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can rewrite it into subject followed by verb,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so we can match students at the beginning, but teachers is not a verb.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There's just no way to make this happen.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Students write, this is one of our subjects, this is one of our verbs.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That looks good. Teachers think.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Teachers think, that's a subject followed by a verb.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That looks good. Teachers write.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That also looks good. Think write.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
These are 2 verbs, and our rules up here say a sentence

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
has to be a subject followed by a verb.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This just doesn't match the pattern.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And in fact, in this particular grammar, these 4 are all of the strings in the grammar.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There are only 4 possibilities.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This grammar is perhaps not super exciting,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but we're going to get to something, many things,

00:01:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
much more exciting than this in just a bit.
