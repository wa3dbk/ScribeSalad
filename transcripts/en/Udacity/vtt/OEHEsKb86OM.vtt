00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.300
This course has five lessons that
are depicted in this course map.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.360
But, before we dive into them,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.620
it's important to have a firm
understanding of network basics.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.860
So, we're going to start with
what I'm calling lesson zero.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.820
In this lesson, we're going to
talk about how apps send and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.730
receive data over the network.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.800
Then, we'll show you how to implement
this concept in iOS, using Swift.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.960
We'll do this by building a very
simple app that downloads an image

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.230
over the network and
displays it to users.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.190
Also as we go through the lesson,
we'll be keeping track of terms and

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.570
concepts in a concept list to
help us keep everything straight.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.110
You'll see it in just a minute.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.640
Let's get started by
inspecting some popular apps.
