00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.680
Here are the solutions for 10, 1, and 9x squared minus 36x plus 37. Great

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.219
solving, if you got all three of these correct. Now, if you only got one or two

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.354
of these right, that's okay, too. These are not the easiest problems, and I'm

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:19.789
sure you'll get it with more practice. To find f of g of 1, we first need to

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.942
find the g of 1. So, when 1 is the input for g, we should get an output of

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:33.150
negative 2. We get that simply by letting x equal positive 1. So, now, that we

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.445
know g of 1 equals negative 2, we just need to find f of negative 2. We use

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:45.346
negative 2 as the input for f. If we let x equal negative 2 for this function,

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:50.757
here and here, then we can see that we'll get a total sum of 10. Negative 2

00:00:50.757 --> 00:00:56.542
squared is positive 4. Negative 2 times negative 2 is positive 4, which makes

00:00:56.542 --> 00:01:03.222
8, plus another 2 equals 10. This is how we solve the first problem. And we can

00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:08.740
use the same approach to tackle this problem, f of g of 2. Letting the x value

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.692
equal 2 here, we get a g of 2 equal to 1. So we know that the output of g is 1

00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:21.599
when x equals 2, so I can replace this g of 2 with the value 1. Now we just

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:26.956
need to find f of 1. I'm letting the output of g when x equals 2, now be the

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:33.018
input for f. Negative 2 and positive 2 sum to zero. So then I just have 1

00:01:33.018 --> 00:01:38.880
squared, which equals positive 1. Now, we've done two calculations for f of g.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360
But it would be so much nicer and easier if we just had one function to work

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.648
with. An f of g of x function. So to find this function, we simply take g of x,

00:01:48.648 --> 00:01:54.944
and we plug it in anywhere we see an x and f. So notice that here and here,

00:01:54.944 --> 00:02:01.190
I've left spots for the x. We have something squared, minus 2 times something,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.052
plus 2. We're going to take g of x, which is 3x minus 5, and use that as our

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:13.126
input. This is how we find a composition f of g of x. We have x as our

00:02:13.126 --> 00:02:18.755
variable, and we finding the output by plugging in g of x into this function.

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:25.886
Squaring this binomial, we get 9x squared minus 30x plus 25. Then we'll

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:30.548
distribute this negative 2 to get negative 6x plus 10, and a positive 2 on the

00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:37.430
end. There's no like terms with 9x squared, so I'll just list that here. Then

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.470
we'll combine the like terms of negative 30x and negative 6x to get negative

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.280
36x. And finally, we'll add 25, 10, and 2, to get positive 37. This is how we

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.200
get our entire composite function.
