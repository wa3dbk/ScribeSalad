00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.070
One of the great things about reading
the Material Design specification

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.689
is that it is presented
using Material Design.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.850
I was immediately struck
by the vivid use of color.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.900
The spec says that color should be
unexpected and vibrant with bold

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.030
hues juxtaposed with muted environments,
deep shadows, and bright highlights.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.050
To help designers, the developers of
Material Design provide a sample palette

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.060
of primary colors for
app developers to choose from.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.160
Using these colors isn't some sort of
requirement, especially Especially if

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.890
your brand already has established
colors, but it's a great starting point.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.740
Material uses the number 500 to
represent the base color for the theme.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.872
500 is in approximately the middle
of the Material palette,

00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:42.979
as in these examples.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.350
You should pick a lighter version of
your color from the same palette in

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.574
the 100 range, and
a darker color in the 700 to 800 range.

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:53.759
I picked the 100 and 700 light blue for

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:58.700
the update to Sunshine, which is
similar to our original palette.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.280
Then you'll want
the contrasting accent color.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.460
To make things easier,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.260
the Material palette definitions
mark accent colors with letter A.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.730
You want to pick an accent
color that contrasts with and

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.500
harmonizes well with
your primary colors.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.760
I chose a shade from the amber palette
because it harmonizes nicely and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.330
matches our icon color.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.880
After all, blue skies and
golden suns are not only friendly,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.940
they are evocative of
our application name.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.610
So, this is the final short color
palette for our application.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.030
Using the support library,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.070
we can easily alter our color
palette to use these new colors.
