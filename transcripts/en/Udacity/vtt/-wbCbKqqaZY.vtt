Let's put D as the header in this column. D for difference. If you figured this

00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:14.398
out yourself, great job. We'll put equals A2 minus B2. And there we have our

00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:19.886
difference. Then we'll copy this cell, 'cuz we'll copy the formula. Go to cell

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:26.920
C26. Highlight the whole column C, and then paste. And we get all our

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.430
differences. Let's calculate the average difference. We get the same thing we

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.870
got for our point estimate of the differences. Now let's calculate the standard

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:47.474
deviation of these. So we have each value, minus the mean. So remember we're

00:00:47.474 --> 00:00:52.570
subtracting a negative number, and then square it. So these are our squared

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.361
deviations from the mean. So we'll sum them up and then divide by n minus 1,

00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:04.744
which is 24. Finally, we'll take the square root. We get about 3.69.
