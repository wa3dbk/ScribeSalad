00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.380
The first part of security planning is
to start doing inventory of our assets.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.500
What is that we have which is of value?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.270
And something that is of value of
course, has to have some risk to it.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.239
So there has to be a threat.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.890
That is the source of that risk that
is faced by this particular asset.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.730
So the service is the software,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.230
the hardware,
these are the assets that we have.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.390
And we have to concern
ourselves about securing them.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.370
So, when you think about cyber security
and planning for it, of course,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.550
you have to worry about
all these assets,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.280
or the list of what needs to be
secured has to include all these.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.610
When you talk about the software,
so this is sort of the hardware.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.998
When it comes to software, we're running
operating systems on these servers,

00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:50.730
or laptops, or mobile devices.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
The databases that store large amounts
of data, perhaps, the services that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.890
are talking about the applications
actually we have on the devices.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.420
Again when it comes to software and
services we have to worry about that.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.660
And of course the databases or
the file systems,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.790
they're storing lots of data,
either structured data or in files.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.780
Some of the data is
going to be sensitive.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.750
Some of it could be highly sensitive.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.730
Could be your Lexile property,
you could in employed accords and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.240
things like that, so of course we
have to say where this data resides.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.570
What kind database, which server,
and are we securing the server,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.420
the database, and
the data that's stored in it.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.490
And whenever you talk about assets and
securing them, securing them from whom?

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.376
Are we concerned about
external attackers or hackers?

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:43.543
They could be cyber criminals.

00:01:43.543 --> 00:01:45.930
They could be motivated for
some other reason.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.995
Activists, for example,
activists perhaps don't like you or

00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:52.375
your business or whatever it is.

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:55.255
So is it remote hackers that concern us,

00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:58.955
when it comes to securing all these
assets that we are talking about?

00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:02.155
Or it's insiders,
it's employees within the organization
