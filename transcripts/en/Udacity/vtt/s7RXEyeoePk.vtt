00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.874
There is a clear business case for
HIE within a healthcare enterprise.

00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:09.611
Make it easy for physicians to refer
patients to the enterprise and

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:13.090
more convenient for patients to
get all their care within it.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.230
In most business activities we assume
bigger is better and more sustainable.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.880
With HIE,
the business case typically gets weaker

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.860
once it expands beyond
a health enterprise.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.640
As a result, for the most part,
regional, statewide and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.100
nationwide HIE remains an economic
as well as a technical challenge.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.110
Can you think of any way wider scale HIE

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.250
could be made more attractive
to healthcare providers?
