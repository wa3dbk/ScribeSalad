00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.828
I want you to look at the toString method that I added to this class. You can

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:07.217
use toString to print out all of the scores. It might help if you find that you

00:00:07.217 --> 00:00:10.060
need to debug a bit. It's also worth spending a moment to look at this

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.460
carefully. The arrays class has a lot of useful methods for working with

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.064
arrays. It's structured a little bit like the math class. So to use these

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:23.545
methods you call Arrays.toString or Arrays.copyOf. Now, if I call

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:27.010
Arrays.toString, and I just gave it the scores, which is a partially filled

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.975
array, it would print out a whole lot of zeroes at the end. And I'm not really

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:35.440
couting those as part of my array right now. So I need to trim down the array

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.073
first. I'm using Arrays.copyOf, to trim down the array. Arrays.copyOf takes the

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:45.819
array that you want to copy and the desired new length. So this method call

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.849
makes a shorter array that is a copy of the original and then when I pass that

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:54.074
to arrays toString it will now return a string representation of only the part

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:58.519
of scores that i am interested in
