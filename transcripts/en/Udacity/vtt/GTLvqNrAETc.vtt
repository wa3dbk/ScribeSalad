00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.860
Let's take a closer look at these two plots. Now, it

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.420
might be hard to determine which gender has more friends on

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.410
average. Remember, that's the question

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.490
we're investigating. Who has more friends,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.110
males or females? So, instead of looking at these histograms, we

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.090
can use the table command to see if there are more

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.770
men versus women. When I run that command, I get this

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.450
output. So, it looks like there's slightly more males than females

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.540
in our sample. To look at the average friend count by gender,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.390
we'll need another new command. This command is the 'by'

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.830
command. The 'by' command takes three inputs: a variable, a categorical

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.740
variable, or a list of indices to subset over, and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.380
a function. In our case, we want to use the Summary

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.730
as the function to get basic statistics on our friend

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.140
count. So, friend count's the variable, gender is our categorical variable,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.890
or the variable that contains our segments of users. And,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.400
we want a summary of the friend count by gender. Now,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.070
I'm not going to run this code, but I want you

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.800
to run it in RStudio and then answer these next questions.
