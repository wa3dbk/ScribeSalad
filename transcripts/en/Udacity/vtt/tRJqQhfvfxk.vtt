00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
Congratulations! You have now learned a lot about solving NP complete problems in practice.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.170
You have learned about search tree optimizations, you have learned about pre-processing,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.600
and you have learned about other techniques such as fixed parameter tractability, and this is huge.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.800
Now, of course, in this unit, I could only teach you the very basic techniques that I use.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.280
So you might be wondering, what is the state of the art for solving NP-complete problems in practice?

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.290
I would like to give you a few examples and numbers.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.240
For vertex cover on practically relevant inputs, you can sometimes find the vertex cover

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.320
progress with over 10,000 vertices for independent set and clique.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.510
Independent sets and cliques have been calculated for many graphs with over 1000 vertices

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.340
and traveling salesman which is very close to shortest tour

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.570
and actually sometimes people also solve shortest tour, so a traveling salesman,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.860
you really have to be specific what kind of problem your are talking about.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.640
But there's one example where somebody solved an instance with ≥85,000 vertices.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.170
Think about what this means for the four computer scientists

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.110
that we met throughout this course so far as started out with not being able to solve vertex cover for

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.730
a graph with 10 or 20 vertices and then she learned about NP completeness.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.230
Her situation was actually quite dire, but then we showed her that there's search tree optimization

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.820
and pre-processing and if those techniques are applied in the right way,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.480
then, Alice can't certainly expect to be able to solve her problem

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.580
if she is working with 500 or 1000 vertices, because the thing is this,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.430
the instances for vertex cover that come up in practice

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.350
are actually much easier to solve than worse case instances.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.780
One example is this, you're practical instances went up to 10,000 vertices.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.640
I think Alice can be pretty happy. What about Bob and Carol?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.170
Bob and Carol, of course, they started out being as unhappy as Alice

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.230
because they also had impractical algorithms and then they found out about NP completeness.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.590
Of course, they can also use search trees and pre-processing,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.450
but their problems turn out to be harder to solve than vertex cover in general.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.560
Even so, I think they should be a little bit happy because for the problems that they try to solve

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.950
in Genetics and in Finance, I think being able to work with about 1000 vertices should be okay.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.800
And again, we have to assume that, of course, they are working with inputs

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.550
that are more easily solvable than worse case inputs but usually in practice, again, that's the case.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.550
What about Dave, who we met very late in this course?

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.360
Well, when we met Dave, we showed a very complex proof that his problem was NP-complete,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.000
so he started out very unhappy as well, I would assume.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.100
And actually I think he stayed unhappy throughout this unit

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.800
because whenever we came across shortest tour or traveling salesman,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.890
we always had to say, well, we're not really quite sure on how to do this.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.370
This is an open research problem.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.320
But then again, since this problem is so highly relevant in practice,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.730
there have been lots of developments regarding sophisticated algorithms

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.510
that work very well in practice, so we can basically put it like this.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.090
From a theoretical perspective, Dave has to be very very unhappy,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.000
but if he uses sophisticated algorithms, then actually Dave can be the happiest of all

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.080
because the algorithms that have been developed for traveling salesman

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.490
work extremely well in practice.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.180
And finally, of course, we should also say a little bit about SAT.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.880
For the satisfiability problem, there are annual competitions and these competitions, of course,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.540
are based on mostly on instances that occur in practice

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.510
than on instances that are deliberately hard.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.210
And yet so, each year, usually instances are solved with over 1000 variables.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.280
Now SAT is a problem that behaves very differently.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.920
So there are some instances of SAT even with 10,000 or 100,000 variables

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.080
that are very very easy to solve because pre-processing is very effective for these instances.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.660
And then there are other instances for SAT that just have a few 100 variables

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.450
that are super super hard to solve, so there, you usually need to try

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.100
a lot of different packages and techniques, but nevertheless,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.510
when you come across an instance of SAT

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.340
and there are certain practical situations but this is the case, then you shouldn't despair.

00:03:54.340 --> 99:59:59.000
SAT, again, if you're working with real world instances, for SAT, it's usually worth a try to solve it.
