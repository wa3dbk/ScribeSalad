00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.020
Kent Beck and Martin Fowler popularized the notion of refactoring as part of

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.680
extreme programming in the 1990s. The idea was to move some design activities

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.700
that were previously done before implementation was started into the actual

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.550
implementation phase of development. The intent was to reduce rework in

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.820
situations with rapidly changing requirements. The first step in refactoring is

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.650
the recognition of bad smells, which are code situations that are suggestive of

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.910
design problems, such as duplicate code, too many comments, or long classes. So

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.680
you can think, bad smells as being, things to avoid in other words,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.000
design principles describing situations which you, you don't want to be in.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.260
The Fowler's book recognizes dozens of bad smells and the avoidance of each

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.110
should be, could be thought of as a design principle. For example, the duplicate

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.570
code bad smell should be thought of as the avoid duplicate code by factoring

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.130
principle. You're encouraged to explore Fowler's book as a way of becoming

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.990
familiar with these situations, it is referenced in the class resources page.
