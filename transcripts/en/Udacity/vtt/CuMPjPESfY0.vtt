00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.850
We're on our way to plotting the conditional means for

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.770
a to months. Remember we're trying to generate this plot again

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.260
but only for smaller bin widths. We'll have more data points

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.790
since age will be measured in months rather than in years.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.850
Now that we've got our age with months variable from

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.440
before we can go ahead and use the d apply r

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.890
functions. To get a new data frame with an average friend

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.580
count. And the median friend count for each age with months.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.750
So here comes your second programming task. Create a new

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.350
data frame called PF.FC by age months that contains the mean

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.050
friend count, the median friend count, and the number of

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.920
users in each group of age with months. There will be

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.290
detailed instructions on this on the next page. And an

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.220
example of what your output should look like. Now this is

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.100
one of the more challenging programming exercises. So if you get

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.940
stuck, check out the instructor notes for two hints. This exercise

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.420
will also be automatically graded and will check the output of your data frame.
