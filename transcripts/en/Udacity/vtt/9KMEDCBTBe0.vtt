00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.379
A key idea to many behavioral therapies is the use of reinforcement to shape

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.409
and change behavior. However, other techniques are used, such as extinction,

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:13.063
and this was used in the study I just talked about with the psychiatric nurse

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:18.844
as a behavioral engineer. They used extinction to decrease symptoms of

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:22.561
schizophrenia, but let's look at a different type of therapy that uses

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:27.944
reinforcement. One successful ABA technique that is used by behavioral

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.870
therapists, is a token economy. And here desired behaviors are reinforced with

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.748
a token. That could be something like a sticker, a star on the board or some

00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:41.381
type of chip. These tokens are accumulated, and can later be exchanged for

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:46.868
other items or privileges. For example, a child with ADHD may be put on a token

00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:50.932
economy. Wherein he gets a token for every homework assignment that he

00:00:50.932 --> 00:00:56.077
completes on time. After he accumulates 5 stars, he gets 10 extra minutes of

00:00:56.077 --> 00:01:01.048
recess. Moreover, if he earns 10 stars he gets to go on the field trip with the

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:06.109
class. The token economy technique has been found to be especially effective in

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:11.216
treating drug addiction. So, let's look at example of that. Steven Higgins and

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:15.704
his colleagues conducted a series of studies, where they gave cocaine dependent

00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:21.830
participants tokens for each drug free urine sample that they provided. In some

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.610
of the studies, the value of the tokens increased for each consecutive drug

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.351
free sample. So for example, perhaps the first token was worth $0.25, if they

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:38.156
provided a drug free urine on the next day it would be increased to $0.50. On

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:43.896
the third day if they provided a drug free sample it would go to $0.75. Now

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:47.172
remember these were just tokens, they didn't earn actual money, and part of

00:01:47.172 --> 00:01:50.448
this was because they wanted to make sure that the tokens could be exchanged

00:01:50.448 --> 00:01:56.344
for appropriate items. Meaning they didn't want to give these individuals money

00:01:56.344 --> 00:02:00.856
and perhaps risk them taking that money and going out and buying drugs. So

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:04.762
again, if drugs were found in the urine, the value of the token decreased to

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:11.008
the original starting value. So again if they had consecutive drug free urines,

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:16.311
the token value increased each time. But if drugs were found in the urine, it

00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:21.906
went back to the original starting value. In these studies the researchers

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:27.165
found a significant decrease in drug using. Especially compared to other

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:32.906
therapies such as narcotics anonimous. These individuals spent longer time

00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:38.510
drug-free, than individuals in those other treatments. Given the success of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.110
these types of studies, this behavioral approach has been listed by the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.010
National Institute of Drug Abuse as the best option for drug addiction, along

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.825
with medication.
