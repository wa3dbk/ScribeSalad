00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.760
For this equation, x can equal negative 3 or 8 3rds. Good job if you got these

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.332
two correct. I hope you're becoming a pro at u substitution. First, we'll

00:00:11.332 --> 00:00:17.031
perform the substitution and let u equal x minus 2. We'll replace x minus 2

00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:21.770
with the variable u. Now that we have this equation, we need to move this 10 to

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.322
the left-hand side. So, we'll have a quadratic equal to 0. We factored this

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:31.878
quadratic expression by finding the factors of negative 30 that sum to positive

00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:39.164
13. Those factors are negative 2 and positive 15. We rewrite the middle term

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:45.720
and then use factoring by grouping to get u plus 5 times 3u minus 2 equal to 0.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.054
We use this factoring to solve for the variable u. So, we can have u equal

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:56.620
negative 5, or u equals 2 3rds. Finally, we use those solutions of u to figure

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.849
out the values of x. This was the original variable in our first equation. So,

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:08.118
since u equals negative 5. x minus 2 equals negative 5. And since u equals 2

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:13.410
3rds, we know that x minus 2 equals 2 3rds. We add 2 to both sides, to each

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:20.076
equation, so x can equal negative 3. Or x can equal 2 and 2 3rds. The mixed

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:25.280
number, or 8 3rds, the improper fraction. Nice problem solving if you got here.
