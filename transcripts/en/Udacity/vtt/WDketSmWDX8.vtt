00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.110
So when going to a networking event,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.390
I think you want to come up with
at least a couple of things.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.710
First, if there's content in this event,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.020
you want to learn at least one thing
that's relevant for your business.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.980
And so you want to go to a networking
event that you can hopefully learn

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.620
something relevant for you.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.769
But the most important thing
is trying to figure out

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.690
specific individuals there that
would be good for your business.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.020
Are there other investors
that can help you?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.850
Are you looking for a co-founder?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.420
It's really about trying to tell
your story in a very succinct way,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.310
so the person across from you
will understand what you do and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.510
hopefully connect.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.530
I think it's not about quantity,
it's really about quality.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.470
Don't try to shake hands with 100
different people for one second.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.870
Try to find those five, six,
seven people that there's a chance

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.750
that they will dramatically influence
the trajectory of your startup.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.990
Because they join you as an employee,
or as an investor, or

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.120
perhaps connect you to
somebody who can be that.
