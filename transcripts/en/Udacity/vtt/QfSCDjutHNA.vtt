I just wanted to say you guys are doing great so far. Congratulations on getting

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:10.028
so far in visualizing algebra. Let's try another factoring trinomial problem. 2a

00:00:10.028 --> 00:00:17.650
cubed b, minus 28a squared b squared, plus 96ab cubed. Don't let the problem

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.663
intimidate you. There's nothing to be afraid of. Just use what you've been

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:24.923
learning to factor this trinomial. You can put your answer over here.
