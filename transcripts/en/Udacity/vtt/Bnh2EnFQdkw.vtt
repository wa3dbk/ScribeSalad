00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.520
The correct answer is the food parameter in the

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.060
URL updates. Let's go ahead and see that in action.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.570
Okay, you can see that we've already got food=steak in

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.010
the URL from the first time that we submitted the

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.460
form, and now when I click add for eggs

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.890
here, the parameter updates in the URL. Now, we've done

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.650
this before, but it's nice to have. A good refresher

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.770
because it's going to get a lit bit more complicated soon.
