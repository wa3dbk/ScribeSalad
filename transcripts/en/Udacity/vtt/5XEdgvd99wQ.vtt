00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.143
So once you have a good
understanding of the problem,

00:00:03.143 --> 00:00:04.851
you move to the define stage.

00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:06.662
Could you tell us
a little bit about that?

00:00:06.662 --> 00:00:08.787
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love the define stage.

00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:14.255
So we started not by rushing to
solutions, but by understanding.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:18.689
Second, we move to something that
would be absolutely amazing and

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.260
favorite for
everyone who likes analysis.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.470
The define stage is about
finding a strategy and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.620
analyzing what is the best path to
actually arrive at the solution.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.295
During this stage, all of the exercises
that someone is familiar with

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:36.361
around product strategy become very,
very applicable.

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.183
Let's list a few examples.

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:42.279
The define stage can be greatly enhanced
if people pause to describe the user

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:46.000
journey that they're working
to create for the user.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.400
A user journey is a storyboard that
helps define the major pieces,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.240
step by step, of someone experiencing
the product for the very first time

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.500
when they don't know anything about it,
towards the time when they become

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.750
a masterful user and they're maybe
even evangelizing it to their friends.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.480
&gt;&gt; So I actually need to write
what the user name is and

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.330
what do they do with the app?

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.959
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great question.

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:14.580
You might not need to have a user
name for the user journey.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.230
What you're trying to find
is what is the most common

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.710
path that someone will take.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.992
&gt;From a perspective of
not knowing anything,

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:23.460
towards being able to use it over and
over again.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.680
Now within that,
there may be other stories.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.140
For example, if you're working on an app
that's reviewing local restaurants,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.580
there may be one journey for
people who are writing the reviews, and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.380
another journey for
people who are reading the reviews.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.830
&gt;From those two, the most common path
would be someone hearing about your app.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.020
Hey, there's this great local app,
this can be in a newspaper,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.990
this can be in a restaurant, and
you need to plan for that, because

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.270
if you don't plan for the discover
moment, it's just not going to happen.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.090
So you look at it as how
are people discovering my app?

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.880
After that, it's about how
are they starting to use it?

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.920
Well, that may mean that they
download it, and then afterwards,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.060
they're starting to search for
restaurants, read about them, and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.610
then they get reminded after
they've been somewhere potentially,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.710
that they need to write a review.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.080
So let's say the most common path.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.270
The user journey has many
names in the industry.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.479
Because design is a relatively
new discipline in technology,

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.212
there have been many different
ways to refer to that.

00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:24.820
Some people refer to the user
journey as a storyboard.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.070
In fact, what we know from
design history is that Disney

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.590
was the first person to use storyboards.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.810
Disney had a team of artists and
technologists who had

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.175
to make the first animated movies
before anyone knew how to make that.

00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:41.165
So in order to keep everybody
on the same page, and

00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:44.155
not to waste money,
he created the storyboard that said,

00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:47.245
moment after moment,
what is happening to his characters.

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:50.925
And that first storyboard, which was
about the movie Snow White, helped

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:55.535
organize his team, and set a precedent
that teams continue to use today.

00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:58.859
So if you're using a storyboard,
you have Disney to thank for that.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.160
&gt;&gt; And a quick follow-up on that, so how
do I know that I have enough stories,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.440
that I've completed all the stories.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.640
&gt;&gt; So this is a great question.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.003
The user journey is the idea that
there's one central story that is

00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:14.092
the most important.

00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:16.125
Another name for
that is the Golden Path.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.650
That actually comes from Microsoft.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.329
In Microsoft, or so the story goes,
the teams refer to the golden path as

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.396
the experience that is absolutely
key for the product to work,

00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:30.258
for the users to come and
get what they want.

00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:33.290
The Golden Path is
supported by red threads.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.340
These are the little stories that help
make it possible, and there can be many,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.647
many little thread such as the user sign
in, potentially the shopping experience.

00:03:41.647 --> 00:03:46.746
But if the Golden Path is your discovery
process then that's what needs to be

00:03:46.746 --> 00:03:52.175
really easy, really key and all efforts
in the company need to be focused there.

00:03:52.175 --> 00:03:58.700
So why is it important to be clear
of one most important user journey?

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.107
Well, we believe that it is
important to prioritize, and

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:06.138
if you don't know what your app is
going to be most commonly used for,

00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:10.264
then it's really difficult to know
how all the other things fall out.

00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:14.016
So, we recommend to always focus
on one central user journey, and

00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:18.600
to make sure that it is easy and
effortless for people to achieve that.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.579
It's important to plan for everything.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.510
We see a lot of startups fail because
they have created a great product but

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.320
they don't have any plan for
how they're going to be discovered.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.300
In that way, they're building
little islands in the ocean, and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.440
there's no line there that will
ever take passengers there.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.942
This is why we remind people,
plan the entire journey.

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:40.541
Plan your product in all of the
different stages, from the time when no

00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:44.210
one knows about it, towards the time
when they're really masterful.
