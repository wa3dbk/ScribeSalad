00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's now come to our programming exercise

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I want you to program exactly what we just talked about.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We're given a two-dimensional world

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where we observe in 2D measurements of a moving object

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with an unknown but fixed velocity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Using a state vector of this type, I'd like you to implement the Kalman filter.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, this Kalman filter now has 4 state variables

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
whereas the one we used before had 2 state variables.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I will give you the entire code for the Kalman filter,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but I want you to set up the state vector x, the motion u, P, F, H, R, and I,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which are all those variables that define the Kalman filter.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Start with the assignment that we had in 2D

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and make it work in 4D.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Here is exactly the same matrix class that I wrote you before.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here is the Kalman filter procedure.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We'll go through our measurements and apply the Kalman filter equations.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I should point out there's a slight difference to the code I gave you previously

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
where I insert a zeta transpose.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It makes it a little bit easier to work with multidimensional measurements than how I had it before.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But you don't have to pay attention to this. It's just fixed. There was a kind of a bug before.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
As I scroll down, the output of the Kalman filter routine will be an x and a P.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In our example, the measurements will be a sequence of measurements

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
in two-dimensional spaces now--in x and y.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Look at the x's 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The y's go 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You can imagine what the regularity is and what the velocity is.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We assume a dt of 0.1.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That means when it goes from 5 to 6 the velocity is actually 10, not 1.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We won't tell the system, but we will tell the system our initial x,y location, which is 4.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
That goes nicely into 5, 6, 7, and it's 12. That blends nicely into 10, 8, and 6.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Our initial state vector I have already given you, which is the initial x and y.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and 0, 0 for the two unknown velocities.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The motion vector, just for completeness, will just be 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We have no external motion.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That's a bit confusing, because there is actually motion in the system itself,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
but this will be more like an external change of the motion

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
as if someone hit the object with an external force.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So it's 0, 0, 0, 0--please don't change it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
P is the initial uncertainty,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and I want you to initialize it so that the uncertainty for the x,y coordinates is zero,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
but the covariance term for the velocities is 1000,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
indicating that we really don't know the initial velocity.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We just know the initial position.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I want you to plug in the f matrix.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I want you to design an H matrix that's a projection matrix

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
from 4-dimensional state space to 2 dimensions,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
reflecting the fact that we can only observe the first two state variables--x and y--

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
but not the velocities.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I want you to define the measurement uncertainty matrix, which now is a 2 x 2

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that has 0.1 as the main diagonal as measurement noise.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
This is an identity matrix over here.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Once you design all those, you should get the following output.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So when I run this, I get as an output

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
for my 4-dimensional example the x coordinates 10 and 0.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
This makes sense given that these sequences over here

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000
has a final measurement 10 and 0--5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10--10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The interesting thing that I want your program to produce is the velocities.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
They are approximately 10, which makes sense given out delta-t of 0.1

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
gives us per time step a 10 divided by 10 equals 1 increment over here.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The second velocity is -20 multiplied by 0.1 gives us a -2.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You can see it over here--10, 8, 6, 4, and 2.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I also want you to output the covariance matrix,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
which has certain elements that are still 0, like these guys over here.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We find that along the main diagonal our uncertainty has shrunk substantially.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It's 0.03 for the coordinate estimates and 0.1 for the velocity estimates.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Remember, this number over here was 1000 before.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Here is a second example where we have an initial coordinate of -4 and 8.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We can see the measurements 1, 6, 11, 16.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It seems the increments are in x direction 5.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In the y direction they are -4--8, 4, 0, -4, -8.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
If I now run this, I get for my x vector approximately 16--the number over here,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
approximately -8--the number over here.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
These are velocities--50 and -40 in approximation,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
which multiplied with 0.1 is our plus 5 and our -4.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Here is yet another example. Initial state 1 and 19.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
You can see the first coordinate doesn't change at all. You should get a velocity of 0.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The second coordinate goes 19, 17, 15, 13, and 11.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Running it gives us 1--unchanged--and 11.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Velocities are 0 and -20 for the decrements of -2.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Going into the covariance, we see values along the main diagonals--

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
0.05, 0.05, 0.33, and 0.33 for the velocities.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
There are certain off-diagonal elements.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Make sure those all match what your code produces.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I can now change some of these measurements to make a noisy measurement.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
One way to do this is to set an oscillating measurement between 2 and 0.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Remember that this Kalman filter assumes a fixed velocity.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There is no way to explain these measurements with a fixed velocity,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
so there has to be measurement noise.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We can run the Kalman filter again.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Your filter should output the following values:

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000
0.7 for the current state, 11 as before, and here are our two velocity estimates.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It actually believes there is a slight velocity of -0.66

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
in the x direction where we had noisy sensor input.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The covariance matrix would look exactly as before,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
because it's not affected by the measurements themselves.

00:06:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Your job is to fill in these various matrices. Good luck.
