00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.680
Looking at the diagram, you can see that we're achieving the exact same thing as

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.939
before but with less repeated code.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.320
The Van and the Cop functions produce the same kinds of objects they always did,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.320
but they're allowing Car function to do most of the work for them first.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.310
But in addition to providing a basis for the Van and the Cop

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.060
constructor functions, the Car function is also a full-fledged class itself.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.480
If my code ever needed to make simple Car objects that lack the more

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.450
specific Van and Cop methods, then we could just call car directly.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.900
And with that we have completed our refractor to include a super class and

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.550
two sub classes.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.270
Interestingly, the car class now looks exactly the way the van class did

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.930
before we introduced the whole idea of cops into our program.
