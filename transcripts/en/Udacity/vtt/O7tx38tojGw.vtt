Well, Susan, I would say
personality psychologist,

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:06.501
because we're looking
at introverts and extroverts.

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:09.244
And I know that personality psychologists
will look at the differences

00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:11.894
between different personality
traits like those two.

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:14.349
And I would guess
cognitive psychologists too,

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.144
because I know they're interested in how
we learn and solve problems. Am I right?

00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:19.783
That's right Lauren, good job.
