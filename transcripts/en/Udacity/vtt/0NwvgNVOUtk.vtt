To close this class, we are talking through a handful of advanced topics,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.500
related to the course material. In this course we already discussed a variety of

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.420
goals, matters and paradigms of knowledge based AI. Now let's close by

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.565
talking through about some of the advanced applications of this content.

00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:20.860
We'll also talk quite a bit about some of the connections with both AI and

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.580
human cognition. Many of the topics we'll discuss today are very broad and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.130
discussion oriented. So we encourage you to carry on the conversation on

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.390
the forums and discuss all the issues that this content raises.
