00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.580
So, now let's get started. Running code in the Python interpreter.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.260
For this class you don't need to install any new software. You

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.840
can run Python right in your web browser, and you should

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.290
see something like this in your web browser once the video stops.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.140
There are two parts to this, there's the environment where you

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.030
can edit code, so let's type code to print 3. So print

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.810
is a Python command that prints something out, and then after

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.180
the print, we can have any expression that we want that is

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.990
valid Python, and we'll talk more about what expressions are

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.360
in Python. Now we're just going to print the number 3,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.660
and when we click Run, it will run this code

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.540
and show us the result down here. And the result of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.630
printing 3, we see the output 3. We can do

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.150
more interesting things. So, we can print an arithmetic expression, so

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.690
I've got 1 plus 1. Now we run this. We

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.265
see both outputs, so first we printed 3, we see the

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:54.100
3 here. Then we printed 1 plus 1. We see

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.170
the result of 1 plus 1 is 2. We can write

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.160
this more clearly by having spaces. We can have spaces

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.180
between the parts of our expressions. So we can have one

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.760
plus one with spaces between there. that's a little easier

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.210
to read, when we run that, we see the same result.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.100
The result is still 2. And we can make more and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.049
more complex expressions, so let's print to result of 52 times

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.970
3 plus 12 times 9. This will print out the result of multiplying

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.030
52 times 3, and adding that to multiplying 12 times 9, and we get 264.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.540
You can check that yourself to see that Python got the right answer. We can use

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.100
parentheses to group expressions. So, if we use parentheses, we can do what

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.630
we did before, but putting parentheses around grouping

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.220
the multiplications and grouping the other multiplication. And we

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.030
run this, we see the same result without the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.930
parentheses, that means the same thing as we had

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.370
when we add the parentheses like this. If

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.310
we put the parenthesis in different places it means

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.650
something different. Now what it means is 52 times

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.330
the result of adding 3 plus 12 which is

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.240
15 times 9. And so we get the result 7020. So we can combine any expressions

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.860
that we want like this. For example if we wanted to compute the number of

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.530
seconds in a year, we can compose many

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.530
multiplications. So we'll multiply 365 days times 24

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.060
hours in a day times 60 minutes in an hour times 60 seconds in a minute.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.310
We can do all those multiplications together and we get

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.140
this result. Which is about 31 and a half million

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.450
seconds in a year. So now it's time for your

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.310
first programming quiz. You've seen enough to be able to write

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.140
a Python program. And your goal is to write a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.180
Python program that prints out the number of minutes there are

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.440
in seven weeks, which is the amount of time we

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.760
have for this course. You'll do that by entering your code

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.120
in here. And then you can try different things.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.730
You can try running the code. See the result.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.750
And then when you've got an answer, you can

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.230
click to submit that answer and see if it's correct.
