00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.246
In previous units, you've learned about the building blocks of GPU computing,

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:09.285
the fundamentals of parallelism, mechanics of writing programs, and techniques for making them fast.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:12.582
However, one of the challenging things about learning a new programming model

00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:16.486
is what happens when you run into a kind of problem you've never seen before.

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:18.629
So what we're going to do in this unit

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:21.356
is look at a variety of interesting problems to solve,

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:25.196
and work through how we might map these problems efficiently onto the GPU.

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:28.874
There's no magic pill that will allow you to instantly think in parallel,

00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:32.613
but what I've found helpful for me is to see a variety of problems

00:00:32.613 --> 00:00:35.255
and how they map to parallel algorithms and data structures.

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:38.744
It helps me have a little broader tool box of techniques and lessons

00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:42.465
that I can use in attacking other problems I may not have seen before,

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:45.265
and I hope the same will be true for you.
