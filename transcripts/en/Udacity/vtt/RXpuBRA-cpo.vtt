00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's now implement something that calculates the value function.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's our familiar grid again.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have a vertical obstacle over here, a T-shaped obstacle over here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Our goal location is in the bottom right corner.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I run it, I get this table over here, which is a little bit hard to read,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because I set the value for each obstacle in the grid to be 99.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So all the 99s over here correspond to actually obstacles in the grid.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
From there on you see that the value of the goal location is 0--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for these two states over here, 6, and so on.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You should implement a function that takes this table as an input

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and computes this table over here, which is unambiguous.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You should be able to output this exact table over here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In fact, if I change the configuration--for example, open up a path over here--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
then your function should compute a very different value function

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
where now we can see the value propagating straight to this line over here,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which wasn't the case before.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Before you implement this, as before I'm giving you the delta table

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
with different actions--up, left, down, and right.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I also give you something we'll be using in a later quiz

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and the cost for the step is supposed to be 1.
