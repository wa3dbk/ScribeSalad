00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.210
That brings us to this specific lesson

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.270
that we're going to cover in this lecture. DFS

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.490
wants to intelligently use the cluster memory

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.070
for the efficient management of the metadata associated

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.100
with the files. And for caching the

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.390
file content cooperatively among the nodes of the

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.339
cluster for satisfying future requests for files.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.420
In other words, what we would like to

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.150
do, is since we know that a disk is slow, we would like to avoid going to the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.870
disk as much as possible. And retrieve the data from the memory of a peer in the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.070
network if in fact that peer has previously

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.570
accessed the same file. And that's the idea behind

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.800
cooperative caching of files. But in order to fully

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.790
appreciate the question that we're asking and the answer

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.360
that we're going to discuss in this lesson,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.140
it is important that you have a very good

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.500
understanding of file systems. If you don't have

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.990
it, don't worry. We have supporting lectures that will

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.880
help you get up to speed, and you can get this knowledge by diving into a good

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.820
under graduate textbook that covers this material well.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.970
And the textbook that is used in the under

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.790
graduate systems course CS 2200 at Georgia Tech is a good resource for that.
