00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.852
One phenomenon that's somewhere between a light and a camera effect is fog. In

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:06.517
the real world, the atmosphere can absorb and reflect light in many different

00:00:06.517 --> 00:00:11.222
ways. 3JS has two simple forms of fog. One is called linear fog and we've been

00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:15.102
using that in a number of demos. A minimum distance is specified for where the

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:19.110
fog starts and the maximum for where the scene is entirely fog-colored.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.798
Anything in between these two distances gets the fog-color blended in. The

00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:26.105
other type of fog is exponential. This is a bit more like real life in that you

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:30.338
specify a density particles. This value effects how the fog increases somewhat

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:33.859
realistically. Both kinds of fog are useful in limiting how far we can see into

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.626
the distance. There's only so much content a program can load and without other

00:00:37.626 --> 00:00:41.650
clever tricks the user will see the limits of the world. There are plenty of

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.070
other types fog and atmospheric effects possible. This demo shows what are

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.844
called god rays, a beams of light type of effect. See the additional course

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:51.899
materials for more about this particular effect, which uses post processing

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.316
image based shaders. To finish up, try out the fog demo that follows. You can

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:59.022
choose from among the different types of fog and change the related parameters

00:00:59.022 --> 00:01:00.310
and fog color.
