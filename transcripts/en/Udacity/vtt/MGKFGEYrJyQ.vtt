00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, gross profit amounts to your total
revenue minus your cost of goods sold.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.240
So that's answer B.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.870
Cost of goods sold may
also be a new term for

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.540
you and this refers to the costs
associated with making your product.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.060
For example, say your business
is selling water bottles,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.410
and this is a water bottle, I promise.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.127
Now, you sell these water bottles for
$19.99.

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:29.260
But it costs you $5.60 to make them.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.314
Your cost of goods sold is then this
$5.60 and when you subtract that from

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:39.307
your total revenue per water bottle,
you get a remainder of $14.39.

00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:42.780
Also known as your gross
profit per water bottle.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.540
Net profit is then your total
revenue after subtracting

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.370
all of your expenses as
an operating business.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.440
Now, keep in mind that this
can easily be a net loss.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.210
And your goal is to implement
a monetization model that

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.410
keeps your numbers positive.
