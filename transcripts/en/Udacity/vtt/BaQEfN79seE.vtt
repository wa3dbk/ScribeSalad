00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.172
Let's go through a few examples. A teacher with a jazz appreciation class says

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.665
that his students really like the jazz music that he's playing. And he

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:13.310
concludes that the class is causing the students to enjoy jazz music. Another

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.652
situation, researches note that drug use is correlated with delinquency. They

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:22.558
conclude drug use causes delinquency and if we reduce drug use, we can also

00:00:22.558 --> 00:00:28.120
decrease delinquency. What's wrong with the logic in each of these situations.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.628
In the case of the jazz music, perhaps students really liked jazz before and

00:00:32.628 --> 00:00:37.994
that's why they took the Jazz Appreciation class. Rather than the jazz

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:42.468
appreciation class causing them to like jazz. For the second situation, it's

00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:48.480
possible that people were delinquent and that's why they started using drugs.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.158
In both of these situations, there's ambiguous temporal precedence. We don't

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:58.382
know which variable occurred first, if it was the class or the appreciation for

00:00:58.382 --> 00:01:04.016
jazz or if there was drug use and then delinquency. Those are just two examples

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:08.710
where we can't infer causality. Here's another one and one that's near and dear

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.528
to my heart as an educator. We found a correlation between SAT scores and

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:18.689
students grades in college. Can we include them that increasing students SAT

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.615
scores will also increase their grades in college? Or what about this one, some

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:28.190
people who commit violent acts played violent video games before committing

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.943
these acts. Therefore these video games caused violence. What are the flaws in

00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:38.684
the logic here, for these two situations? This situation is called a third

00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:43.702
variable problem. It's not necessarily true that high SAT scores resulted in

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:50.146
high grades in college. It could be that motivation, effort, intelligence

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:56.160
etcetera was a third variable that influenced both SAT scores And college

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.320
grades. And this situation's called a post hoc fallacy. Just because a person

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.220
played violent video games before committing a violent act this doesn't mean

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.446
that the violent video games caused the violent acts. It could be that people

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:17.600
who want to commit violent crimes also want to play violent video games. There

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.234
is actually a lot of research on this that I'm unaware of. But certainly a

00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:25.740
simple correlation wouldn't be enough to determine this. Here is the punch

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.383
line. Get it. Just remember, correlation is super-useful but it does not imply

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:35.651
causation.
