00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.770
Epigenetic tags build up with age and silence particular genes. Often times

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.644
these tags are removed, allowing expression of previously silenced genes. Even

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:13.178
identical twins have different experiences and are exposed to different

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:18.523
factors. Think of things like junk food, versus a healthy diet or exercise

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:24.468
versus no exercise, smoking or not smoking. So, their epigenome becomes

00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:28.960
increasingly different with age. This is the reason why one twin may develop

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.915
cancer, become obese or things like that, while the other one won't. They're

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:38.008
genetically identical, but epigenetically, they're different.
