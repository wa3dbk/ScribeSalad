00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.280
Think about an object, just any object.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.420
What part of it takes up
the most space in memory?

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.240
The inside.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.130
It's all the properties it
carries that consume memory.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.110
Is there a way to reduce the amount
of memory an object requires?

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.140
Yes, by emptying it.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.220
Core data objects can
actually be emptied

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.790
as their properties aren't saved inside
the object, but in a database file.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.910
And that's exactly what core data does.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.960
Every core data object starts empty.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.540
That's called a fault.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.420
Whenever the user asks for the contents
of a certain property, that's when core

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.550
data fetch the value from the database,
and it becomes a regular object.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.790
It's just like those old sea monkey ads.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.370
Just add water.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.950
Later on, if that value goes unused for

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.410
a certain time, the object becomes
emptied again and becomes a fault.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.160
This is how core data helps keep your
memory footprint as low as possible and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.040
without any intervention on your part.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.180
This is absolutely vital in
an environment with limited memory,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.540
such as an iOS device.
