00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Consider this spiffy, new finite state machine.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It accepts both 1 or more letters like word--w-o-r-d--and also 1 or more digits--1, 2, 3.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, there's a sense in which it accepts either [a - z]+ or [0 - 9]+.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Note its 2 accepting states. Such power!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Can we do the same thing with regular expressions?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It turns out we can with a new regular expression operator,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
a nubitive syntax in regular expressions that I'm going to teach you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This vertical bar means I match either the thing on the left or the thing on the right.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's formally called 'disjunction' sometimes, but we can just read it as 'or'.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Match [a - z]+ or [0 - 9]+.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For example, let's say we want to find all matches of lowercase [a - z]+ or [0 - 9]+

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in "Goethe 1749".

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We'll get both 'oethe' and '1749'.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We don't get the capital G because we asked for lowercase letters over here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
One of Goethe's most famous works is Faust, in which an old man makes

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
a literal deal with the devil in an incredible surprise move. It does not go particularly well.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And in fact, the phrase Faustian bargain has entered the modern English lexicon

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
meaning a deal that you really don't want to make or where you're giving up too much

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to get something.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
While we're here, our old friend regular expression [0 - 2] is really just 0/1/2.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.263
So I could write out [a - z] as 26 different choices, but that's not very concise.
