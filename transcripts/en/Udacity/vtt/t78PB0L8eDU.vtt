So now, we're going to take a quiz. And this is a little tricky. But, of course,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.332
the whole point is to help you out and get you thinking about measurement. So,

00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:13.830
how did BBC measure memory? Note that we're not asking about factors that

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:18.575
contributed to your score, we're asking specifically how did BBC precisely

00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:19.881
measure memory.

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:24.294
Was it that types of faces you remember? The percent of faces correctly

00:00:24.306 --> 00:00:29.248
recognized and placed from parts 1 and 2? Knowing whether you saw the face first

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.089
or second? Knowing whether or not the face was there? Or the number of faces you

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:34.666
remember.
