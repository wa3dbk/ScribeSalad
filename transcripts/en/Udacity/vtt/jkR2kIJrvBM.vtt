00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.020
The next thing we need to cover is something called the Lie Factor.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.480
The lie-factor is a metric that was created by Edward Tufte

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.060
that describes the integrity of a graphic, or

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.150
how well a graphic actually represents its underlying data.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.950
You compute the lie-factor by dividing the size of the effect,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.970
as shown in the graphic, by the size of the effect shown in the data.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.032
Typically, we want the lie-factor to be within 0.95 and 1.05.

00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:26.190
A lie-factor of one is ideal, because we would have the exact same

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.870
effect shown in the graphic as it is in the data.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.180
But due to some jitter with we how we represent data in graphical form,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.510
having a lie-factor within this range is typically seen as very good.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.050
A visualization with a lie-factor in this range has high integrity, and

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.690
is representing the data accurately.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.640
Now that we know what lie-factor is, how do we calculate it?

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.610
So, let's recall that lie factor measures the difference between

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.080
the effect shown in the graphic and the effect seen in the data.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.050
First, let's look at how we would calculate the size of the effect

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.270
shown in the graphic.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.260
First we'll find the difference by subtracting the second value

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.390
from the first value seen in the graphic.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.620
Then we'll compute the change by dividing by the first value.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.310
We'll need to add absolute value bars here, to account for negative change.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.940
Multiplying this by 100 gives us the change as a percentage.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.140
We apply this method toward the graphic and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.770
the data and then divide this entire quantity to get our overall y factor.
