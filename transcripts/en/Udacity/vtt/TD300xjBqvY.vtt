00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So in this problem set, we're going to try to plot the trajectory of the spaceship

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
by creating functions for its acceleration and its trajectory.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We'll start it out with some helpful information. We'll set the step size to 1 second.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I told you the mass of the earth and giving you the gravitational constant,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which you might recognize as G from the equations in other videos.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We've also already created arrays for you for position and velocity, which right now

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
are filled with zeros and set the initial position and the initial velocity of the spacecraft.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, I'm going to remind you of some information that you've already learned

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that's going to be especially helpful for this problem.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We talked earlier about the equation for the gravitational force between two objects

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that's what this little g here next to the F for force stands for gravity.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This big G in the equation is this gravitational constant that we've given you in the code

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that's multiplied by the mass of the earth and the mass of the spacecraft

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and this is divided by the distance between the earth and the spacecraft squared.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now, this d with a hat over it represents a unit vector that any given vector

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
has a unit vector associated with it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This unit vector, which is denoted by this hat over top of it,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is equal to the original vector itself divided by that vector's magnitude.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So this d with a hat over it up here shows us that the gravitational force

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
has this magnitude and is pointing in this direction,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which is a line pointing from the earth out to the spaceship.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now, if you look back at the code for a second, you'll see that this function that we're asking

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of you to find is actually for acceleration not for force,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but we know that force and acceleration are very intimately related by Newton's second law,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which is that force equals mass times acceleration.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This means in the case that we're considering right now we can find the acceleration of the spaceship

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
by simply taking the equation for force that we just read out and dividing by the mass of the spaceship,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
which leaves us with this expression right here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Your job is to translate this equation into an expression in Python for acceleration

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and then to use that expression along with the information we've given you in a

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Forward Euler Method to describe the position and velocity of the spaceship at any given timestep.
