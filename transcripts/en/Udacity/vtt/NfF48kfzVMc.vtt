00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.860
We're now going to talk about

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.390
the consolidate conditional expression refactoring.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.730
A common situation in code is that you have a set

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.530
of conditionals with the same result. What that means that

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.090
sometimes the code contains a series of conditional checks in which

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.760
each check is different, yet the resulting action is the

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.440
same. In these cases, the code could be improved by combining

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.100
the conditionals using, for example, and, and or, as connectors. So

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.390
as to have a single conditional check, with a single result.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.500
At that point you can also extract those conditional into a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.310
method. And replace the conditional with a call, to debt matter consolidating

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.110
the conditional code in this way can make the checks clearer

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.170
by showing that you're really making a single check rather than multiple

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.150
checks, and extracted that condition and having that matter instead of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.550
a condition can clarify your code by explaining why you're doing a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.350
given check, rather than how you're doing it. You can see an

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.020
example of that situation in this code, which is the disabilityAmount method.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.580
As the name of the method says, the purpose of this code

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.300
is to compute the disability amount for a given, for example, employee.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.250
And there is a set of initial checks in the methods whose

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.090
goal is to decide whether there's this disabilityAmount should be instead zero.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.750
And as you can see, there's multiple conditions. For example, there's a

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.630
check about the seniority level, and about the number of months that

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.350
the employee's been disabled. So far, whether the employee is part time

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.060
and the outcome of all these check is always the same. If they're

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.740
true, if the check is satisfied then there is no disability

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.564
amount. So the disabilityAmount is zero. So what I will do

00:01:22.564 --> 00:01:25.986
if I apply the consolidate conditional expression to this matter, is

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:29.690
that I will take these three conditionals. I will put them together

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.772
by saying basically that if seniority is less than 2 or

00:01:32.772 --> 00:01:36.524
monthsDisabled is greater than 12 or isPartTime is true then the

00:01:36.524 --> 00:01:40.170
return should be zero. And once I have this combined conditional,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.601
as I see here, I will just extract that into a method.
