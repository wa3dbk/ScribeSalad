00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
The correct answer here is that the total number of vertices to represent the variables

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.970
is 3&lt;i&gt;(n+1+2), so the number of vertices to represent one variable times n.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:22.020
We have 3(n+1)+2 and the whole thing times n, which is equal to 3mn+5n.

00:00:22.020 --> 99:59:59.000
We have 5n, 0m, 3mn, and a constant of 0 here again.
