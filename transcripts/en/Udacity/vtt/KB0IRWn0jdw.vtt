00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.430
With respect to the three other solutions, we have advantages and

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.280
disadvantages as well.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.160
As far as the ADT, Abstract Data Type solution, it's very good,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.520
as far as maintainability and reuse.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.560
Those particular components could be used in other applications by just,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.450
just plucking them out.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.780
Remember, they've hidden away details.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.425
On the other hand because things are hidden away you have to

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:28.790
invoke them through function call interfaces which might be more expensive, so

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.010
you might pay a price in performance.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.065
With respect to implicit implication,

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:38.160
okay it has also maintainability advantages.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.480
If you change the representation because the, the, the clients and the servers

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.720
don't know much about each other you only have to change them in one place.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.300
You don't have to change change the others, which also facilitates reuse.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.440
On the other hand, because it's implicit invocation and

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.700
you don't know who you're talking to a lot of times,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.810
it's sometimes difficult to think about or control what's going on.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.300
And if you had to do some kind of debugging it might be tricky to know,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.100
you know, which of the components was responsible for some kind of problem.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.670
Also, as with the ADT solution, because you have these more or

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.610
less abstract interfaces between things there may be a performance hit.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760
With respect to pipe and filter, pipe and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.450
filter is very intuitive, easy to think about.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.690
It's also easy to reuse because each of the filters along the way,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.150
you can plunk out and put into another, another solution.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.320
On the other hand if we wanted to make changes,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.570
such as making the system interactive pipe and filter wouldn't work at all.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.510
It, it's going to stream things, stream things through.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.000
also, it's not particularly space efficient because you have

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.050
no no place for you to store the data, which means you

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.590
might have multiple copies of that data floating around as you're processing.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.410
So, each of the particular solutions has advantages and disadvantages, and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.280
in any particular sit, situation you want to look at what's important to you.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.810
Is performance important?

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.139
Is memory footprint important?

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.975
And, pick a solution that has the particular advantages that you need and

00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.310
avoids the particular disadvantages that might bother you.
