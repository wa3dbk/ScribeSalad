00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.674
So one very popular approach would be to

00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:06.192
combine the magnetic disks with Flash. The magnetic

00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:08.784
disk is very cheap per gigabyte compared to

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:12.700
flash. We know how to build huge capacity magnetic

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.610
disks in a relatively small package, but it's

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.910
very power hungry. It spends and consumes power

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.830
even when not accessing data. And it's very

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.850
slow because it has to mechanically move things around

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.496
in order to access data. And another disadvantage of

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.646
magnetic disks is that they are sensitive to impact.

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:34.851
Like if they fall down and hit the ground,

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:38.127
while they are spinning, because their heads are then likely

00:00:38.127 --> 00:00:40.773
to scratch the surface of the disk and permanently

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.545
damage the whole track possibly, and maybe the head

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:47.592
itself. Flash on the other hand, is fast, power

00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:50.870
efficient, and has no moving parts. So if it falls

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.140
down, it might get damaged, but it's very unlikely. So the idea is to have both

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.050
of them, and use the flash effectively as a cache for the disk. That way most

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.760
of the data is on the disk, but the data we're frequently accessing is on the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.370
flash where it's fast, it can be accessed

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.180
without moving parts, and it can be accessed

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.774
very efficiently. Now of course the disk would still

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:22.972
be spinning if we occasionally access it, but if

00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:25.546
we have enough flash to access data in it

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:28.354
for even minutes at a time, we can actually

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:31.006
power down the disk and spin it down, and

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.658
only really access it once we have a flash

00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:37.816
miss. And because both of these can keep their

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:41.864
data without power, if we turn off power suddenly,

00:01:41.864 --> 00:01:45.360
the data in the flash will still survive, and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.813
so will the data on the disk. Unlike for

00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:51.091
example, if we use a magnetic disk with a

00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:54.080
DRAM cache to keep the most recently accessed data.
