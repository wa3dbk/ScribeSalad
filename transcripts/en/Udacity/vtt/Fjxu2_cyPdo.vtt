The first part of understanding good design, is

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.640
being a good observer. To help you become a

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.450
skilled observer of design. This course consists of

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.420
several observation exercises. For your first exercise, I want

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.660
you to take a photo of a design you think is understandable. And a photo of a

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.676
design you find confusing. Answer the following questions. What

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:25.573
made the understandable design, understandable? What made the confusing

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:28.800
example, confusing? Please share your examples

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950
and reflection, on the course discussion forum.
