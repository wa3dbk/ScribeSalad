00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.620
Here our solution is plus or minus three i an imaginary solution, pretty cool.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.570
We take the square root of both sides to get x is equal to plus or minus the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.802
square root of negative nine. Now we've simplified this radical and remember

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:19.230
that negative square roots, need to be simplified using i. We can break this

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.670
radical down into the square root of 9 times the square root of negative 1.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.071
Then we replace the square root of negative 1 with i. We can also check our

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:33.834
result. We know the answers are not 3 and negative 3. Since 3 squared would

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:38.528
equal positive 9 not negative 9. Also at negative 3 squared would be positive

00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:42.672
9. Not negative nine like we want in our equation. So since these answers are

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:48.020
out, let's make sure the plus or minus 3i works in our equation. I'm going to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.554
check our positive 3i here in this equation and our negative 3i here in this

00:00:51.554 --> 00:00:56.741
equation. When we square the quantity of 3i, we get 3 squared which is 9 and i

00:00:56.741 --> 00:01:03.078
squared. When we square negative 3i negative 3 times negative 3 is positive 9,

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:08.410
and i squared is i squared. And remember back from before, i squared equals

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.990
negative 1. So we can substitute that in here. This effectively changes the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.052
sign of these terms. This gives us a check of negative 9 equal to negative 9 in

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:23.100
both cases. So we could be confident knowing that our answers are correct.
