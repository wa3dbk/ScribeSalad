00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.930
Now let's take a look at the profile form class in the form package. You

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.546
see it finds fields display name, and t-shirt

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:15.250
size. It also defines enum's limit the t-shirt

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.120
size, because there is only a certain

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.170
range of values for t-shirt size. We're going

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.030
to update the safe profile method in conference

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.620
API, to restrict the input data to display

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.200
name and tee shirt size. it's easy to do

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.420
that simply by specifying profile form as the input data

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.710
argument. So here I'm looking at the save profile

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.960
method in the conference API class, and you'll see I've

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.330
passed in profile form as an argument. So, now

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.080
that we pass a profile form into the save profile

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.730
method, we need to use it. So, I've added the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.760
code to get the display name out of the profile

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.800
form, and also to get the t-shirt size out of

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.760
the profile form. For the T shirt size, we only

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.440
want to set it if the profile form actually sent

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.760
it, so we added the conditional check that it's not

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.960
now. For the display name, I'm not adding that extra

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.540
check because later on, we'll be setting a default display

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.210
name based on the user's email, but we don't know

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.190
that just yet. Now we can try out our changes.
