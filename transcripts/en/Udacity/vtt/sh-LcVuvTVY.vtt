00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's find out what the right answers are.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Fibonacci of 6 = 8.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, if N is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We said that Fibonacci of N was 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It does look like Fibonacci of 6 = 8. Great!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Is Fibonacci of N always &lt; or = N + 1?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, 1 is &lt; or = to 2. 2 is &lt; or = 3.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
1 &lt; or = 1. 5 &lt; or = 8.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is certainly true.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The Fibonacci sequence is strictly nondecreasing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It either stays the same or gets bigger.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This next one was a bit of a ringer--a bit of a trick.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The vast majority of the time, almost always, albeit finitely often,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Fibonacci of N is strictly &gt; than Fibonacci of N + 1, except right here at the start

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
when Fibonacci of 1 and Fibonacci of 2 are both 1, so they're = rather than &lt;.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So no dice there.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Is Fibonacci of 20 &gt; 1000?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Yes. The sequence grows super fast.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's just go check.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll just write out the definition of Fibonacci right here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm declaring a procedure called fibo. It takes an argument n.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here's our base case: if n &lt; or = to 2, return 1.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Otherwise, we call ourselves recursively 2 times.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And the answer is 6,765. Wow! That's immense.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Notably, it's bigger than the 1000 we were asking about.

00:01:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
True!
