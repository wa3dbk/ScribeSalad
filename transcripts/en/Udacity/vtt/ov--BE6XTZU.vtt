The GG pairs function uses a different plot type for

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.180
different types of combinations of variables. Hence, we have histograms here

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.200
and we have scatter plots here. Many of these plots

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.580
aren't quite as nice as they would be if we fine-tuned

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.540
them for the particular variables. For example, for all the

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.010
counts of likes, we might want to work on a logarithmic scale.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.970
But, GG Pairs doesn't do this for us. At the very

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.640
least, a scatter plot matrix can be a useful starting point

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.780
in many analyses.
