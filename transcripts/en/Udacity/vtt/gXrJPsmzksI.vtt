Alright, now that we've seen this in action, let's go ahead and use it ourselves.

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:09.155
What I'd like you to do is create a new canvas DOM object inside a

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:14.110
new div DOM object, that is then put inside the body element. To do this, we're

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:17.592
going to have to grab the body element by its id of body.

00:00:17.592 --> 00:00:21.750
We're going to have to create a new element, using document.createElement,

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:27.646
both for the div and for the canvas, then we'd like to set their ids. For the div,

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:32.607
we'll set it to gameContent and for the canvas we'll set it to gameCanvas.

00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:37.228
Finally, we'll have to append both of those, the canvas to the div, and then the

00:00:37.228 --> 00:00:41.398
div to the body. You'll have to use document.getElementById,

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:47.284
document.createElement, the appendChild method of DOM objects, and the id

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:48.988
property to do all of this.
