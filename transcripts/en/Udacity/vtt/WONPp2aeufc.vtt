00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.800
In a streaming video system, where the server

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.210
streams stored audio and video, the server stores

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.010
the audio or video files, the client requests

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.170
the files and plays them as they download.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.329
It's important to play the data at the

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.520
right time. The server can divide the data

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.880
into segments and then label each segment with

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.230
a time stamp. Indicating the time at which

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.020
that particular segment should be played so the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.550
client knows when to play that data. The data

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.390
must arrive at the client quickly enough, otherwise the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.630
client can't keep playing. The solution is to have

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.250
a client use what's called a playout buffer,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.430
where the client stores data as it arrives from

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.650
the server, and plays the data for the user

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.420
in a continuous fashion. Thus, data might arrive more

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.050
slowly or more quickly from the server, but

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.870
as long as the client is playing data out

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.580
of the buffer at a continuous rate, the

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.160
user sees a smooth playout. A client may typically

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.130
wait a few seconds before it starts playing

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.790
the stream to allow data to be built up

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.450
in this buffer. To account for cases when the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.610
server might have times where it is not sending

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.760
at a rate that's sufficient to satisfy the client's playout rate.
