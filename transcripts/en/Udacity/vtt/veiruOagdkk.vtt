00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.820
To find the commit which reverted the controls, first I'll type git log.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.750
Now, I don't see a commit with the message revert controls yet, so

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.090
I'll press the down arrow and scroll down.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.870
And here it is.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.160
Since I found it, I'll press Q to quit out of git log.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.100
So this is the commit ID of the commit that reverted the controls.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.670
It starts with b067.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.120
Now I want to see how many lines were introduced in this commit.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.490
Remember that the changes introduced by this commit will be

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.980
different from the previous commit.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.250
So, I can copy this commit ID, type git diff and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.740
paste it, and then I'll copy and paste this commit ID.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.870
Now I can just count up the lines that have changed.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.600
So far, there's two insertions and two deletions.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.230
We'll scroll down.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.440
Another insertion and deletion, so that's three each.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.550
Another, so four each.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.860
And I'll press Q to quit git diff.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.610
So, the correct commit ID started with b067 and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.140
there were four lines added and four lines deleted by that commit.
