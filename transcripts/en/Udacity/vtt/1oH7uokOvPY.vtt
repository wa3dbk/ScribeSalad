00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.090
At this point you should have most
of the server side, Firebase, and

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.440
Google stuff set up.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.150
So let's go back to our Android app and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.450
talk about what we need to do to
get that ready for Google login.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.110
The big picture goal is to get
an OAuth token from Google and

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.300
then hand that token over to Firebase.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.400
And this is all going to
happen Android app side.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.970
Once you've gotten your OAuth token,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.910
the process is very similar to
logging in with email and password.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.195
You call Auth with OAuth token, then
Firebase uses the OAuth token to get

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:31.692
data from Google, after which Firebase
creates for you that handy JWT, and

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:33.681
of course your AuthData object.

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:36.025
And then finally you get
your AuthData object so

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:37.848
that you can update your android UI.

00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:40.869
Now getting an OAuth token from
Google requires a fair amount of

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:41.842
boilerplate code.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.697
And I've linked to Google
authentication example, so

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:45.510
you can take a look through it.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.740
Let's take a quick look at
what's going on in our app.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.950
Okay, so
I'm in the LoginActivity class, and

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.090
if you scroll down you'll see that here,
prefaced by this large comment,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.340
is all of the boilerplate code
that I took to get the token.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.150
So really all this code is just
to get that OAuth token and

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.550
it's nothing too special but
you can read through it.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.510
Now, I've left the interesting
part of connecting the OAuth token

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.360
to Firebase for you to do.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.920
Now, there are more things that you need
to do with Google which are outlined in

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.030
the Firebase and Google Authentication
to be able to get that token.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.000
These include adding some libraries to
Gradle, generating a config file, and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.690
adding permissions to the manifest.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.670
I'll provide you with
the links in the spec document

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.230
with how to set all of that up.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.140
Once you've got the OAuth token, signing
into Google is almost exactly the same

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.050
as signing in with email and password.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.330
Instead of an email and password,
though, you provide the provider name

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.640
which in this case is Google and
that special OAuth Token.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.106
The result handler works
exactly the same though.

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:45.600
If the user is logged into Google and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.190
give shopping list plus plus all the
correct permissions then onAuthenticator

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.950
will be called and you'll have that
handy dandy authData parameter.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.980
You should do the same thing with
a user who logs in via Google

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.460
as a user who logs in with email and
password.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.340
Your app should send them
to the main activity and

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.040
not take them back to the login
page if they click the back button.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.000
Okay, let me send you the spec.
