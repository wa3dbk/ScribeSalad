00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.824
Light makes right. I love this little play on words that Andrew Glassner made

00:00:03.824 --> 00:00:07.495
up back in the 1980s. It succinctly captures a kernel of truth about computer

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:10.222
graphics. The more you can determine about how light moves through an

00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:13.520
environment, the better your results will be. I've talked a bit before about

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.352
light, and how it bounces around a scene, eventually reaching the eye. The idea

00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:21.499
is that each light, often called an emitter, sends photons out. The fate of

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.107
each photon is that it's absorbed as is, or reflected. An object can absorb

00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:28.650
light and in fact, almost everything absorbs at least a little light. Not even

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.610
the highest quality mirror reflects 100% of the light hitting it. The numbers

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.523
are usually more in the 90 to 95% range. Along the way photons can be absorbed

00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:40.204
by dust, water droplet's, or other particles in the air. Or the inside of

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:43.845
translucent objects themselves. This simple photon model ignores various

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:47.750
effects such as polarization and fluorescence. But that's generally fine in

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.530
indirective computer graphics. Things are complex enough. We can see objects

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.780
precisely because photons ultimately travel from them to us. The reason objects

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.525
have different colors is that each varies in how much it reflects various

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:02.043
wavelengths of light. Where we do have some choice in computer graphics is what

00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:05.455
light paths we follow. The two paths we've used so far are light to surface and

00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:08.892
surface to eye. We've been a bit more elaborate with surface to eye in that

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:12.599
we've allowed transparent filters along this path to modify the color.
