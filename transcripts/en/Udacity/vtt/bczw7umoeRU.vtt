00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So let's go through them 1 by 1.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.630
Finding a polynomial-time algorithm for an NP-compete problem, yes.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.240
That would show that P=NP because the problem is NP-complete.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.280
So it means it's among the hardest-to-solve problems in NP.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.550
So polynomial-time algorithm for this problem will solve

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.580
any other NP-complete problem in polynomial time as well.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.060
Finding an algorithm that solves an NP-complete problem

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.180
in polynomial time on average.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.740
Now, that's a very interesting one, because you might be inclined to think,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.570
"Well, if it solves an NP-complete problem

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.190
in polynomial time on average, then probably that is sufficient."

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.960
Well, it shows a lot of interesting things, but it doesn't show anything

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.860
with respect to P being = to NP, or P being ≠ to NP.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.800
Now, showing that the most efficient algorithm for clique requires exponential time,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.900
that would show that P≠NP.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.850
Because clique is contained in NP, so if it requires exponential time,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.360
it means that there's at least 1 problem, namely clique, that is contained in NP but not in P.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.610
Of course, as nice as it would be to show this, of course,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.820
it would also be quite difficult to prove this because you would have to show that,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.570
again, no matter what algorithm you come up with,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.060
it always requires exponential time.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.070
That would be hard to do because you would have to consider any algorithm,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.290
even algorithms that haven't been invented yet, so to say.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.320
Now, showing that vertex cover has an exponential number of potential solutions,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.090
that is similar to the example I pointed out to you in the beginning of this unit,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.370
namely, that just having an exponential number of potential solutions

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.230
does not mean that the problem is hard.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.810
It can mean that the problem is hard, but as you've seen

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.100
in the case of shortest path, it's not necessarily so.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.630
Now, reducing clique to shortest path versus reducing shortest path to clique,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.460
then you have to remember again what reduction means.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.560
So if you reduce clique to shortest path, it means that solving the shortest path problem

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.910
is also capable of also solving the clique problem.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.710
And since shortest path is solvable in polynomial time,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.040
if you manage to reduce clique to shortest path,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.530
that would show that P=NP.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.050
If, on the other hand, you manage to reduce shortest path to clique,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.460
that doesn't really have any implications

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.390
because all you've shown is that shortest path is an easier problem than clique,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.760
which is something we already know.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.530
Now if you look at all of these solutions, well, of course, it's a bit of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.310
a subjective selection here, but what you'll see,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.560
that showing that P=NP in a way would be quite easy.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.740
All you have to do is find 1 single polynomial-time algorithm for an NP-complete problem.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.850
Then you have immediately shown that P=NP.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.900
On the other hand, if you want to show that P≠NP, then you have to put in a lot of work,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.390
because you have to consider any possible algorithm,

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.000
no matter how complex, how intelligent, how sophisticated,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.680
and still somehow make the case that this algorithm is not able

00:02:55.680 --> 99:59:59.000
to solve a problem like clique in polynomial time.
