00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The interesting thing about the customer development process

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
ties back into agile engineering and agile development hand and glove.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Basically it's this notion of the minimum viable product.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Back in the old days what we used to do is specify

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the entire feature set of the product

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
from beginning to end.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, this makes sense when you're in a large company

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
releasing version 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
because you kind of have a feeling of who the customers are and what they need,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so a product manager can be pretty accurate about

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I've been interacting with customers for the last year and a half,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and I think I know what they need.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But in a startup you're really kind of guessing,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and the odds are you're going to be guessing wrong,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so rather than waste a whole ton of time and money

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
why don't we actually get outside the building before we build something

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and waste a lot of engineering time, and more importantly,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
cash, because that's what puts startups out of business is running out of money.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We want to make sure that we actually listen to the people

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
who eventually will buy this product.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We want to make sure we satisfy their wants and needs.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Why don't we just figure out how to build the minimum viable product?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Build the minimum features in order to get feedback.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, feedback could take the form of input verbally,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or they gave you early orders, or they gave you anything that was valuable

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in helping you come to closure on what should we be building in what order?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And by the way, an MVP could be something as simple on the Web

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
as a wireframe or a PowerPoint slide,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
or for physical products it could be a physical mockup,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or it could be a working part of the system.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But as you get more feedback you could start adding more features.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
One caveat is a comment I always get is

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
"Steve Jobs didn't build the iPhone by asking customers."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And we really doubt Henry Ford asked customers

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
do they want a car before one existed.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, in his case if you would have asked people about what they wanted

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
they would have said a faster horse or one with 6 legs.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And so the immediate response is "Well, therefore for new products

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
you just don't get out of the building at all," and that's just a fallacy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There is a type of startup in what we call a new market,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and we'll be describing new markets in the Customer Segments lecture.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But just understand that in new markets of course you don't get out

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and ask people what features they need.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But you do want to understand how is their day in a life

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
different today versus the day after you give them your new product?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
How does their world change?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And there's no possible way sitting locked in your conference room

00:02:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or your office you would know that without talking to customers.
