00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.892
We want the quantity x squared plus 2x minus 35, which is equivalent to the

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:09.778
product of x plus 7 and x minus 5. To be either less than 0 or equal to 0, which

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:14.804
corresponds to these 3 squares right here. The intervals that go with those rows

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:18.952
are x equals negative 7, negative 7 is less than x is less than 5 and x equals

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:23.692
5. 5 that gives us the inequality negative 7 is less than or equal to x, which

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:28.060
is less than or equal to 5, awesome. That means that any values of x from

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.825
negative 7 to 5 including those 2 numbers, work to make this inequality true.
