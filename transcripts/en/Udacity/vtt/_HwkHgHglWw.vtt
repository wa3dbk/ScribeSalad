00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
Throughout the course, we repeatedly mention that regular

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.950
expression libraries simply use finite state machines underneath.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.140
So, in this last problem, we've asked you

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.060
to implement the lexer, parser and interpreter for

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.450
a basic regular expression library. So, given a

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.570
regular expression as a string, you need to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.570
generate a non-deterministic finite state machine. That accepts

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.670
the same exact strings as that regular expression.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.600
So, this is going to be a lot of code, and I'm

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.660
not going to go through it line by line. But I'll give

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.910
you an overview for one way to solve it. So, here I

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.310
have a solution. Here's our five types of tokens, and four of which

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.160
are defined right here and the letter is defined in the regular

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.650
expression. Then we have our typical ignore and error rules. And here we

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.270
have the precedence ordering for regular expressions, and then our parse rules.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.990
These should all look pretty straightforward,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.150
although you could have organized your abstract

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.310
syntax tree any way you wanted. And here's the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.468
core of the solution, and that is the interpreter. We

00:00:57.468 --> 00:01:00.658
have, basically, three helper functions. To help us generate a

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:04.370
non-deterministic finite state machine out of our abstract syntax tree

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.470
that came out of our parser. We have one that

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.270
adds edges to the finite state machine, one that creates

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.707
new states, and the last one that walks the abstract

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:16.260
syntax tree. So, if we see a letter on its

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.870
own, that means we're going to have to take a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.390
transition to the next state. If we have two entities

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.990
concatenated, we're going to have to go from the current

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.710
state we're at to some middle state, and then lastly,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.186
to the goal state. We have a bar, that means

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:35.684
we're going to go two possible directions in our finite

00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:38.420
state machine. And a star is going to loop back

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.760
on itself. In our function that does all the magic,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.740
lex is the input, takes out the parse tree using our parser,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.440
and then interprets the parse tree,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.710
returning the finite state machine that resulted.
