00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.250
If you're still here,
I'll assume that means that

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.490
you've decided that you
are ready to take this course.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.450
And in which case I'll say again,
welcome to educational technology.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.230
I'm really glad to have you here.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.600
But before we get started
with this course,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.050
there's something that's very
important to understand.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.280
This is a course about
educational technology, but

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.670
it's also very much an experiment
in educational technology.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.950
I know of other courses online
that have a lot of discussions or

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.530
are built around projects.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.330
But I don't know of any that go
quite as far as we're going to go.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.340
This is really an experiment to see
what educational technology can do.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.450
We're going to try some things in
this course that will fail miserably.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.440
We're also going to try some things
that will work out really well and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.960
that we should implement in
other courses going forward.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.310
Part of your role as a student in this
course is to give us feedback on that.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.010
What's working?

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.800
What's not?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.710
What should we fix and what should
we carry on into other courses?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.720
That's part of your
participation in this class.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.370
The learning goals of this
class are to learn about

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.540
what educational technology can do.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.510
And so you need to give us feedback on
what educational technology is doing.
