00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.380
So we looked at that program,
what it does, what input it takes,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.600
how does it execute on the different
values for the input that we provide it.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.978
But to really understand how we actually
take this buffer overflow to its

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:20.570
logical conclusion, which is actually
getting control of this program.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.615
We need to actually look carefully
at how data is stored on the stack.

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.315
What is the layout of the stack?

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:33.655
So remember I told you the stack grows
from high addresses to low addresses.

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:37.375
So we are at some address, and
as you put more stuff on it,

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:38.735
we are going to lower addresses.

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:42.400
So as we go down the stack,
as we push things on to the stack,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.610
we get to lower and lower addresses and
that's what I meant by the stack

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.010
growing from high addresses to
low addresses or growing up few.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.520
Think of your address base starting
at zero and going to the max.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.410
Then the stack growth is from
higher to lower addresses.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.480
And lower addresses are higher or up.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.620
So that's why we're saying
it grows in that direction.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.959
So when you make the function call,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.010
we're going to push the arguments argcr,
with the arguments.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.180
So we are assuming this is
what the compiler does.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.750
You make a function call in
your programming language.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.210
First thing it does it's going to push.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.960
So wherever stack pointer is pointing,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.415
we push this argument
that takes 4 bytes.

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:25.710
So the place it points to the address
where the stack pointer is pointing is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.250
address 4 addr- 4.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.250
Then we push argv and at this point
we have to push the return address.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.310
Remember we have to know where
the return address is, so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.780
when we finish executing this function
we can go back to where we came from.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.660
You then push the return address, so

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.160
the compiler generates code
to push the arguments.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.500
And then you make a function call or
you make a call.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.290
And typically the hardware
pushes the return address onto

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.330
the stack wherever the stack
pointer is pointing.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.134
That goes and then we get to the stack
pointer and we decrement the stack

00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:04.100
pointer by 4 because the return
address [INAUDIBLE] takes 4 bytes.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.110
So now we're going to allocate space for

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.949
the local variables,
allowlogin takes four bytes.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.990
12 bytes strings take 12
bytes that we have here.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.146
So each of password string and
target password we have 12 bytes each.

00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:23.954
So, you made the call, if the stack
pointer was pointing to Addr,

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:29.453
then I can say, well the address
of allowed login is Addr-12

00:02:29.453 --> 00:02:35.110
because 4 for argc, 4 for
argv, 4 for return address.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.270
Already occupied these 12 locations, so

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.720
the stack pointer has
to move beyond those.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.270
And it does that by
moving 12 bytes up and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.310
as it goes up to lower addresses,
we're doing the subtraction that I said.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.260
So, now if you look here there's
a couple of interesting things.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.040
This is password string isn't it?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.330
It's allocated space starting here.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.710
If it's less than 12 bytes,
the input we provide,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.580
it's going to stay within these 12
bytes that we allocated for it.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.940
So this is the starting address, so
if the variable is that address,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.330
address +1, +2,
it goes like that every byte you store.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.800
So these are the higher
addresses we were talking about.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.630
So, password strings start here,
if it's less than 12 bytes,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.520
it's only going to go
into these 12 bytes.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.740
What happens if it's
longer than 12 bytes?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.340
Some of the examples that we
did when we set it to 16 or

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.390
something like that,
it's going to exhaust these 12 bytes.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.910
It's going to overwrite
the allowlogin and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.060
if it's more than 16
what is it going to do?

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.220
It's going to overwrite
the return address.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.240
So the way these things
are let out on the stack,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.730
remember our password string
variable address starts here.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.960
And as we provide some number of
characters it starts storing them.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.640
If they're less than 12 we're good.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.990
If they're more than 12 we're first
going to overwrite allow login.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.870
Then we're going to
overwrite return address.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.610
Then we're going to corrupt the argument
values and things like that.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.540
Now we can say well,
what if I give more than 12 bytes.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.910
We earlier said 16 or
ending whatever it is.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.750
We know that if it's more than 12,
it's going to all flow into this.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.060
This is what it is going to all flow as.
