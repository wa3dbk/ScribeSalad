00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.280
Here's your assignment. Add a slider that controls the field of view parameter

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.160
for the perspective camera. Use the dat.GUI library to set up the slider. Give

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.568
the slider the name Field of View. This Field of View slider should have a

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:17.236
range of 1 to 179 degrees, and start at 40 degrees. When you're done, the

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:20.595
program should look like this. As you change the view, things should look

00:00:20.595 --> 00:00:23.749
considerably different. Once you have things working, I recommend you try

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.262
moving around the scene. Compare changing the field of view with what happens

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:30.540
when you use the mouse wheel or middle mouse button to move back and forth.
