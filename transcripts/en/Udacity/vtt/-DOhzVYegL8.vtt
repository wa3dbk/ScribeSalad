Great job!

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.540
You applied the clicks to
make forms faster and better.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.500
&gt;&gt; You applied the principles
of short forms.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.370
You didn't ask for
redundant information.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.230
You simplified.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.590
You gave feedback.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.879
And you tried out location
services to help with addresses.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.190
Now it is on to the next lesson
where you'll focus on touch.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.550
Remember your mobile users
are incredibly important so

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.750
we want to create touch
interaction that users will love.
