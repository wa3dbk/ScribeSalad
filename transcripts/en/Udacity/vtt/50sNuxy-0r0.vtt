00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.364
We're trying to develop a linear equation based off of two points of data that

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:08.705
we have. Remembering that our graphs earlier had c on the horizontal axis and n

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:13.244
on the vertical axis, we can translate this information into two points. We have

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:17.660
the point 20,14,000 and the point 80, 2,000, we can now use these two points to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.007
find the slope of a line connecting them and then pick one of these two points

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.812
to use with the slope in the point-slope form. The slope of the line connecting

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:31.647
these two points, we can find is negative 200. I chose to use the point 80,

00:00:31.647 --> 00:00:36.847
2,000, along with the slope, to create a point-slope form of this equation for

00:00:36.847 --> 00:00:42.219
this line, and then I transform that to be in slope-intercept form. So our final

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.383
answer is, n equals negative 200 c plus 18,000.
