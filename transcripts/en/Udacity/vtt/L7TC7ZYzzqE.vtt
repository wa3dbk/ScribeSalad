00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.230
So, back to our overall
reducing the AMAT.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.680
We've seen some techniques
to reduce the hit time.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.820
We've seen techniques to
reduce the miss rate.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.180
We've seen a technique for

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.690
reducing the miss penalty which
is to overlap multiple misses.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.100
And we will now see a technique
called multi-level caches, or

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.710
having a cache hierarchy
instead of just one cache.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.030
With this technique, a miss in the first
cache of the processor accesses,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.130
which is called now a level one cache,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.020
will just go to another
cache instead of memory.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.750
So now, the miss penalty from
our level one cache is not

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.720
equal to the memory latency.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.270
The miss penalty in level one
cache now is the hit time

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.710
of the level two cache plus when
the level two cache misses,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.440
then it's going to be level two miss
rate times the level two miss penalty.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.780
And this level two miss penalty can be
the actual memory latency but we can

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.467
have a level three cache and if we miss
there, a level four cache and so on.
