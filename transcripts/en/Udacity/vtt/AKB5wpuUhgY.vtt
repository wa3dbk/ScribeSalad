00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.570
This equation represents a hyperbola that opens to the left and to the right.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.513
Now we might not recognize the hyperbola in this form. So, let's subtract y

00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:14.329
squared from both sides of the equation. This'll move the y squared to the

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.920
left-hand side, so we'll have x squared minus y squared equals positive 9 on

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.352
the right. We have subtraction between our x squared term and our y squared

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:28.203
term, so we know this is a hyperbola. Further more, we know that this parabola

00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:33.438
opens to the left and to the right since the x squared term is positive. It's

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:37.096
the one that comes first. Now it's not so much which one comes first, but it's

00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:41.886
really the one that's positive determines the direction. Since the x squared

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:45.730
term is positive, we know it opens left and right. And just to be sure, I'll

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.280
show you this graph to tell you that these graphs are identical. The equations

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.870
represent the same hyperbola.
