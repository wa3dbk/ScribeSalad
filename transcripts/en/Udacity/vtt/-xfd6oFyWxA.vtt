Let us talk about Computational Psychometrics a little bit.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.170
Psychometrics itself is a study of human intelligence, of human aptitude,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.350
of human knowledge. Computational Psychometrics for our purposes,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.370
is the design of computational agents that can take the same kind of tests that

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.750
humans do, when they are tested for intelligence or knowledge or aptitude.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.760
Imagine that you design an AI agent that can take an intelligence test.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.360
After designing it, you might want to analyze how well does it do compared to

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.760
the humans on that test? You might also want to compare the errors it

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.100
makes with the errors that humans make. If it does as well as humans do and

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.470
if its behavior, its errors are the same as those of humans,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.270
you might conjecture then that perhaps its reasoning mirrors that of humans.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.220
In this class, we are going to be designing AI agents that can

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.790
take the Raven's Test of Intelligence. In the process, we will want to use this

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.130
agents to reflect on how humans might be addressing the same intelligence tests.
