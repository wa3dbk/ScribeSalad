00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We had a question from Bonnie Monson on classes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and what they are, and classes are part of something called

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
object-oriented programming.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's a really big topic.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You could easily spend an entire course or 2 or 3

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
on just object-oriented programming.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Steve just recommended you look at the docs.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We'll link to the docs.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
A lot of people weren't satisfied with that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There's really not any way for us to deal with

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
object-oriented programming in any kind of complete way in this course.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Basically, a class is a way to organize

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
variables, functions, and other pieces of data

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in Python or another object-oriented programming language

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
such that you can pass them around and that you have

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
different spaces of names so that you don't have

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
multiple variables with the same name conflicting with each other.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There is a lot more to it, but we don't think that we're going to have to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
deal with that that much, and you shouldn't have to know too much about it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Again, we're going to link to the docs.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If you really want to know about it, I would recommend reading them.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
They're not too bad.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They might be beyond some of you depending on what your background is,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but we're hopefully going to be offering some more material on that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in future courses, so if you'd like to know more about that,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'd recommend sticking around for that.
