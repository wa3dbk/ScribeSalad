00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.250
Underneath the division sign, we need to leave room for the x squared and x

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.356
terms, even though their coefficients are zero. So, we'll write x cubed plus

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:13.380
zero x squared, plus zero x plus 1. The x plus 1 doesn't need any changing at

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.530
all. We can just write it as is outside the division sign.
