00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
So let's say we are starting out and I'm going to do is using an example.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.450
So let's say we start up with the following Boolean formula (x₁ or not-x₂ or x₃)

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:20.490
and (not-x₁ or x₂) and ( not-x₂ or x₃) and the array we're going to transform this into a network

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.840
is we're going to do groups of vertices for each clause.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.120
So for this clause here, for this one here, and for this one here.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.000
So, this is our first group of vertices and we're going to have

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.630
one vertex for each variable in that clause.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.030
So, this vertex here is for the x₁. This vertex here is for the not-x₂. This one here is for the x₃.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.430
For this one here, we're going to do another group. This one here is for the not-x₁.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.080
This one here is for the x₂.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.910
And for that clause done here. We're going to do the same thing.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.560
So we have not-x₂ and here we have x₃.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.910
And now, we're going to draw a lot of edges.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:15.310
So from each vertex, we're going to draw edges to every vertex

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.070
in the other groups with one exception.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.380
We're not going to draw an edge if we have the same variable,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.020
but 1 is the untouched variable and the other one has a not.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.920
So x₁ and x₂, we're going to draw an edge. x₁ and x₃, we're going to do an edge..

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.750
And x₁ and not-x₂ also but we're not going to do an edge here.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.260
And it works similarly for this one here. So not-x₂, not-x₁, that's something we don't care about.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.360
That's something where we draw an edge. no-x₂ and x₂.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.050
And then we have a not. Here, we do not have a not. So we don't draw an edge.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.550
And down here, that's fine. And here we have a case where we have not-x₂ and not-x₂.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.290
That's also fine. So we'll draw an edge here.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.560
It's early if we have a not and then here we don't have one.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.229
So for x₃, we can draw an edge down here. Down here.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.440
Again, those are the same. So we do draw an edge. That's fine and we're draw here.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.690
Now let's look at those here. So we already have all the edges all to these groups.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.980
So we only need to look down here and then the graph edges here

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.400
and the same thing is going to happen here.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.230
So x₂, I'm not drawing an edge to this not-x₂ here and we're drawing an edge down here.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.830
And we've already drawn all the edges down here. So this is the network that we constructed.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.980
Now what about the size of the graph?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.970
So if the Boolean formula here has polynomial size, so we have n variables

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.180
or in this case three variables and we said that we're going to have

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.540
the total length of the Boolean formula.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.390
The polynomial and the number of variables.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.590
So, if this length here is polynomial, then the network also will have polynomial size

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.090
because we have one vertex for each of the variables that occur here,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.450
so the size really doesn't change that much.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.130
We introduced edges but you already know that the number of edges is quadratic

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.470
in the number of vertices that we have.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.790
So, the size stays polynomial which is already good for our reduction.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.920
But now I still need to show you what satisfiability has to do with clique.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.180
We're actually going to do this as a quiz. So let's say that the Boolean formula has m clauses.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.320
So in this case, m is 3 but you can consider the more general case here

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.840
and then let's say that the graph that we have constructed has a clique of size m.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.220
So one clique of size m, for example here, because m is 3 would be this here.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.500
All vertices are connected to each other. There's others that you can find actually.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.330
So, if she can't find a clique of size m in a graph that was constructed this way,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.230
does that graph contain at least one vertex from each clause group

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.680
and by clause group, I mean, the groups of vertices that we introduced

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.720
for each of the clauses from our satisfiability formula.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.970
And what I would also like you to think about is if a clique can contain

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.410
multiple vertices from one of this clause groups here.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.620
So if we could have a clique, say for example, that could contain these two vertices here

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.260
or this two here or in the more general case, if we can have a clique

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.010
that contains more than one vertex from each of these groups here.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.290
So please check those that are correct and leave the other ones blank.
