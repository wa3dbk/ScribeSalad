00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.490
The next principle we should
talk about is automation.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.180
Whenever you write a piece of
code to perform a task that

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.600
otherwise you do by hand,
that counts as automation.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.010
There are a lot of steps
of both development and

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.950
operations processes
that can be automated.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.019
One big one is deployment, setting
up a server to run an application.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.040
Once upon a time, sysadmins would
spend a lot of time setting up

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.910
physical servers individually.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.930
And when you needed to
install software upgrades,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.900
you'd log into each machine and
run the upgrade.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.880
Now smart operations people would
automate as much of this as possible,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.720
like throw together a shell script
that logs into each server and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.040
runs the upgrade.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.220
But that kind of work generally
wasn't visible outside of ops.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.360
There's something that ops did to
make their own job easier, but

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.820
it wasn't recognized as a vital
function of the organization.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.460
But today, on the other hand, you don't
have one or two physical servers for

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.570
an application.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.750
You might have dozens of server
instances on a cloud platform, or

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.220
you might have hundreds to support
a large and popular application.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.140
At that scale, you can't reasonably
manage them by hand at all.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.930
You need automation just
to get the job done.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.900
Now on the development side of things,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.400
there are also a bunch of
things that can be automated.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.120
This isn't really new with DevOps.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.160
The agile movement embraced unit
testing, acceptance testing, and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.880
continuous integration.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.760
But DevOps ties these into
the deployment process,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.700
eliminating the boundary between
developer side automation and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.734
operation side automation.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.940
After all, if we're both
working on the same service,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.750
why should we have two
incompatible views of it?

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.680
Well, we'll be talking more about
automation in lessons two and three,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.360
and you'll get some hands-on experience
with automating parts of the testing and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.220
deployment workflow.
