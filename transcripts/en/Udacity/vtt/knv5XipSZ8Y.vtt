00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's see if we can work out this function.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Looking again, countdown of n--well, whatever n is, it's going to call countdown with that variable.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's going to do some statements. It's going to repeat this how many times?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
As x is counting down by 5s, it's going to keep doing this until it gets to be 0 or less.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
How many times is that going to be?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's like whatever this x is, which is really whatever this n is,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
divided by 5 but rounded up,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because if you have something like 6, x is going to be 6.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's going to do this loop. X is going to get decremented to 1.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Come back up here--it's still greater than 0.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's going to do it again.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The only way that it wouldn't have done that if it was exactly 5.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Put 5 in, it executes it once.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Subtract 5 away form it and end up with 0.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It falls through. It doesn't repeat the loop at that point.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What we really want here is to take n divided by 5 and round it up.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This math.ceiling function does that.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It rounds a non-integer number up to the nearest integer.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's the number of times that these two statements are going to be executed.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We multiply that by 2, and then there's 3 other statements that are going to get executed--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
this print statement, this print statement, and this initialization of the y variable.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This formula will actually tell us the number of steps as a function of n that this countdown will do.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What is it? It really is roughly n divided by 5 times 2 plus a constant.

00:01:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Essentially linear in n. Here's the actual formula.
