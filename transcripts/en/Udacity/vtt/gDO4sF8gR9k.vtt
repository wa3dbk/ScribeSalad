00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In fact, I'd like you to modify this code a little bit more

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in a way that we have multiple measurements.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Instead of Z, we're going to make a measurement vector called "measurements."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're going to assume that we're going to first sense red and then green.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Can you modify the code that so it updates the probability twice

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and gives me the posterior after both of these measurements are incorporated?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In fact, can you modify it in a way

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that any sequence of measurements of any length can be processed?
