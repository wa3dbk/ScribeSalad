00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.570
But this inequality is intimiatly related to a rational function. Logically,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.890
that rational function, is just 2 x minus 3, over x minus 5, equals f of x of

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.117
course. Let's just take a second to look at this rational function on it's own

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:17.411
then. See if there are any vertical, horizontal, or slant asimtotes for this

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:22.409
function. If there are no asymptotes of one of these types, simply type the

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.319
word none in its box. Otherwise we're going to need equations of lines here.
