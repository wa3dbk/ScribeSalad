00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Once we have printed out our current information, we read a command, we're going to define

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
appropriate function input command for that and then we're going to invoke a function named debug

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with the command with the current argument and with all local variables.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We have our debug function--return a value named resume.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If resume is false, we stay in this current event--that is we don't proceed in our code,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and if resume is true, then we exit the loop, step out of our trace it function

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and then execute the next line in the program.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Let me first come up with the debugging function.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It accesses the state of the debugger by these two global variables--stepping and breakpoint.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If the command we have entered as an argument, then this should be a space between the command

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the argument and we get the argument by splitting the entire string,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
getting the second element in the resulting list, which is the argument.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Otherwise, the argument is just none.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now, we can check what the command actually is and what it should do.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
For instance, if we say s or any command that starts with s and want to step to the program,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so what we do is we set stepping to true such that in the next line the program will stop again

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and we return true such that after stepping,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
execution resumes and actually goes to the next line.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We can now add more commands--for instance, continue here which sets the stepping variable

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to false and still ask the debugger to resume.
