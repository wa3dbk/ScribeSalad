00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.144
Now you've done this already, remember? When you changed all of the pixels from

00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:07.612
an image into the negative. At the time, I gave you the loop structure to do

00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:12.906
this, and I told you not to look too closely at it. Now, we're ready to reveal

00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:16.862
this mystery. On your left we're going to start this program. We have a full

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:19.971
loop. Because we want to iterate over all of the pixels, we'll find out soon

00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:24.380
enough how many pixels there are. The structure's very similar to the structure

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.142
for working with words. Instead of getting the ith character, we get the ith

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:34.438
pixel by getting the color at position i. And we can also set it, presumably

00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:40.608
after having changed it in some way. So here's your basic loop. Get the pixel,

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:45.682
process it, and put it back. Now, how many pixels do we have? We can ask the

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:50.491
picture, and it's going to tell us the number of pixels. And that is the exact

00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:55.090
analogue to the length of a string except that you should think of the pixels

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.170
as being arranged like this. A row of pixels, another row and they all come one

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.576
after another. When we ask for them. And eventually we reach all the pixels

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:12.402
that way. I starts at zero. It goes up to the total pixel count. Is incremented

00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:17.036
at every step. We get the i pixel. And that way we get all of the pixels in the

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:22.899
image. In our particular example. We simply compute the negative of the color,

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.566
and then we can put it back. Finally, we want to load the picture, show it to

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:34.394
the user, and then start processing it. Let's run the code. Here is Eliza, all

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:40.837
positive. And here she is, sadly negative. As you've seen, it's just as easy to

00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:44.360
work with pictures as it is to work with words.
