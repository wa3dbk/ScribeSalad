00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.680
Tunnel mode is the more
commonly used operation mode.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.820
Suppose we have two end hosts, A and
B, belonging to the same company but

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.780
in two different local area
networks over the Internet.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.090
If these IPs are tunneled between the
gateways of the two local area networks,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.640
then traffic from A to B is
automatically protected by the tunnel.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.130
That is, A can send unencrypted or
unprotected packets.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.130
And before the packets leave
the local area network,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.690
the gateway adds protection and
sends the packets to the gateway

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.670
to B's network which then
unprocesses the packets.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.650
For example, decrypts the packets and
sends them to B.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.701
The gateway of A's network actually
encapsulates traffic from A to B

00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:52.836
by adding a new IP header that specifies
the gateway as the source IP and

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:56.300
B's gateway as its destination IP.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.254
To make sure that the protective packet
is delivered to B's gateway first.

00:01:01.254 --> 00:01:05.783
It also includes the IP's header
which contains information about

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:11.340
the protection provided using Or
ESP which we will discuss shortly.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.060
The original packet now becomes the data
or payload of the new IP packet.
