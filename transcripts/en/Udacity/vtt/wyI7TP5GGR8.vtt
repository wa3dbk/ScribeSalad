00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:13.351
The answer is no, there is a another way to factor x square plus 1. We can

00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:25.086
rewrite this using a middle term as x squared plus 0x plus 1. And if we try to

00:00:25.086 --> 00:00:27.564
factor this, we're looking for what two numbers a and b add equals 0, and

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:29.549
multiply it to equal 1. However, if a plus b equals 0 and that means that a is

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:31.277
equal to negative b, that means one of the most negative, and one of the most be

00:00:31.277 --> 00:00:35.301
positive. And any positive number multiply by negative number gives us the

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.794
negative number, so their product can't be 1. Now of course, the product would

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:40.744
be zero, then this equation would be true, but then their product would be 0 not

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.237
1. Either way, there is no way to factor this. This is pretty interesting.
