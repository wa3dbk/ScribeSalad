00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay--so, cool. Let's try this out in practice.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So here we are in our Editor--here's our form HTML.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're going to have to edit this to make it a little bit more complex.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I want to put in a few new lines as well

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to make it a little bit easier to read.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So I'm done editing the HTML.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I've actually only made a fairly small change

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but I put some new lines in here so we can read it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So now we've got ,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the string, Month--which is what it said before,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and our field--and I've added

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this new value parameter for (month),

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I've added another one for (day), and another one for (year).

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And we're going to pass these values in

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to our function below

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so that our form renders extra values.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Okay. So let's edit the function below

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and put this whole thing together.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We're going to edit, now, our write_form function.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're already passing in error--let's add in the other parameters.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So I'm adding the extra parameters, and they're all going to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
have defaults to (blank) month, day, and year--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
nothing crazy about that.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and let's also edit our Dictionary that we pass into the form

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to use these variables.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We've updated the dictionary; now we're passing these variables

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
into this dictionary, which gets passed into our form string.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And so, now, whenever we write the form,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
our form function--our write_form function--

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
can take extra variables to populate the form.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's make sure everything still works the way it did before--

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
before we go ahead and call this function.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Here we are in our browser; let's type in: some junk,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
submit our form, and see if everything works.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Okay. We didn't get an exception; nothing broke--

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so we're in good shape.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Let's go ahead and get these fields populated.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Here's our new write_form function, here's our POST function.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Here we've got our three variables that represent

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
what the user entered--we're getting them from the request here.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Let's edit our POST function

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to use these new variables.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now we're going to have to restructure this a little bit because

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
right now we're calling valid_month on the request parameters.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And if one of these parameters is invalid,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we're just going to get False back,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and that's not what we want--so we need to change just a little bit.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So let's restructure this.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So I got rid of our calls to valid_month, day and year--

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and user_month just equals

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
what the user actually entered in for month, day, and year.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And then I'm going to use different variables

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to test their validity, and I'll add those now.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Okay--so I separated the calling of valid_month, day, and year

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
from fetching the parameter out of the request.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And this is so we can have both variables

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that represent whether the values are valid or not,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and also variables that represent what the user actually entered--

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because we may have to reuse those.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Okay--so let's change our validity check now

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to use the proper variables.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Okay. I've changed our validity check here

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to make sure we're using month, day, and year now--

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
those variables instead of user_month, day, and year.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And now let's change our call to write_form.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And now I'm passing in these strings

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that the user originally entered

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
into our form so that when we have an error

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
we'll render the form with whatever the user typed in.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Let's give this a shot in production.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So we've got our form; let's type in: some junk.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
When we submit our form now what we should see

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
is an error message and our form field should still have our values in it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
There we go.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It doesn't even look like our form was rerendered

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
because all that appeared was our error message.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
That's pretty neat, huh?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And let's make sure that submitting the correct answer still works.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Okay--so we're going to enter in real data.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
This is going to go through our validators,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and let's submit this form: success!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So it rejected our bad form and it accepted our good form.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
That's pretty cool.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So I've entered in a normal dau and a normal year

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
but in a month, I've entered in a quote

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and some more text.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
What's going to happen when I click the Submit button?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Are we going to see an error message and our inputs will be on our form

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
--you know--our normal error behavior?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We'll see an error message, but quote messes up our HTML?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Will we cause on error on the Server side?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Or will the page just render: blank?
