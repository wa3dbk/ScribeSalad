00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.966
Another thing you guys have asked about a lot is,

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.840
is how you choose between web frameworks.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.540
Now, remember the framework is generally the key step that sits between your

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.570
program and the internet.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.290
Now, in this class we've been using the Google App engine frame work,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.320
which is basically called Web App 2, which I found really nice.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.950
This handles, basically, basic HTTP, kind of the scheduling,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.040
like the threading issues, you know, handling multiple requests at once.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.460
Parsing basic headers, basically looking for things out of the GET request or

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.860
the POST request and putting them into these, like, request objects.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.320
Turning your response object into the appropriate HTTP to send to the browser.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.910
The URL mapping and all of that stuff is really helpful.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.120
Various degrees of web framework that give you more or

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.240
less control and require you to do more or less work.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.550
The level that we've been working on in webapp2 is the level where I,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.610
I really like to be.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.620
The things that I,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.790
I really like about it are that we have direct access to GET and POST.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.706
Some frameworks kind of hide this from you, and I think it's really important

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:52.460
that you are explicit about which method you're handling a GET or a POST.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.580
If you're thinking about the web in that way,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.670
your websites will generally make more sense.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.590
You won't make the mistakes of having, or you won't as easily make mistakes as

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.870
having your, you know, your GETs modify the database and

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.209
then getting cached weird and, you know, your forms not submitting properly.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.730
Understanding webs and

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.270
web applications at the kind of method level, I think, is very, very important.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.940
We've got direct access to the request.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.490
You know, this means things like headers.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.650
Yes, there are convenience functions for setting cookies and

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.830
getting cookies, but you can also manipulate the headers directly.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.190
Sometimes you'll want to do something funky with content type or content length.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.710
Then if the web framework don't let you do that, it can be really frustrating.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.390
You can't build the site the way you want to.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.850
So I find this kind of low level stuff is really helpful.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.270
But it's not so low that you're dealing with,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.300
like, HTTP versions and host headers unless you really want to.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.620
There are kind of features that a lot of frameworks do that I

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.770
think that are non-important.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.170
This is strictly in my opinion.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.860
Things like sessions, caching, some have automatic forums, database ORM stuff.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.070
I don't like working with these because I find every time I

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.490
use something like this, it's very soon after that I need a custom behavior.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.920
I want to handle sessions differently, or I want to cache things differently, or

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.280
my forms don't fit the way the author thinks forms should work.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.250
Or, you know, the ORM can't express queries that I want to express,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.390
or won't let me cache the way I want to cache certain queries.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.530
So I find this sort of stuff is a little too high level for me and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.470
I always end up rewriting it anyway.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.907
To me, the important things are basic HTTP, having access to headers, and

00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:11.580
GET and POST.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.350
I almost never use pre-built session things, and caching, forms, and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.980
database stuff.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.060
In every experience I've had, in the long run,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.688
I end up getting frustrated and I have to rewrite something that would have just

00:02:20.688 --> 00:02:21.990
been simpler to do in the first place.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.930
I generally don't like magic.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.560
When you look at some code and it just seems too magical, like it

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.340
did all of this stuff for you and you're so far away from the request that you

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.730
don't actually know what happened, that's a terrible way to write web software.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.130
You're not going to be able to scale it properly.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.420
You're not going to know why something breaks when it inevitably does.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.380
And it's going to take you,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.990
I think ultimately it will cost you more work than just thinking through each of

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.720
these problems on your own.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.040
Sometimes, it's a good way to get started.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.580
Something I didn't discuss here are the notion of templates.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.480
Template languages come in all varieties.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.970
I am partial to one on Python called Mako.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.460
What we've been using in this class is Ginja 2, and Ginja's also been great.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.860
I think that the discipline here when you're using templates is making sure you

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.870
separate code from templates.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.704
A lot of these template systems allow you to put arbitrary code in them or

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:03.560
complicated logical structures, if and for and while.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.850
Try to keep it to the, the amount of code in templates to a minimum.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.080
You've got this whole language you know, in our case, Python.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.540
That's a very, very powerful langauge, you can do all sorts of things.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.040
Why would you use a broken subset of that in your templates?

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.920
Any complexities should be actually in your Python code and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.880
not in your template code.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.590
Didn't come up much in

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.400
this class because most of the rendering code we're using was fairly simple.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.830
It's really easy to just throw complete objects and big data structures and

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.190
unwind them and, and navigate them in your template code.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.430
And that's something that's just really difficult to maintain.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.450
I wouldn't recommend doing that.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.160
Templates are great, but use them with care.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.010
Use them for just generating your HTML.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.350
Or just generating your CSS.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.430
Or whatever you're using it for.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.000
And try to keep the code in the actual programming language.
