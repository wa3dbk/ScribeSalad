00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.346
Now, a relative maximum is a value of the function that is higher than all the

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:08.795
other values of the function that are in the neighborhood of that point. So, a

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:13.954
so-called relative maximum like a relative minimum because it's a maximum just

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:18.804
in relation to the points surrounding that point. So, as we said before, B on

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:23.688
this purple curve is a relative maximum, that's because all of the points to the

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:28.054
left of it and all the points to the right of it, in the general area of the

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:32.716
curve close to B, have values of the function that are lower than what we find

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:37.080
at B itself. So, if we relate B to parts of the graph that are further away,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.560
like points up here, we will find some areas where the function takes a higher

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.781
values than it does with B. But those aren't close by. For the points that B

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.543
really cares about that are close to it, it's right on top.
