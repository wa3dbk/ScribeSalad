00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.300
So far, we have inspected the various variables of interest in the data.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.980
We have looked at the allowed amount, charged amount and the payment amounts.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.760
Now we will ask the question of correlations.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.210
In asking if the variables are correlated,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.110
we can ask if the correlation is non-linear or if the correlation is linear.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.140
We can inspect this by looking at a scatter diagram of the variables.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.800
Let us now inspect the scatter diagram of the two variables, f1 and f2.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.500
Notice that we have plotted both the variables after scaling them.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.750
Once you're done, you should have a graph that looks very much like this.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.610
The scatter plot for these two variables are very linear.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.970
What we can conclude from that is that the paid amounts are directly

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.020
proportional to the allowed amounts.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.750
Similarly, we can look at the scatter plot of f0 and f1.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.140
In this case, although we have some correlation,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.620
it is not as linear as it is between f1 and f2.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.560
We want to have a quantitative measurement of the correlation between

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.150
two variables.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.610
We have already observed from the scatter plot of f1 and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.410
f2 that they're linearly correlated.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.500
We can calculate what is called the Pearson's correlation coefficient.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.580
Let's first define this quantity.
