So the terms genius and intellectual disability are really not fair because IQ

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.664
is not the same thing as creativity. In fact, you can have disability,

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:14.822
cognitive or intellectual disability and yet have extreme talents and this is

00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:21.607
best seen in savants. Savants are people who do in fact have Disability and yet

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:27.250
extreme and uncanny talents. Kim Peek is one of the better known examples of,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.508
of a savant. Kim Peek for instance, could read a page in eight to ten seconds

00:00:32.508 --> 00:00:39.405
that takes us three or four minutes to read. And he could remember 98% of it.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:44.950
Up to years and years later, exactly what was on that page. He also could tell

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.450
you precisely what day of the week you were born on, if you give your birthday.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.172
He could also tell you what your zip code was if you give him your address. And

00:00:55.172 --> 00:01:01.976
yet, he couldn't dress himself, and nor could he understand metaphor. So, for

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:06.440
instance, the phrase get a hold of yourself, didn't really make sense to him.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.950
So do you think that Kim Peek's IQ is a valid indicator of how smart he is?
