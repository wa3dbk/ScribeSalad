00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.550
Earlier on, we talked about how many gallons of cleaning solution Grant should

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:09.100
buy depending on how many orders he received from customers. Initially, Grant

00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:13.545
had thought that he wanted to keep ten extra gallons of cleaning solution on

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:18.409
hand at all times, but he's changed his mind a little bit. He's gotten a ton of

00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:23.294
orders, more than he was expecting. So, he's decided to adjust his surplus from

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:27.903
10 gallons to 20 gallons. What equation do we need now to describe how many

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:32.713
gallons of cleaning solution Grant should buy, depending on many orders he's

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:37.692
received? To be super clear, I've written down what each of our variables in the

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:42.784
original equation stood for. Also, the surplus of cleaning solution is the only

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:47.606
thing that Grant wants to change. He's not going to change the number of gallons

00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:49.498
that he buys per expected order.
