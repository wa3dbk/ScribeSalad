00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.980
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that we've reminded ourselves of what a square root sign actually means,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.948
what do you think the next step in moving towards solving our equation should

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:12.182
be? Remember, we want to get x by itself on one side of the equation eventually.

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:16.059
So should we start off by multiplying both sides by the quantity 2x plus 4?

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.546
Should we multiply both sides by the square root of 2x plus 4? Should we square

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:25.704
both sides, or should we multiply both sides by 2? Clearly these are all steps

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:30.272
that we could take and would be legal in the context of solving equations. But

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:34.461
which one will actually move us as close to our answer as we can get in one

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:34.835
step?
