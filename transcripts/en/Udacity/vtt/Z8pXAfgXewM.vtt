Now, we've already talked about x as the independent variable, and y as the

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.543
dependent variable, in equations that are written like this. So, we know we can

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:12.764
think about the relationship between x and y, in terms of y depending on x or,

00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:17.112
alternatively, x being the cause and y being its effect. But we can also think

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:21.351
about this in terms of input and output. In the soda machine example we looked

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:25.443
at earlier, the input was the amount of money that Athena put in this sort of

00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:29.800
machine, and the output was the number of soda's that came out of the machine.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.293
So, for an equation like this, which quantity do you think represents the input,

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:37.069
and which one do you think represents the output?
