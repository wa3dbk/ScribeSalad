00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.192
So we use the factored form of our polynomial function to find its zeros. And

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:09.596
interestingly enough both of these zeros were ratios. But where did these

00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:14.310
ratios come from? They're in a very specific form. I'll give you two options.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.763
Are each of these zeros a ratio of A factor of negative 5 over a factor of 6 or

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:24.951
a factor of 6 over a factor of negative 5. Remember that 6 and negative 5 here

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:28.219
are coming straight from our original function.
