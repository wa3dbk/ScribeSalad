00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here I have a grammar that we've seen before, but I've abbreviated it still further.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Instead of identifier, I've just written "id," and instead of number, I've just written num.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This sort of abbreviation is all too common in computer science.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Programmers can't help it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Unfortunately, it's a bit of a vice, because while it's easy for me to see what's going on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it can be hard for someone reading it later--myself included--to tell what my variable names mean.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Whenever possible, you should take the time to make your variable names as descriptive as possible.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Add lots of comments.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It turns out that 90% of software is maintenance.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Just like a popular book is read many more times than it's written,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
a program is read or maintained or executed many more times than it's written.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's worth taking the time to do it right the first time.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That said, clearly I'm not, so this must be one of those

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
do what I say and not what I do back professor sorts of maneuvers.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Regardless, back on track. Here's the grammar.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Statement goes to identifier equals expression,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and expression is the same sort of arithmetic we've seen before.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're not going to consider this particular sentence "yggdrasil equals 6 minus 5.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I've written out a parse tree--a bit squashed at the bottom but still recognizable--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for this phrase "yggdrasil equals 6 minus 5,"

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but I've forgotten two labels. It's quiz time. Fill in the blanks.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What would have to go in each of these blanks in order to this parse tree

00:01:28.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to match this input utterance according to this grammar?
