00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the answer is no. This is a case of what we call reverse causation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You can argue that the size of the fire causes the number of firefighters that is being destroyed,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and that's because the bigger the fire the more firefighters the fire department will send.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now our graph, which shows the correlation between these two

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
variables is oblivious to the direction of this arc.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You could conclude size causes this and fire than the firefighters.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You could conclude the number of firefighters causes this size.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In both cases you could use exact the same data.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But when I put it this way, it's pretty obvious that the right answer should be the size of the fire

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
causes the number of firefighters to grow up and it's not from the data itself.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's because we know there's something about fire and firefighters.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's impossible to deduce from this data that it causes a relationship.

00:00:57.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It could be just coincidental or that cause a relationship could go either way.
