00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.962
Informatics for Integrating Biology and
the Bedside, or i2b2 for short,

00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:11.860
is an NIH-funded effort based at
Partners HealthCare System in Boston.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.140
Its mission is to enable clinical
investigators to conduct research

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.160
using state of the art genomics and
biomedical informatics.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.870
As compared to hQuery,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.460
it's a far more sophisticated system to
support complex research environments.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.400
But it provides an easily
understood database schema

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.750
that can be used to create a data
warehouse, where clinical abstracts from

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
an enterprise EHR can be stored for
future analysis.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.610
This is important because the database
scheme of commercial enterprise EHRs can

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.234
be dauntingly complex,
is usually proprietary, and

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:54.890
it is not necessarily designed
well to support ad hoc queries.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.710
i2b2 implementations are comprised
of cells that communicate with each

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.600
other via web services and together,
are called a hive, as shown here.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.770
And no, Marla,
it doesn't contain any honey.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.520
The role of most of these cells or

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.140
web services should be
clear from their names.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.900
Importantly, custom cells
can be added to the hive.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.180
There's an organized i2b2 users
group to share information and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.550
applications and to create the potential
for translational research

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.420
through collaboration in federated
queries across institutions.
