00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.070
So now that I've got the pen back,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.190
we're going to wrap this up by talking
about something we promised to talk

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.610
about at the end of the last class,
which is Mechanism Design.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.240
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.470
&gt;&gt; Right, this seems reasonable right?

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.040
&gt;&gt; It's like mechanical engineering.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.836
&gt;&gt; It is not like mechanical engineering
except in a very abstract and

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:17.798
analogy sense.

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:18.420
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.990
what mechanism design is it's kind of
the art the science and engineering,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.490
dare I say it, of creating games to
elicit certain kind of behavior.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.045
So, so far what we've been talking
about with our solution concepts and

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:34.422
all the things we be doing in game
theory one, two, and three so far,

00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:37.181
is we've talked about what
happens when we play games.

00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:41.100
And at least stepping back a little
bit what we get when we play games is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.530
we get certain predictable behaviors and
those behaviors are natural.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.404
They're natural equilibria or
maybe they're correlated equilibria or

00:00:49.404 --> 00:00:52.277
maybe they're cocoa whatever
you call equilibria and

00:00:52.277 --> 00:00:54.408
other things we haven't talked about.

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.786
But here what we want to do in Mechanism
Design is we want to make a game so

00:00:58.786 --> 00:00:59.974
just play a game but

00:00:59.974 --> 00:01:04.280
again with the end goal of getting
some specific behaviors, okay?

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.019
Does it make sense?

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.970
&gt;&gt; It feels kind of like inverse
reinforcement learning in that we're

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.440
going from the behavior that we want
to a game that would make that behavior

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.040
whereas in regular game theory we
go from the game to the behavior.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.389
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that if I going to get
so much, I will draw the arrow that way.

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.102
So here, we have a behavior we want and

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:24.870
we're going to come up with a game that
would actually lead to that behavior.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.520
I like that.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.610
And then, once we've made a game, what
will happen is we'll get people to play

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.930
that game, and then that will
generate the right behavior.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.590
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.617
&gt;&gt; Okay cool, so
it's like a sort of cycle of life thing.

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:38.165
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah it's not
a cycle though but sure.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:38.963
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but

00:01:38.963 --> 00:01:40.608
I don't think that arrow means anything.

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:43.020
&gt;&gt; It means it's the identity function.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.880
&gt;&gt; Lead to behaviors which
lead to a game, sure.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.620
&gt;&gt; So there are lots of ways we could
talk about this but I think for

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.770
the purpose of this class, I think
the most interesting way to kind of get

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.030
across mechanisms design is
just to give a few examples.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.450
So I'm going to give two, or
maybe three examples, and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.050
sort of work through what is sort of
easy and hard about mechanism design.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.737
I try to give you a feel for
why this is actually important and how,

00:02:05.737 --> 00:02:09.762
by making little sort of specific
decisions you can have a huge impact on

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.591
the behavior that people have.

00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:15.374
And in fact, you could argue that
everything that happens in politics,

00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:18.480
the laws that we make,
they're all about mechanisms.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.780
They're all about figuring out
how to influence behavior.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.290
They're all about incentivizing
peculiar behavior.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.500
So the big sample that people talk
about every four years when there's

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.960
a presidential election and
worry about, you know,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.990
the budget is one of the biggest
sort of mechanism design things

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.180
implemented in the last several hundred
years, which is the mortgage deduction.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.070
So, if you buy a house and you take on a
mortgage, you get a huge deduction, and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.130
why is that a good thing?

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.770
Well because it makes
buying house cheaper,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.920
is what actually encourages
you to buy a house.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.790
And we think that's a good idea for
a bunch of reasons but

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.790
it doesn't even really matter
why we think it's a good idea.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.580
We have actually constructed something
to encourage people to buy houses.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.550
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.690
let's see if we can kind
of do this in the small and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.160
kind of think about how you might go
about thinking about how you would

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.440
generate certain behavior in people.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440
&gt;&gt; Okay, sure.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.940
&gt;&gt; Good.
