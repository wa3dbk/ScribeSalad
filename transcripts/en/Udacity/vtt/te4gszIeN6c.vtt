00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.390
If we look at the coordinates of these three points, you'll see that they all

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:09.300
have an x value of 0, and their y values are 100, 150, and 200. This corresponds

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:14.110
to these final constant terms added on to the ends of our equations. So, those

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:18.710
are the three terms that you should have selected. This constant at the end of

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:24.014
each equation tells us where the line will intersect to the y-axis This is

00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:27.705
called the y-intercept.
