00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Male] The next 2 questions ask about Python programming.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For question 2, your goal is to write some Python code

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that prints out the number of hours in 7 weeks.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And you should do this by using Python to actually compute that value

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and print out the result.
