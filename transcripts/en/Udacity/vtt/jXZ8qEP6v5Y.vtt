JavaScript is a remarkably powerful language for manipulating the DOM.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.770
However, with great power comes great confusing syntax?

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.290
Yeah.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.970
It can be tricky to add elements to the DOM with plain old JavaScript

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.470
because you first have to create a DOM node, add data to it, find a parent for

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.710
it, and then finally add that node as a child to that parent.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.170
And each step happens pretty much independently.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.700
With jQuery, you can create new DOM nodes and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.940
simultaneously add them to the document with one simple method.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.470
I want you to experiment with four different methods for creating and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.905
adding new DOM nodes.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.347
.append(), .prepend(), .insertBefore(), and

00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:45.590
.insertAfter() give you four different places to add new DOM elements.
