00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.670
Now let's see here, 10 raised to the 3rd power, that's 10x10x10. That's 1,000.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.274
The square root of 4, well 2 times 2 is 4, so that's 2. The absolute value of 3

00:00:10.274 --> 00:00:15.520
minus 5, that's the absolute value of minus 2. Absolute value takes away the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.439
minus sign, and that's 2. Intuitively, what it means it's the magnitude of the

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.195
distance to go from 3 to 5. So you have to go two steps, you use the absolute

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:29.873
value, so that the direction doesn't matter. The absolute value of 5 minus 3 is

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:33.926
the same as the absolute value of 3 minus 5. It's just the distance between

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:36.973
these two values. Now, I've tossed in a couple of others just to see if you can

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:42.870
guess these. Min and max are the smaller and the larger of these arguments

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.954
here. So the miniumn of 300 and 255 is the smaller one, 255. The larger one of

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:54.118
zero and minus 1. Well, zero is pretty small, but it is larger than minus 2 so

00:00:54.118 --> 00:00:58.128
that's zero. And our next image processing exercise will put min and max to

00:00:58.128 --> 00:00:59.360
good use.
