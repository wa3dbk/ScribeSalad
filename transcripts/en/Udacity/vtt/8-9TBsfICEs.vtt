You might be wondering what perpendicular means, well it means that the lines

00:00:03.685 --> 00:00:08.758
cross at a right angle. We have seen this before with complimentary angles.

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:13.062
They formed a 90 degree angle together. With complimentary angles we had two

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:17.485
angles that added up to 90 degrees. And in this case we have two lines that

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:22.360
create four 90 degree angles. That's what it means to have perpendicular lines.
