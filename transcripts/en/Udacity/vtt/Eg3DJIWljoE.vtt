00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.270
So you might ask, how did I get this list of

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.030
files that I used to my manifest? I could just list

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.150
every file coming from a directory listing from my server. But

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.400
I don't want to grab things like Python files. So, the easiest

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.670
thing to do is to get files that you know you're

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.700
going to need, like the images I knew were referenced. And

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.330
the JavaScript files. And then walk through one at a time

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.630
and see what happens when you try to run the app

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.290
from the cache. Let's try this now. Let's take

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.240
a couple of these files out and see what happens.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.010
Let's save the manifest file, and go back and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.750
reload. Now remember, even though we downloaded a new cache

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.540
here, what we're looking at over here is not

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.230
that uploaded content. We need to refresh one more time.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.430
And now you'll notice that when I try to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.680
get this file from my application, it just fails. Now,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.200
if I had put in my manifest file under the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.630
network section, star, that would mean anything could come from

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.500
the network. I find it's a useful trick to not

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.450
use network Star because then you can see what's failing.
