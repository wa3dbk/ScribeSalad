00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So next kind of coverage I want to talk about is boundary value coverage. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Boundary value coverage unlike some of the other coverage measures to be looked out    

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
doesn't have any specially take technical definition.   

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Could be use it to me in different things. We're going to look at in a broad sense. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Wihat boundary value coverage basically says is when a program depends on some numerical range  

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and when the program has different behaviors based on numbers within that range   

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
then we should test numbers close to the boundary.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So let's take the example where we're writing a program to determine

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
whether somebody who lives in the USA is permitted to drink alcohol. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So we want is the 21 years of age or more is fine for them to drink alcohol 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and if they are less than 21 that is to say 20 or less then it is not legal for them to drink alcohol.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We just want to get the boundary value coverage on this program, we want to include the ages of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
20 and 21 in our test input and possibly also to 19 and 22 simply close enough to the boundary values  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that there maybe interesting behaviors looking good as well.  

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The insight here is that one of the most prominent kinds of errors that we made while

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
creating software is off by one error. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Off by one error can almost always be triggered by a value with

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the boundary and so that's what we're trying to do here.   

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What I've done here is frame the boundary value coverage as a function of only one variable  

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and also I've framed it in terms of the program specification not in terms of the implementation. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So let's look at those two issue and term. So let's consider a program with two inputs.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's assume for the sake of arguments that these inputs are treated independently   

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
by the software that we are running.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So the first input is going to be the age of your car and where insurance company here  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and we're going to decline to insure cars more than 20 years old.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The other parameter is the age of the driver and here we're going to decline

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to insure drivers who are less than 18 years old.  

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If the software treats this values independently will probably okay testing values around 18

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
independently of the age of the car and testing car ages around

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
20 years old independently of the age of the driver. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now on the other hand, if we had specific knowledge of our implementation 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
consider these variables together then we probably also need to test this combinations of inputs   

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
put in the other boundaries and you could see the problem here is that of course  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
as the number of inputs of the program goes up the number of test cases

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
can grow very large because we have to consider the interaction between all 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
possible combinations of variables that are dependent.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
On the other hand, if our variables are independent then we can test this separately.  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So that was briefly to visit the issue of whether we are doing boundary value coverage   

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
with respect to the requirements of this specification purpose of software or whether we are doing it   

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
with respect to the implementation. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Let's go and revisit the program we have a little bit earlier where I inserted a bug into our stats function   

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
which causes it to misbehave for some inputs and not for others. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So if you recall, we have the function here stats which computes the minimum, the maximum,    

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
median, and the mode of the list of numbers and the problem I post you in a quiz was

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to break this function in such a way that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
a collection of test cases getting good coverage on it wouldn't discover the bug. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And so the way I accomplished this was by taking the absolute value of the inputs  

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and so here is a bug, what we're going to do is it's only going to be discoverable when

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
we pass numbers into the function which contain negative values. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So if we think about what it takes to get boundary value coverage on a function like this 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and now we're talking about rounded boundary value coverage considering the implementation  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
not just the specification what will happen is a function like absolute value 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
would change its behavior around zero and so what we need to do get boundary value coverage  

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of the absolute value function is call it with a negative argument and a positive argument.  

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So to get good boundary value coverage on this function, we would have been forced to call it 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
with a list containing at least one negative number and we most likely

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
in that case would have discover the bug.    

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Let's look at this function in its broader context. We have a lot of code here.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
For example, i is less than mean, i is greater than max.  

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We have a lot of different operators in here but I'll have different behaviors around certain boundaries     

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and so to get good boundary value coverage on this function over all

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
would be probably extremely difficult.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I don't know a good tools automating this on Python and there are techniques 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
such as mutation testing that can automate boundary value coverage

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
at least in some forms in general.
