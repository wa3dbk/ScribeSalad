00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.153
If you said 9, excellent work. I've copied this part of the fraction over here.

00:00:05.153 --> 00:00:09.429
Working with bases of 10, I can use my exponent rules to figure out what the

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.925
power should be. Here are multiplying bases, so we add the exponents. 5 plus

00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:18.432
negative 3 equals 2, and negative 4 plus negative 3 equals negative 7. Next I

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:22.816
can subtract my exponent since I'm doing division of the bases. So 10 to the 2

00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:26.973
minus negative 7, or 10 to the 9th. This also makes sense because we know

00:00:26.973 --> 00:00:31.433
negative exponents wind up in the opposite position. So 10 to the negative 7th

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:35.811
would wind up being 10 to the positive 7th in the numerator. 10 to the 2nd and

00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:37.846
10 to the 7th would be 10 to the 9th.
