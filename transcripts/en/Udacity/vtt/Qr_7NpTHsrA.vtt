[Wes:] Welcome to Programming Languages. I'm Wes Weimer.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Together we're going to learn the theory and practice of programming languages,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
culminating in the construction of a web browser.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Our web browser will accept as input HTML and JavaScript, the primary languages of the web,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and use that to produce an image of the web page.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You may already be familiar with HTML, which describes the basics of web pages.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We'll certainly go over it in this course later on, but you may be a less familiar with JavaScript,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which allows one to describe computations that take place on web pages.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This gives us a lot of power and also a lot of flashy graphics.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's see some examples.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This particular webpage, chosen more or less at random,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
uses JavaScript to animate these tabs for its title bar at the top.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is a second example of a webpage that uses JavaScript,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
both here at the top for this sort of floating tool tip,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but also down here at the bottom to animate the differences between these textual boxes.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If we look at the source for one of these webpages,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we can see that it contains both HTML and JavaScript right from the start.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let me give you a brief overview, in pictures more or less,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
of how this course and the overarching project will go.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We start with the source to a webpage, which is in HTML and JavaScript.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Our next main step is to break that source into important words,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
just like we could break and English sentence into important words.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Then we'll understand the structure of the words that we found.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
For example, focusing on this part down here, it may be easier to understand 1 plus 2 plus 3

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
as a tree, showing all of the computations.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Then finally we'll figure out the meaning of that structure.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
For example, in this case maybe all of that adds up to 6,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and that's what we'll display in our resulting webpage.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Building a web browser will be a lot of fun, but the overall goal of this course is not

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
actually to build a production quality browser,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but instead to use the goal of building a browser as a way

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of structuring our exploration of computer science.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.738
Let's get started right here in step 1.
