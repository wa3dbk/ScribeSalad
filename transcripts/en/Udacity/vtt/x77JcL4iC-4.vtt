00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.160
So again now,
let's look at the whole approach again.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.020
And the same steps but
different details.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.090
Compute the Gaussian derivatives at
each pixel, for each and every image,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.350
that's what we want to do.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.630
Second thing we want to do is
compute the second moment matrix

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.540
in a Gaussian window around each pixel.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.600
Again, find a pixel and going through
this whole image, find a small region

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.590
and compute the second moment matrix,
because now we have the derivatives.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.630
We know how to do this.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.590
And again we want to compute
this within a window.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.360
Then using that, remember how we can
actually take R, or compute R from M,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.610
by looking at it's trace and
it's determinant, we can compute R.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.530
We want to do a little
bit of thresholding on R,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.250
because we don't want to just completely
live off the details that we had.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.260
Remember we showed you that
with the example image two.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.380
The bright white spots
will convert into small,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.500
white dots which were hard to see.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.370
Then finally find a local
maxima of the response function

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.360
by using a non-maximum suppression.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.900
And that basically now
starts giving us features.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.760
Now we have found
features in two images,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.810
which we now can be using to
match between those two images.
