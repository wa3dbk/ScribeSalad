00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.750
So, you might have noticed that
computers that are on the same network,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.800
like an individual home or business or

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.880
school, usually have IP addresses
that are similar to each other.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.860
To be more specific about it,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.370
all of the addresses on a specific
network block share a particular prefix.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.970
They all start the same and only differ
after some particular bit position.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.010
And computers that are on
the same network block,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.280
can communicate with each other
without going through a router.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.030
But not all networks are the same size.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.020
So when we talk about a particular
network, we have to talk not only

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.555
about its network prefix but
the length of that prefix.

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:41.145
A network with a longer
prefix has less of the 32-bit

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:45.595
address left over to distinguish
particular hosts, and a network with

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:49.685
a shorter prefix has more addresses for
hosts, so it's a larger network.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:52.345
The network prefix length is
something that has to be chosen when

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:56.215
the network is set up, and it's usually
configured by whatever process assigns

00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:57.405
addresses to the computers.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.200
For instance, if you have
a network with a 24-bit prefix,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.505
that means there's eight bits left
over for the host part of addresses,

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:09.345
we would conventionally
write this as /24.

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:15.551
For instance 198.51.100.0/24
network block.

00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:20.480
But if the network prefix is shorter,
say 22-bits, then there will be 10-bits

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.190
left over for host addressing,
this would be a /22 network.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.590
And you can't tell how long the prefix
is just by looking at the addresses.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.700
For these addresses, either a 22 or
24 network would be a possibility.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.432
So how many hosts can fit
on one of these networks?

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:43.170
Well 10-bits of host address means
two to the tenth power addresses,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
which would be a 1024, except that
the top and the bottom addresses of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.390
a network block are reserved and
the first address is usually the router.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.360
So 1021 addresses are available for
hosts.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.770
Similarly in a /24 network,
there would be 256 addresses but

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.700
minus those three, they're usually about
253 addresses that remain for hosts.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.580
And why does this matter?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.950
Sometimes misconfiguration can cause
some pretty weird problems on a server

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.390
network especially.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.580
Things like one machine thinks that it
can talk to another machine directly,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.070
but the other thinks that it has
to talk back through a router.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.550
And that can cause very strange
communications problems.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.600
Getting a good grasp of how this stuff
works can save you a lot of trouble if

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.970
you're ever setting up a server network.
