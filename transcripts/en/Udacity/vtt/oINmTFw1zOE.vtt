00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.722
Let's look at the solution for our control dependence

00:00:02.722 --> 00:00:05.720
quiz in a pipeline. We know how many instructions

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.598
are taken branches. We don't really care that it's

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:10.890
a ten stage pipeline. What we care about is that

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.190
the branches are resolved in the sixth stage and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.590
that everything else works smoothly. So the actual CPI will

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.730
be one per instruction. This happens for branches and

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.730
all the other instructions. Plus for every taken branch, and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.490
that happens 25% of the instructions, we have

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.950
a penalty of five cycles. Why? Because when

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.840
we resolve the branch in the sixth stage.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.860
They have already been five stages worth of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.250
instructions. That we fetched from the wrong place

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.064
and we have to throw them away. So

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:47.759
following a branch like this there will be

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.916
five cycles in which we don't finish anything,

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:53.534
so we spend one cycle per instruction and

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:57.540
for 25% of instructions. We spend additional five

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.000
cycles for that instruction. Basically there are five

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720
empty cycles after it. If you multiply this

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.580
out you get 2.25. As you can see, this CPI is very far from the ideal. Our

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.250
processor is less than half as fast as it would be without the taken branches.
