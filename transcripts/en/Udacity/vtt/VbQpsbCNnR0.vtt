00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This question asks why do most signing schemes use SIGN(m) = m || Ekr(H(m))

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
instead of the SIGN(m) = Ekr(m || nonce)?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The options are because hashing m provides more security,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to improve efficiency, to make it so that it is not necessary to perform

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
asymmetric decryption to validate a certificate,

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or to provide resistance to small message-space attacks.
