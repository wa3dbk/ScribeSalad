00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.907
Now that we have factored each part of our fraction, we can remove the common

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:07.850
factors or simplify them since they equal one. For example, we know that this

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.090
quantity that X minus four divided by the quantity X minus four would equal one.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.135
This would leave us with three times one which is three and five times one which

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:23.186
is five, or three 5th. We know we can do this because X really represents a

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:28.022
number, so if X were five we would be left with three times one and five times

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:32.642
one, which is 3 5th. But x doesn't have to be 5, it could be any number. If we

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:39.368
let x equal 6 then we plug in 6 for x and we get 3 time 6 minus 4 divided by 5

00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:44.682
times 6 minus 4. This is really the same as 3 times 2 divided by 5 times 2. The

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:49.450
twos are factors that reduce to 1, so we really have 3 fifths. It wouldn't

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.758
matter what the value of x was. The quantity x minus 4 divided by the quantity x

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:56.974
minus 4 would always equal 1.
