Thanks Lauren. As we cans see, we are constantly being bombarded with stimuli

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:08.250
throughout our day. Let's look at a typical mundane example of getting on a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.196
train and going up to campus. All the different sights, sounds, smells and even

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:18.726
tactile stimuli. Thousands and thousands of sensations. How do we know what to

00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:22.977
pay attention to? In Bentley's model, he says we have what's called a central

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:27.784
executive. And a central executive helps us to focus on a particular stimulus,

00:00:27.784 --> 00:00:32.944
and different aspects of that stimulus. So the central executive allows us to

00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:37.850
pay attention. Now there are three storage systems that aid in this process.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.920
And we're going to head back to Lauren to see what those are.
