00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.200
So two coins again, C1, C2. And let's say each coin has its own probability

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.920
of coming up heads. For the first coin, we're going to call it P1, and for the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.720
second, P2. And for reasons that should be clear later, we write it as a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.840
conditional. So that means, if the coin you're

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.852
flipping is C1, then the probability of heads

00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:26.710
equals P1. If the coin we're flipping is C2,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.330
then the probability of heads will be P2. Now,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.690
this alludes to the fact that I really want

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.020
you to pick a coin here. You're going to pick

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.430
one coin, and the probability of you pick coin one, C1, is

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.640
P0. And logically, it follows the probability of picking coin two, the other

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.950
coin, is 1 minus P0. And I'm interested in the probability that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.620
heads come up under the scenario where you first pick a coin at random and then

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.788
flip the coin. And in this exercise, I give you some very concrete numbers. P0

00:00:58.788 --> 00:01:05.248
is 0.3, P1 is 0.5, and P2 is 0.9.
