00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.260
So recall, in the previous, lesson, we talked about using a digital image as

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.560
a function, or representing a digital image as a function.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.380
Now what want to try to do is, I want to try to, bring in the concept of how we

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.560
can use that, for simple forms of image processing.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.880
Recall in the last lecture,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.232
we talked about that an image is basically a function.

00:00:21.232 --> 00:00:24.681
Which is represented by various ways of scanning through it and x and

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:27.525
y and also looking at the intensity values which would be

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:30.590
basically the height map of an image like this.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.640
Using this we basically constructed and stated that now we can actually create

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.380
a simple grid, like this, to be able to represent an image, and now we would be

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.460
able to pick up the values from each and every element of this matrix.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.620
So, just to review this, what we're trying to do,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.520
is basically we're interested in extracting discrete values of an image.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.800
So what we want to do is sample the whole image,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.060
in the two dimensions, in this case this matrix here.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.240
And look for the values off of this matrix to be

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.150
able to do any kinds of computational processes on.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.090
Of course this is approximation because it's quantizing each thing into

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.640
a districtized sample and what we basically now have integer values which we

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.950
will be then looking for to be able to extract the kinds of values from each

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.660
image, which will then be using in different computations
