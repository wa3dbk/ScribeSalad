00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.380
Now that we know how caches find
data when we are looking for it.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.140
Let's talk about what happens when we
need to replace something from the cache

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.340
to make room for new data,
because we have a miss.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.600
So the situation,
when we need replacement,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.440
is the set where the data
needs to go is full.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.230
We have a miss, so

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.220
we need somewhere to put the new
block that we are bringing in.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.240
And we need to put it in that set.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.770
And the question for cache replacement

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.270
is which of the blocks in the set do we
kick out to make room for the new one?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.240
Possible replacement policies are,
random.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.020
Just pick a block randomly from
those that are in the set.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.950
FIFO, which kicks out the block
that has been there the longest.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.000
So in FIFO,
let's say we have two blocks.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.210
We bring in A, then we bring B.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.880
When we want to bring in C,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.100
we're going to kick out A because
it's been there the longest.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.050
Then we're going to kick out
B to bring D, and so on.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.390
The next policy is LRU or
Least Recently Used.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.990
We want to kick out the block that
has not been used the longest.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.130
So we definitely don't want to kick
out the block that is the most

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.600
recently used.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.700
And then the next most recently,
and so on.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.910
So pretty much we track which
block has been used more recently.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.500
And when we need to replace something,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.630
we choose the block that we
haven't used for the longest time.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.630
It turns out that LRU is
a really good policy.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.610
So, there are several policies that are
trying to approximate it because this is

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.060
not easy to do.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.940
One such policy, for example,
is NMRU or Not Most Recently Used,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.990
which tracks just which block has
been used the most recently, and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.140
then picks randomly among
the remaining blocks.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.720
So pretty much,
don't pick the block that was just used.
