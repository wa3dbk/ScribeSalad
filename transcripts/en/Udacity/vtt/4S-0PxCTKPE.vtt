00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.220
As we said at the outside
of this course,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.300
one of the promises of the adoption
of digital records by providers and

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.210
patients would be the availability of
huge quantities of new data from which

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.430
analysis could yield insights into how
to diagnose and treat patients better.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.750
And even how to improve our
system of care delivery.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.070
You've now seen early
examples of each of these.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.960
There are still problems
with the data itself.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.750
It is often noisy,
inconsistent, or even wrong.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.070
Some patients may have
a rich data set for

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.700
a particular clinical concept,
while others may have no data at all.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.730
The interoperability problems we've
stressed throughout the course

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.460
are still an impediment.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.530
Finally, as we discussed with
Don Detmer, we may have gone too far

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.315
with patient privacy and
made it too hard to obtain the data

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:55.095
that could make a valuable contribution
to health and healthcare delivery.

00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:56.945
The solutions are ahead of us.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:01.005
And it will continue to assure that
health informatics will be an exciting

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.005
and dynamic field for years to come.
