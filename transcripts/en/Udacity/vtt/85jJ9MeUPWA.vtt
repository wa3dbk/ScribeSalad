00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.793
As we said before, the reason we need to restrict what x is allowed to equal is

00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:09.850
because certain values of x aren't going to make sense in our situation. So the

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.355
domain here is the set of values that are possible inputs of a of x. So the

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:18.998
first choice is correct. We can also think of this, however, as the set of

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:24.312
possible values of the independent variable. Since the independent variable and

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:25.908
input are the same thing.
