00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.132
This is a difference of two cubes, and the first term, the positive term, is in

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:10.467
the slot where y cubed initially was. So that means that x is used here in place

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:15.456
of y. Instead of z cubed, we have 8. So that means that 8 is equal to z cubed.

00:00:15.456 --> 00:00:20.382
If we take the cube root of both sides of this equation, we get 2 on the left

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:23.550
side and z on the right side. So z must equal 2.
