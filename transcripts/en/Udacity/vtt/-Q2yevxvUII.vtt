00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.955
You'll need to use an Object3D to let you rotate after translation. Here's my

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:09.137
solution for the minuteHand. The cube is translated to the correct pivot point

00:00:09.137 --> 00:00:13.186
by the position. That does't change. A minuteHand is then added and then rotated

00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:17.292
into place. This new object is then added to the scene. It's this minuteHand

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:22.198
object that undergoes that rotation gives us what we want. Similar code is added

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:23.423
for the hour hand.
