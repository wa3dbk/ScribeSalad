The basic definition of an Entity Class is actually pretty bare bones. As we

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:07.208
talked about in the quiz, all entities need a position variable to reference

00:00:07.208 --> 00:00:11.000
where it exists in the world. This is going to be used in the future for things

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.388
like collision and rendering of our visibility. We'll also need to know the

00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:17.623
size of this entity and there's a couple reasons for this. Number one it's

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:20.683
important to know the size of the bitmap that this entity represents, 32

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:24.964
pixels, 64 pixels. But it's also important to know the size for physics

00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:28.881
calculations. Some objects are bigger than others. And keeping that data around

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:32.409
is going to be important for us later on. And finally, in our bare bones Entity

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.242
Class, we actually define an update function. This update function will be

00:00:36.242 --> 00:00:40.364
called by a larger game manager class, about every frame. Allowing any given

00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:44.089
override-ed entity to have a time slice in order to do execution.
