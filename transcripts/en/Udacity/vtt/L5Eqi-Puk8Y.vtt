00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is a very fundamental concept in statistics.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It applies to coin flips and many of the other examples we discussed before.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A candidate in election might have a true chance that any given voter votes for him.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's call this chance P, the same as the coin flip, and of course if P larger than 0.5 in a 2% run off

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that person will not initially win in most cases, not always, but as a statistician

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we can't assess the two chances, so what we do is to form a sample.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In coin flipping, we flip n coins. In elections, we ask n randomly chosen people.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
As we know, this gives us an estimated mean.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It gives us also a variance and therefore, standard deviation.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What's new now is the confidence interval, and the confidence interval is not the same as the variance.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In fact, drop the consideration of a variance.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What this says is based on the outcome, we believe for the parameter µ.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This is the best guess we can get, which is usually maximum value estimate,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but we are not quite certain, so you're going to asses a wider range,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in which we believe with high probability that whatever the outcome will be

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that the outcome will be high probability within this range.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Very often this range is defined as 95% chance that the final outcome falls into this range.

00:01:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That will take some work to compute. So let's dive in.
