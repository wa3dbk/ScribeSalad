We want to multiply by root 5 divided by root 5. Now, that's great thinking if

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:07.700
you figured it out. We want to multiply by a form of 1 so we don't change the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.185
value of this fraction. We do this because root 5 times root 5 equals root 25.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:17.444
Now, we can take the square root of our denominator, which equals 5. For the

00:00:17.444 --> 00:00:21.522
numerator, we'll have root 2 times root 5, which equals root 10. And that,

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:25.990
we'll just leave as root 10. This means that root 2 divided by root 5 is really

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.828
equal to root 10 divided by 5. Now, if you're in disbelief, I would plug this

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:33.888
into a calculator, and this into a calculator, and see if you get the same

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:37.603
result. I think this is pretty cool.
