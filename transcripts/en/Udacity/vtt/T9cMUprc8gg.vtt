In the last question in the last homework of the

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:07.929
course, we were asked to just define a web page

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:10.481
that uses some HTML and JavaScript. So if you

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:13.805
ran it, you got this default, this comes in a

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.613
placeholder text that we gave you and we invite

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:18.950
you to use some creativity and have fun with your

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.781
brother. Someone who knew just that. So I

00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:25.296
wasn’t very creative. I adapted the code

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:27.668
from a website you may have heard of called

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:31.345
searchwithpeter.info to match the context of our

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:33.048
web browser and also to add a bit of JavaScript

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:35.764
that will work in a JavaScript interpreter. And the

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:39.723
result of that, I used a header, some paragraph

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:44.158
tags, a link, an image, I used strong to make that

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:47.073
bigger and this was generated by JavaScript

00:00:47.073 --> 00:00:50.977
execution, which isn’t very complicated. Udacity

00:00:50.977 --> 00:00:53.697
equals true if Udacity write it out and some

00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:55.522
of the P tags as we are going to interpret

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.867
it which is what we did in question two.
