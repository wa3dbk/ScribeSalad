00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.579
You just worked with Sarah on a few questions on arithmetic operations. But I

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:08.178
want to talk about the somewhat trickier aspect on how to do division with

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:12.832
integers. Let's say I have a piggy bank full of pennies, and then I want to

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:18.114
know how many dollars do I have. In Java, I can computer that with a division

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:23.359
operation, and there's a bit of a catch. When both operands on the left and on

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.769
the right hand side of the division slash our integers, then the quotient is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:35.533
formed, and the remainder is discarded. Mathematically, 435 divided by 100 is

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:43.120
of course 4.35. And then, the 0.35 is gone. The leftover is 4 as an integer.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.682
And that number here is now saved as the dollars. That's just what we want,

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:54.492
right? 435 pennies is $4. What if we also want the pennies, for that we have a

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:59.986
different operator called the modulus operator, and we often just pronounce it

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:09.160
as mod. By the operand on the right, let's try that out with 435. 435 divided

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.859
by 100 is 4. So, there's 4 times 100 going in here. When we take those off,

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:21.256
we're left with a remainder of 35. That was no longer divisble by 100. That's

00:01:21.256 --> 00:01:25.530
what the remainder operator yields. You can see that by making an integer

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.118
division by 100, and then also a reminder operation with 100 then we get the

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:36.385
dollars and the cents value. Now, it's time for you try this tell me what is.

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:41.233
Pennies integer divided by ten and pennies mod 10.
