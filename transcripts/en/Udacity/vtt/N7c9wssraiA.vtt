00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.102
I know 4 squared is really 16, and 5 squared is really 25. I know 16 plus 25

00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:10.332
makes 41. So, I have a total area 41. For the blue side, I have 20 plus 16 plus

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:15.771
20 plus 25. When I add all these areas together, I get an area of 81. This makes

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:21.110
sense because I know if I would have just combined the sides, I would have had

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:25.515
9, and then I would've squared it. 9 squared is 81. I know these two numbers are

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:30.205
not equal. We want to be really careful. Exponents cannot distribute over sums

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.325
or differences. We can't just say 4 plus 5 squared is the same thing as 4

00:00:33.857 --> 00:00:37.547
squared plus 5 squared. This is a key concept that we will come back to later. I

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:41.975
just want to preview it for now and give you an idea of area models. This is

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:45.875
going to help us problem solve. Now, let's have you practice with some

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:46.485
exponents.
