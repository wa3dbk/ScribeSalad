00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.090
So you can say, well, it's awkward
kernel design at the heart or

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.860
the center or core of it.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.070
What really goes into it?

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.690
What is included in the trusted
computing base when it is done

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.380
by using the security
kernel kind of an approach.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.050
So we said, well, last one we're saying
everything that is necessary for

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.820
the mechanisms, that are necessary for
correct enforcement of security policies

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.220
we want to have in
the system should go there.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.570
We know resources are implemented
using physical resources we have,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.380
so any I/O that's necessary to access
your physical resources, primitive I/O

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.640
has to be handled in there, which
includes clocks, interrupt handling,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.190
at least capturing the interrupt,
and being able to directly access

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.340
the hardware resources with whatever
capabilities that are necessary for it.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.770
In memory, for example,
we said we have TLBs or

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.580
speeding up the address translation
process and things like that.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.190
So who can manipulate those control
part of memory, somebody can use.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.550
So that kind of stuff, if you're doing
manager access control, then there's

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.910
label checking, that the model is
going to rely on notion of labels and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.880
making sure secret information
doesn't flow into an object that is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560
unclassified and things like that.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.360
So that's part of your security policy
and the correct enforcement, of course,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.680
has to be implemented
by the security kernel.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.920
And direct access to hardware resources
and their manipulation, and support for

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.510
these various models for access
control we have has to be in that.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.010
The other thing we did is
sort of virtualization.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.220
One way we get sort of a complete
mediation, and you can bypass it,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.570
is that untrusted code is,
has handles who worked with resources.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.188
Unless we're talking
about capability systems.

00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:45.240
So this virtualization, were putting
this mechanism going from virtual to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.860
physical resources helps us isolate
the hardware from untrusted code.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.360
It also allows us to do the separation
