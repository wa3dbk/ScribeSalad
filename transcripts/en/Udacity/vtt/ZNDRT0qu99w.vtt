00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
After we have fixed the program we need to check two things.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
First, we need to check whether the same error has been made elsewhere.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In our case, if there is a programmer who has confused the precedence

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of ors and ands, it may be a good thing to check the code for other places,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and to make sure that all of these have proper parentheses around them,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which anyway is a good programming practice.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Second, we want to make sure that the error does not occur again.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we can do so either by writing appropriate tests, see the other Udacity

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
course for how to do that.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Or, we can include appropriate assertion in the code that makes sure the error will not occur again.
