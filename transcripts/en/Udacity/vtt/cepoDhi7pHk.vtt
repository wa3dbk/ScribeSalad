Grant doesn't have time to work with us anymore, because he's so busy selling

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:08.234
tons of glasses wipers and nozzles. And plus, he already learned a ton from us

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:12.350
about algebra. So, he's referred me to someone else who he thinks is going to

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.238
help put a new spin on ways that algebra shows up in the real world. Our new

00:00:16.238 --> 00:00:21.010
friend is his cousin, Athena. She says hello, and she is super excited to start

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.069
working with us. Now, just to give you some basic info about Athena. She is a

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:29.397
college student living in UdaCity. In school, she is majoring in architecture,

00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:33.179
but she's still taking classes in some other subjects, including college

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.214
algebra. Athena loves hanging out with her friends and her family and she has a

00:00:37.214 --> 00:00:41.060
really cute dog and a really cute cat. So, all in all, Athena leads a pretty

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.713
happy life.
