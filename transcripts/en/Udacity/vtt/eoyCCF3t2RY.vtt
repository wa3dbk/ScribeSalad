00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.510
I find that the easiest way
to keep things straight,

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.310
is to think about this relation
as referring to hardness.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.630
Thus, I would read this as
saying B is as hard as A.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.920
The word reduction also
makes sense in this light.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.890
We are reducing the hardness
of A to that of B.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.510
The answer of course is the first and
the last.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.354
If there's a decider for B then
that let's us build the decider for

00:00:25.354 --> 00:00:27.620
A just by composing with the reduction.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.490
And the last statement is just
a counter positive of the first.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.210
The second statement is false because it
might very well be that A is decidable,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.190
but B is not.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.600
A could be easy while B could be hard.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.250
And the same logic applies
to the third state.
