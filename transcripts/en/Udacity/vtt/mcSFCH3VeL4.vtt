00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.908
Yes Lauren, some of you may remember the case of my brother David. He was the

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:09.509
one who was hit by a car riding his bike home back from work. And he was in a

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.529
coma for couple of weeks, and then vegetative for a few months. And he suffered

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.220
both kinds of amnesia, retrograde and anterior grade. So for instance in

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.692
retrograde, he would forget about the 9 months prior to the accident, so we

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:27.332
asked him, for instance, who his roommates were, who he lived with during that

00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:34.724
period. He could not tell us. Likewise, interiograde amnesia, he would forget

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:39.429
new events, after the accident. So, for instance, he meet somebody and then the

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:45.574
next day. Meet him again, he's completely forgotten ever having met them. So he

00:00:45.574 --> 00:00:48.724
suffered both retrograde and anterograde amnesia.
