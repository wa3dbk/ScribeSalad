Now, remember from the sense Olympics, we discussed the basic process involved

00:00:03.526 --> 00:00:07.912
in sensation and perception. And we see that our sensory memory system is quite

00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:12.016
clear cut. Remember that our sensory neurons take information from external

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:16.570
stimuli and our sensory organs to different parts of the brain. Recall that

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.665
sensation travels to the thalamus, which then relays a sensor information to

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:25.952
the cerebral cortex where it gets further processed. Three out of our five

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:30.990
sensory systems have a specific cortex for processing sensory stimuli.
