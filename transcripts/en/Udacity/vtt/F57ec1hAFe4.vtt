00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.022
We want the code to do the same thing that it did before, but now if there

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:05.864
isn't a next double the first time, we want to print an error instead of

00:00:05.864 --> 00:00:11.286
collecting values and calculating the sum and the average. So I'll ask the user

00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:15.129
to enter a value and then if n has another double, we'll go into the while loop

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.182
and eventually calculate the average. So I'll indent all of this to put it

00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:24.582
inside of this clause. Now if they don't enter a double, I'll catch that with

00:00:24.582 --> 00:00:28.538
an else clause, I'll print out an error message. Let's check out whether this

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:32.067
worked or not. If I enter a bad value, I get the message I wanted, and if I

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:36.210
enter good values, then it calculates the average.
