00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.140
Okay, so I've got it now.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.550
Now that we have
the application packaged up,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.120
it's got to be time to copy
down to the server and run it.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.550
&gt;&gt; Slow down there Cowboy,
while you could do that,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.960
it kind of defeats the point the whole
point of using Docker was to make it

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.740
easy to distribute your applications.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.730
What you propose works for
a small set of machines but

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.530
won't scale to say a hundred machines.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.730
The right thing to do in this case
is to push your container images

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.780
to a remote repository and leverage
tools like Docker to fetch those images

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.940
from a central place
when we need to run them.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.570
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think I've heard of those.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.350
Are you talking about Docker Hub?

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.220
&gt;&gt; But if I use that can't
anyone access my containers?

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.480
&gt;&gt; Yes, all images you push to
the Docker Hub are public by default.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.530
But don't worry, you also have the
option to make those images private and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.140
limit access to them.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.050
You also have the flexibility to share
some images public and others private.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.840
This often is the case when companies
have open source projects they want to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.470
share with the world but
keep their secret sauce to themselves.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, I get it but I think this is
something I need to see in action.
