00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.320
So how do we compute discrete gradients?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.640
Well, what we want is,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.200
we want to come up with a, an operator, a mask or a kernel.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.020
Remember this, what we looked at before.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.056
That effectively computes the discrete derivatives using cross-correlation.

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:19.719
I've always been talking about this whole concept to find a difference,

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:23.677
which basically is nothing else but a numerical solution where basically we'd

00:00:23.677 --> 00:00:27.303
solve a differential equation using an approximation of derivatives.

00:00:27.303 --> 00:00:30.579
And in this case we basically come up with differences from one column to

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.770
the other, or one row to the other.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.081
So what we are interested in, and we did this previously,

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:40.472
is come up with a simple kernel, that when applied to an original image,

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:45.360
in a cross-correlation framework, could be used to, generate a derivative.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.541
How do we do this for discrete, images?

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.655
Well we want to be able to compute discrete gradients.

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.441
We want to be looking for gradients in x and y direction.

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:59.059
Again, remember, this was my equation looking for a change in x and y.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.845
In this case y is going to remain the same because I'm going column by column.

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:08.170
In this case, I will be going, row by row and keep the same column.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.160
So, kinds of kernels we can generate to help assist with this are, for

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.870
example this one.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.254
Where basically now I have zeros here, minus one, one, zero and zero.

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:19.640
Of course I use this in a cross correlation framework.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.260
I'll be able to now generate a del x, our gradient change in x image.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.360
So those of you who are thinking how would I get the Hy,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990
well I would actually just transpose this.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.660
Now again, so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.350
far we're talking about computing gradients using cross correlation.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.830
We're basically using Hx and Hy as the two kernels.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.010
Those of you who remember our conversation about cross correlation and

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.390
convolution should be, be able to easily kind of predict how would we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.910
use the method of convolution here.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.444
And what we would have to do, the Hx and Hy, to be able to

00:01:54.444 --> 00:01:59.080
actually use the convolution process rather than the cross correlation process.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.970
because remember, this is not a, symmetric in both an x and y kernel.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.450
This symmetric in one axis but not both.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.020
So, ideally, a kernel should have some symmetry about an image point.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.590
And, overall, by combining these two,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.040
you might actually notice there is overall symmetry.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.720
So one question remains.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.010
Is where is the middle point of these kernels?

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.830
Remember the processing we have actually done before where we have to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.540
look at and create a nine by nine kernel and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.090
then use that to kind of place the middle value.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.410
In this one, of course, there is no middle term here.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.554
So depending on how the operations are done, sometimes you would actually always

00:02:37.554 --> 00:02:41.412
have, have an image middle point here, or also kind always keep an offset.

00:02:41.412 --> 00:02:43.793
And I'll put an image point here.

00:02:43.793 --> 00:02:46.148
This does have an im, small impact.

00:02:46.148 --> 00:02:49.979
And we looked at it when we did simple differences from moving around the row.

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:54.669
You will always be losing one column if I'm going around columns and

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:59.010
if I'm coming down on rows you would lose one, row.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.490
So this is kind of way basically we will be looking at for information.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.211
But of course, you will also notice that sometimes we want to find kernels which

00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:12.084
allow you to have both symmetry and also, have a much well defined midpoint.

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:16.690
For example, this is one kernel that is widely used.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.109
This should remind you of all of the other kernels we have looked, looked at for

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:21.100
doing averaging.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.650
Here, basically what it's doing is taking the average of the information

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.330
one column to the right and one column to the left.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.740
And of course, zeroing out everything else.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.370
So it's basically, an average of the left and the right derivatives.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.380
So is this a better kernel?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.840
Well, it does have a some features because it does have well defined midpoint.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.360
And also can actually, be used for doing various types of symmetry calculations.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.140
Transposing this, we can get the same kind of kernel in the y direction
