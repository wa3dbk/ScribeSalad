00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.092
Remember that the only numbers that are
natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on

00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:13.955
going up, but counting by ones. If we did
that we would eventually get to 735 so

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:22.169
this is a natural number. So is 6. 89.1
lies between two natural numbers. 89 and

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.705
90 but it in itself is not a natural
number because of the decimal of .1.

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:36.325
-1000 and 1/3 are both less than 1, which is the
smallest natural number, so neither of

00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:44.062
them belong in the set of natural numbers.
Our last answer, 19 however is a natural

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:48.420
number. We can already see this from the
quiz, that there are a lot of numbers out

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.607
there that don't qualify as natural
numbers and we'll talk more about them

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:53.777
very soon.
