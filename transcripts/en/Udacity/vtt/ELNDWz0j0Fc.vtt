00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.412
We need to make sure that x is greater than 0 inches. Now of course if x was

00:00:04.412 --> 00:00:09.110
equal to 0, then we just wouldn't have cut into the box at all. You would have

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.601
just a regular rectangle of paper. And this is physically possible, however

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:17.699
there are no flaps here to fold so it's not really our ideal situation. A

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.224
negative value, however, doesn't make any sense. After all, like we've seen many

00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:26.433
times in different examples throughout this course, measuring negative lengths

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:31.767
is a pretty tricky thing to do. It doesn't make sense in this situation. So,

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:36.803
bottom line, if we want flaps, x must be greater than 0.
