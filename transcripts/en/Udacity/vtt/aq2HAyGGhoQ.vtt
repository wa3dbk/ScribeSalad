00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.860
In the last lesson, we talked about black-box testing or functional testing,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.110
which is the kind of testing that you perform when you just

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.860
look at the description of the software. Today we're going to cover white-box

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.490
testing, which is the kind of testing that we perform when we

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.800
open up the box. We look inside the program, and we actually

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.490
test it based on its code. And there is one basic assumption

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.320
behind the idea of white-box testing, which is a very intuitive one,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.080
and the assumption is that executing the faulty statement is a necessary

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.380
condition for revealing a fault. In other words, if there is

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.690
a bug in the program there is no way were going to be

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.490
able to find this bug or this fault, if we don't execute

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.110
the statement that contains it. Which makes a lot of sense. As

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.240
we did for black-box testing, we're going to start by summarizing what

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.650
are the main advantages of white-box testing. The main advantage is that

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.050
it's based on the code, and as such, the quality of white-box

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.760
testing can be measured objectively. And what I mean here by objectively

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.390
is that if you think about black-box testing In many

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.630
cases, there were subjective decisions, there were had to be made

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.830
in order to define tests in a black-box fashion. In the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.990
case of white-box testing, because everything is based on the quota,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.965
we don't have to make such subjective decisions. And similarly, because

00:01:07.965 --> 00:01:10.680
white-box testing is based on the code, it can be measured

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.250
automatically. So we can build tools and actually there are tools,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.860
and there's plenty of tools, that can be measured, the level

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.670
of white-box testing can be achieved in a fully automated way.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.620
And we're going to see some of them in the course of the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.600
class. Another advantage of white-box testing is that it can be

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.700
used to compare test suites. So if you have two alternative sets

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.270
of tests that you can use to assess the quality of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.360
your software, white-box testing techniques can tell you which one of these

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.580
two test suites is likely to be more effective in testing

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.350
your code. And finally, white-box testing allows for covering the coded behavior

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.470
of the software. What that means is that if there is

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.680
some mistake in the code and is not obvious by looking at

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.300
the specification of the code, white box testing might be able

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.330
to catch it, because it tries to exercise the code. There's many

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.430
different kinds of white box testing, there are control flow based

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.550
techniques, data flow based techniques, and fault based techniques. And for each

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.030
one of these family of techniques there are many variations. So

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.450
this field is very, very broad. In this lesson we will talk

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.110
about white-box testing by focusing

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.910
mainly on control-flow based testing techniques.
