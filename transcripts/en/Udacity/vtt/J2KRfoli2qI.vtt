00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.333
So, you can see how this diagram that I drew earlier works. The circle

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:09.162
representing the natural numbers is within the circle representing the whole

00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:14.135
numbers, showing that the natural numbers are all included in the whole numbers.

00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:19.139
If we pick any number, we can point to which category or categories it fits into

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:25.620
by pointing somewhere on this diagram. For example, if I pick 18, then 18 is a

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:33.299
natural number. So we can point here. But since that circle is inside of the

00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:40.535
whole number circle, we know that 18 is also a whole number. If we pick zero

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:46.812
however, We can only point to the whole number circle, not the natural number

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:52.395
circle since zero is whole, but not natural And if I pick a number like 16.5,

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.152
well, that is not in either of these categories. So we would need to point

00:00:58.164 --> 00:01:03.273
outside of both of these circles. So you can see that we're building up this

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:08.103
sort of world of numbers. And we're going to keep adding more to it. Next, we're

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:12.364
going to talk about integers, which, if we represent them in our world of

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:16.893
numbers here, would be drawn as a circle around the whole numbers like this.

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:21.967
Even though I haven't told you anything about integers yet. Can you tell me just

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.950
by looking at this diagram, which of the following statements are true?
