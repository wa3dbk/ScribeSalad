00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.719
All right, so, this is what I came up with.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.150
First and foremost, we need to set this display method on the projects object.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.030
So, using dot notation, I simply set the property display on

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.990
the project's object and set it equal to a function.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.220
This function is using a for in loop, for projects in projects.projects.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.640
Inside the projects object,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.180
we have an array of projects, also called, well, projects.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.020
Like we said in the hint,

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.020
we need to start with HTMLprojectStart to create a new project entry.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.940
Then you'll see a set of steps where we're appending the title.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.282
The dates, the description, and images to this project entry last element.

00:00:37.282 --> 00:00:42.220
Remember, HTMLprojectStart is creating an element with the class project entry,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.420
and we want to grab the last one every time we work through this list.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.120
Following the same strategies we've been using in this class,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.210
we'll be appending each of these elements to project-entry:last, and

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.090
when we're done, we should see a nice beautiful project section.
