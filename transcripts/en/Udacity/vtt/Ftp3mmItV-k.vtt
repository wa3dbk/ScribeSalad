00:00:00.595 --> 00:00:02.420
It's always important to plot your data.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.350
Let's go through an example y.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.300
I've got here eleven data points, which I've plotted on the right.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.830
We might want to compute some summary statistics about this data set.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.870
Such as its mean, variance, correlation coefficient, and line of best fit.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.322
Now suppose I give you three more data sets with exactly the same

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:23.760
summary statistics, like this.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.747
You'd expect that since these data sets have the same mean,

00:00:26.747 --> 00:00:28.918
variance, correlation coefficient, and

00:00:28.918 --> 00:00:32.439
line of best fit, that they look very similar when visualized.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.820
Let's have a look now.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.630
How similar are these data sets?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.240
Not very.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.510
We can see here the effect of curvature and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.230
outliers have drastically thrown off our summary statistics.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.830
This is something called Anscombe's quartet.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.260
And demonstrates how important it is to always plot your data,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.128
rather than relying on summary statistics alone.

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:56.560
Tools like matplotlib in Python or ggplot in R are great ways to

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.580
plot your data visually, allowing you to pick out visual patterns, trends, and

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.450
outliers during your analysis.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.950
Hopefully, this example has shown you the power of data visualization and

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.190
why you should use it every day.
