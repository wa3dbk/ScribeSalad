00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.662
We can factor this numerator as the difference of two squares. We can write it

00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:10.177
as 6 minus x times 6 plus x. For this denominator we want to find the factors of

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:15.343
negative 48 that sum to positive 2. These factors are negative 6 and positive 8.

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:19.803
When I look at my factors it doesn't seem as if anything can simplify out to

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:24.183
equal 1 but if i look at these two factors i can see that these are opposite

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:29.105
polynomials. The constant term 6 is positive while this one's negative and the x

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:33.578
term is negative here while this x term is positive. This means I'll have a

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:38.275
factor of negative 1. We can see this if we were to just switch the order of the

00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:43.075
terms for these two, we'll have negative 6 plus x, then I can factor a negative

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:48.030
1 from this factor. I'll have negative 1 times positive 6 minus x. I change the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.222
signs of both of these terms since i factored a negative 1 out. These factors of

00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:58.748
6 minus X simplified to 1 but i still have a negative 1 out in front, just like

00:00:58.748 --> 00:01:03.897
I thought here. Whenever you see opposite polynomial factors you can simplify

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:08.580
them to be negative 1. We don't need to show all this work. So we're left with

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.442
this expression. Now, I want to acknowledge there are a lot of different answers

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:16.242
here. This negative sign could have been distributed to either the numerator or

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:20.282
the denominator. If we distribute the negative 1 to the numerator, we could have

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:24.226
gotten this expression. Or switch the order of these terms and you got this

00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:28.574
expression. These are all equal. If we distribute this negative one instead of

00:01:28.574 --> 00:01:33.262
the denominator, we can wind up with any of these expressions. And in fact, all

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:38.043
of these are correct. In general, it's easiest to list the negative sign out in

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:41.633
front of a fraction and then write your rational expressions.
