00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] And here is 1 answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For straight what I did was I said it's a straight if the difference between the max

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the minimum is 4--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
say 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; 6 minus 2 is 4--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and also if all the cards are different.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So make a set out of the ranks, and if the length of that set is 5,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that means if there's 5 different ranks that have a max versus minimum of 4,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
then it's a straight.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For flush what I did is I extracted out the suits,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
iterated over the hand with the r and s being the 2 characters within each card,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
collected up all the s into this list,

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and then I asked, is the length of that set equal to 1?
