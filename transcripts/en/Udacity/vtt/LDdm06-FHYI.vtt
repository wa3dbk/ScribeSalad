Let's just ignore the percent signs for now, as long as we remember that our

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:08.684
units are in percents. We have the sample mean of A minus the sample mean of B,

00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:14.465
divided by the standard error. And if you calculate it, you should get about

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:15.611
0.4.
