All right, as the comment says below,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.002
"Now that we have a location,
let's add some weather."

00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:08.866
Let's implement the weather part
of our insert readDB test.

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.045
I'm going to give you 
some dummy data to help you out.

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:16.776
Note that the location key 
is the rowID of the data we just inserted.

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:20.447
Also note that I can use 
this short syntax for weather entry,

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:23.091
because I added this import 
at the top of the file.

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:26.582
Alright, so we insert that provided data
that I gave you into our database,

00:00:26.582 --> 00:00:29.440
and verify that we can read it
back out again.
