00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.555
If the distance between x and 4 needs to be less than 5, then we can either

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:09.421
count up 5 from 4, which takes us to 9, and draw a round parenthesis there. Or

00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:14.195
we can count down from 4 and 5, which takes us to negative 1, and we can write a

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:19.256
round parenthesis there as well. Any area between these two points is fine as a

00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:24.242
value of x. Looking at this interval, this is something we definitely know how

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:29.103
to handle. These solutions go from negative 1 to 9, non inclusive. And we can

00:00:29.103 --> 00:00:32.775
also write this as negative 1 is less than x is less than 9.
