00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.110
We can use the Quotient rule to do this expansion. The only tricky thing here,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.690
is dealing with this coefficient of 10, outside the log. Since we're seeing,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.620
for example, that log base 10 of P over B, is equal to log base 10 of P, minus

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.820
log base 10 of B. The 10 still needs to multiply this entire expression. So we

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:28.080
have L1 equals 10 times log base 10 of P minus Log base 10 of B. And for L2, we

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.390
have the same thing, except with 2P instead of P.
