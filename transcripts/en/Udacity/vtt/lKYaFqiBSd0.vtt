00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.412
And that's compact. Now the sharp viewer might note that we're going to see vertex 4 twice in the next frontier.

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:07.748
Now the algorithm's going to work okay with duplicates.

00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:09.832
It's going to work correctly; it's just wasteful.

00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:12.286
And this turns out to be a tricky problem to solve in parallel

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:14.051
and it's beyond the scope of this talk,

00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:18.000
but you might consult Merrill's paper for a couple of interesting solutions.
