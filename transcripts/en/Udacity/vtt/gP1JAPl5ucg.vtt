00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.329
So now we are in a really great position.
We have an equation that actually has

00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:08.891
numbers in it. However, it's time for me
to make a confession. I'm really, really

00:00:08.903 --> 00:00:13.367
lazy. I'm just super tired of writing out
all these words in our equation. I know

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.026
that it is important first to keep in mind
what are equations about. But I think that

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:22.776
we can remember that. Even if we do take a
few shortcuts as long as I remember what

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:27.169
belongs in this spot of the equation or
what this part of the equation means. I

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:31.636
might as well rewrite money Grant has left
with something shorter. I've kind of

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:36.376
already taken a few shortcuts already. For
example, I've used a dollar sign instead

00:00:36.388 --> 00:00:40.965
of writing out the word money. And I used
a pound sign instead of writing out the

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:45.344
words, number of. So it's okay to take
shortcuts, as long as they make sense to

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:50.003
us. So the thing that I decide to replace
these words with could be, really whatever

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:53.955
we want. A single letter, or a single
symbol. I think I'm going to use a,

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:58.871
square. We can do a similar thing for
number of months over here. Going with the

00:00:58.883 --> 00:01:04.310
geometry theme, I am going to call this,
triangle, instead of number of months. So

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:09.115
what I'm really doing here then, is
assigning a new name, to each of these

00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:14.041
parts of the equation. We're going to say
that square equals money Grant has left,

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:18.967
and triangle equals number of months. So
let's rewrite this top equation up here.

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:24.405
Using our new symbols. Here are four spots
that we need to fill in to make our new

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:29.989
equation. or rather, our modified version
of the original equation. Please pick from

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:35.044
the buttons under each slot to select
which number or symbol belongs in the box

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:36.152
above. Good luck.
