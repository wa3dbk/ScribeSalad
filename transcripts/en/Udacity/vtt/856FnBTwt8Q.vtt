00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.640
What would be more general is to have the transparent filter's color affect the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.086
color behind it. In other words, we want to blend the two colors. In blending in

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:12.690
computer graphics, the original color is called the "destination" and the color of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.402
the transparent object we're looking through is called the "source" color. We'd

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:20.954
also like to control how much can be seen through this filter. In computer

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:26.818
graphics this control value is called "alpha". Here it represents our filter's

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:31.495
opacity. When alpha is one, the filter is fully opaque and does not let any

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:35.819
light through. As this value decreases, more of the destination color becomes

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:39.464
visible. Here I'm just showing how the red is affected; the blue would show

00:00:39.464 --> 00:00:44.710
through. When alpha is zero, our filter is entirely transparent and has no

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.088
effect. A typical way to blend these colors is by using this equation. Here, the

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:53.136
color of the source of our filter is multiplied by the source's alpha. This

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:57.340
gives how much the source will affect the final color. The larger alpha is, the

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.183
more the source color affects the final color. To counterbalance this, this same

00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:06.739
alpha is subtracted from one, and this value determines how much the destination

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:11.100
color influences the result. This type of blend is called an "over" operator, as

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.440
it gives the effect of putting one color over another. The alpha of the source,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.781
our transparent filter, can be any value from zero to one. If the value is zero,

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.750
this equation simply becomes "C" is equal to the destination color, since the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.338
source filter is entirely transparent. If the value of alpha is one, the source

00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:34.486
is fully opaque and hides what ever it's being placed over. The equation

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:38.300
simplifies as expected, with the final color being the same as the source color.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.657
The alpha value blends between these two colors. Another way to say it is that

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:49.389
the equation performs linear interpolation. As one color's influence increases,

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:54.624
the other color's effect drops off in proportion. This idea of having a control

00:01:54.624 --> 00:01:59.310
value, in this case, alpha, that varies between zero and one is commonly used in

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.524
many areas of computer graphics. Expect to see this sort of equation elsewhere

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:09.098
as you explore the field. The over operator is useful for transparency. However

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:13.099
there are many other blend modes available on WebGL. For example, one blend mode

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.156
is called "add" as it adds the source and destination colors together. In three.js the

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:21.585
blend mode used is specified with the material's blending parameter. Here we see

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:26.124
the over equation in action. By varying the alpha, we fade the effect of the

00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:29.324
transparent object on and off. Try it yourself.
