00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.930
So far, we've seen two aggregation operators, group and sort. There

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.920
are several others in addition to these two. I'm going to

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.790
go through each one briefly to explain how it works. I'll

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.160
just summarize them here. Later we'll dig into each one individually, and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.670
I'll show you what it does. All right, so the first

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.300
operator we'll look at is project. I've put together some dummy

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.590
data here that we can use as we talk about each

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.260
one of these operators. Now, the project operator, allows you to shape

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.130
documents you receive as input into what you need for

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.050
the next stage. The simplest form of shaping is using

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.880
project to select which fields you're interested in exactly. Like

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.050
we did in the last lesson, when projecting out the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.060
motto for cities, and other single fields we were interested

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.160
in looking at. So for example here, if in the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.650
documents I receive to my stage in which I'm using

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.410
the project operator, I'm interested, say, in this field, and perhaps

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.570
this one as well. Then I can use the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.030
Project operator to simply pull out these individual values, regardless

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.780
of where they're nested in the input documents. And,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.120
project them out in documents, into the next stage of

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.740
the pipeline, or the result if I'm at the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.490
end of the pipeline. We'll look at the syntax for

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.110
Project a little bit later. Essentially with Project I can

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.990
take the fields I receive in an individual document, and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.070
perform a number of different types of operations on

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.100
them, in order to produce documents for the next stage

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.000
of the pipeline. Select is one. I could also

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.390
say, for example, as we'll look at later, produce a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.970
ratio based on two numeric fields and create a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.910
new field that will then be passed on in documents

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.380
to the next stage of the pipeline. The next

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.790
operator I want to look at is match. Match filters documents,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.130
so for example, I might set up some match criteria

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.880
that might cause me to end up filtering, so that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.170
I only ended up with this document and this document.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.920
&gt;From the documents I was passed as input to my aggregation

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.860
stage using the new match operator. I can, of course,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.200
also group and sort. And we looked at a pretty detailed

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.610
example for both of these, so I wont' go into

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.290
further detail here. So the next operator I'd like to cover

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.710
is skip. Skip is designed to allow us to simply

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.880
skip over a certain number of documents at the beginning

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.850
of our input set of documents to the aggregation stage

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.550
using skip. So, for example, if I wanted to skip

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.020
the first three input documents. Then the first document I

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.530
would output would be this one, and all documents following

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.975
it. Limit kind of does the reverse of skip, so

00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:31.354
in this case, if I limited what I was passing on

00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:34.861
to the next stage of the pipeline to three documents. Then what I

00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.303
would be doing, is simply taking those

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:40.640
three documents and filtering out everything else.
