00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:02.360
&gt;&gt; All right, so turns out it, it matters how we

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.200
select training examples when when a learner is needing to learn.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.590
So let's at least articulate some various ways that training examples

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.610
could be selected. And then for each one we might end

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.270
up with a different answer as to how much training data

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.930
is going to be needed, if the training examples are selected in

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.290
that particular way. So, so what do you think, Charles? Are

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.420
there, there any ways you can think of for selecting training examples?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.920
&gt;&gt; Well, so, I, I, I so here's how

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.650
I think about it. So, you keep using the word

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.490
learner, and when there's a learner there's often a

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.720
teacher. So, I'm trying to think about this in the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.310
different ways that learners and teachers can interact. So,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.030
I'm going to try to think about my, my experience as

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.600
a professor. So, there are a couple. Here's one,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.770
one is: sometimes the learner asks questions of the teacher.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.450
&gt;&gt; I see,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.520
so in this case, the learner would be

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.480
selecting the training examples. The learner would say,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.760
I, you know, here's, here's an input x, would you please tell me c of x?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.090
&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly what I mean, right,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.390
right. Then there's another case. So the learner

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.520
asks questions of the teacher. But sometimes the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.660
teacher just goes ahead and gives x, c(x) pairs.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.310
&gt;&gt; And let's say it's, it actually is trying to help the learner.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.020
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.530
&gt;&gt; So

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.700
it's a, friendly teacher.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.438
&gt;&gt; Okay, I've had some of those.

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:20.030
&gt;&gt; Good, all right so, the, it could be

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.020
the, the learner asking to try to get data.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.580
It could be the teacher asking to try to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.380
lead the learner to something good. And, anything else?

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.870
&gt;&gt; Well, so, I like this, this way of thinking about it. Because

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.480
it sort of makes sense in my world as a professor, but it doesn't actually

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.120
sound like either of things is what we've been looking at so far. What

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.580
I think we've been looking at so far is that somehow the Xs and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.780
the CXs, the training examples, just come out of nowhere.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.290
They come from some underlying distribution. It's just nature. It's just

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.200
coming at us from some process that we don't know what

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.600
that process is. Yeah, I like that. So in some sense

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.030
there's three individuals that could be asking for examples. There's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.430
the teacher, there's the learner, and there's, like, the world around

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.140
them. And, and, the things could come from any of those.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.400
I guess another possibility would be that questions are asked specifically

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.699
in an evil way. All right, so all

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.810
of these different kinds of distributions or, or

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.760
ways of selecting training examples are actually going

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.140
to come into play in the stuff that

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.080
we're talking about. Let's let's use the first

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.370
couple to get a sense of why these

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.810
things might be different from each other. So

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.840
let's go back to this notion of 20 questions.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.540
&gt;&gt; Okay.
