00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.552
So, let's see what is memory consistency

00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:06.190
and how it differs from coherence. What coherence

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.720
does is define the order of accesses

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.100
observable by different threads, if these accesses go

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.750
to the same memory location or to the same address. Coherence is needed in order

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.970
to share data. Without coherence, a thread

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.270
is allowed to modify memory location while another

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.910
thread is allowed to read forever the old

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.460
value of that location, in which case we

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.600
can not really write shared memory programs that

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.456
work. An important thing about coherence, however, is

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:39.832
that it defines the order of accesses to

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:43.130
the same address. It does not say anything

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.280
about accesses that go to different location. And

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.340
that is what memory consistency is about. It defines

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.037
the order of accesses to different addresses. So, the

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:57.331
big question now, before we get into consistencies, does this

00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:00.320
even matter? If we guarantee that when I write

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.520
to something, all the other cores get to see it,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.220
and that happens for every address. As in, I

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.530
write to A, somebody sees what I wrote. I write

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.210
to B, somebody sees what I wrote. What can

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.460
change about the order of accesses to different addresses and

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.090
how does that even matter if I need to maintain this?
