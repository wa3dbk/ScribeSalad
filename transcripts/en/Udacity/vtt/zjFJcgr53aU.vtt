00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.370
By the end of this work session you'll
be able to replace the words noun and

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.990
verb in a string, with your own input.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.981
You'll do this in two different ways,
and

00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:10.873
you'll see how your new knowledge
of strings can be applied.

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:14.086
Now, this might not seem like a big
deal, just replacing the words noun and

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:16.993
verb in a single string, but trust me,
this is a fundamental part of

00:00:16.993 --> 00:00:19.550
the Mad Lib generator you're
well on your way to building.
