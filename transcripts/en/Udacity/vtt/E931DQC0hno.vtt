00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.627
Remember, a problem with histograms which you learned in lesson two. We

00:00:04.627 --> 00:00:09.923
sacrifice detail for convenience. Because of these bins, we can't determine the

00:00:09.923 --> 00:00:15.062
proportional values less than or greater than certain numbers. We want to know

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:20.002
things like this, though, to see how certain scores compare to other scores in

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:25.221
the distribution. So what will allow us more detail? Adding more values to the

00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:28.989
data set, increasing the bin size, or a smaller bin size?
