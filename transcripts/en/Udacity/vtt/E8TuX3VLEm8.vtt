00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.123
Let's see if a similar sort of reduction happens with another rational

00:00:03.123 --> 00:00:07.986
function. How about we play with this one? F of x equals x squared minus 1 over

00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:13.640
2 times x squared minus 3x plus 2. How would you factor the numerator and the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.816
denominator of this function? Please just factor for now. No cancelling

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:18.849
anything out yet.
