00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want you to program this now.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want you to run 1,000 simulations

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
using a function simulate that you have to fill in.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this simulation, you count how often you succeed in the variable k.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You pick a random door using the function randint.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you give it the parameter 1,3 it picks a number between 1 and 3 at random.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You make your own choice using the same function randint,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then you have to emulate Monty.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Sometimes it picks it deterministically. Sometimes it picks it stochastically.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Write that code and then flip your choice of the remaining door.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If that remaining door is correct, implement k.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Otherwise, don't increment k.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When you run this 1,000 times, your output should be approximately 2/3.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This program requirement requires real knowledge of Python.

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you're new to all this, feel free to skip it. It is a big challenging.
