00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.290
But accessibility considerations
won't be enough to reach all users,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.620
you also need to consider localization.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.150
To reach the most users,
your application should handle text,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.050
audio files, numbers, currency and
graphics in ways appropriate to

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.870
the locales where your
application will be used.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.190
This is actually pretty simple if you
use the Android resource framework

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.980
to separate the localized
aspects of your application

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.190
from the core Java functionality.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.840
You can put most of the contents of
your apps UI into resource files,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.490
whereas the behavior of the UI
is driven by your Java code.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.513
For example, if users input
data that needs to formatted or

00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:37.910
sorted differently depending on locale.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.780
Then you would use Java to handle
the data programmatically.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.370
But alternative strings or
layouts can live in the XML.
