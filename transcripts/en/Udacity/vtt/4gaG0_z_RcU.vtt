00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.093
Keyframing is a basic tool in the animator's box, perhaps the first one

00:00:03.093 --> 00:00:06.545
learned. The whole idea is this: to animate an object, save its state at

00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:10.670
various times and interpolate among these. For example, I have an object I

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.226
want to move from one position to another over time. At time A, I record the

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:18.918
position in time. At time B, I do the same. When I want to run the animation,

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:22.844
given a time, I can get the position. This is a linear interpolation between

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:26.955
positions A and B. The process of generating these frames in between the

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:30.677
keyframes is called tweening. We can do the same thing with the drinking bird,

00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:34.590
interpolating between its two rotation angles, down and upright. Here's a set

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.530
of keyframes, A and B, and what we've shown is the times that they occur. Since

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.666
we want to loop, we give two keyframes and then we go back and repeat. A is the

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:46.135
bird in the down position about to go up. B is the bird in the up position

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:50.586
about to go down. Here's the timeline of our animation. We start with the bird

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:53.810
down, he goes up over two seconds and then he goes back down again over three

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.371
seconds. A is our keyframe for down, B is our keyframe for up, and they have

00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:02.758
associated angles. We can use these two keyframes to form a loop for our

00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:06.420
animation. One improvement we can easily add with keyframes is making the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.025
drinking bird pause while it's drinking. We add another keyframe to our

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:14.708
timeline, call it C, where the object is held in the down position. C and A are

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.332
identical, the same down position, they're just different locations on the

00:01:17.332 --> 00:01:22.003
timeline. The bird is held in place while the time is between C and A. Here's a

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:25.740
graph of time versus the drinking bird's angle. With our initial drinking bird

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.829
animation, the end of the swing backwards is particularly unconvincing. The

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.507
bird abruptly stops and moves forward again. With linear interpolation you get

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:38.066
just that, linear motion. As you transition from one pair of keyframes to

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.203
another the motion can suddenly change. To make the transition look smoother

00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:44.887
its common to use spline curves of various sorts to change the motion from

00:01:44.887 --> 00:01:48.665
keyframe to key frame. You'll also see the terms ease in or ease out which

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:52.705
means to start or end the animation gradually from a stop. 3JS has an add-on

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:58.240
library called Tween.min.js that let's you set up a series of keyframes. With

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.340
this library, here's my attempt to improve the drinking bird by using five

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.400
keyframes total. I added an extra two keyframes at the end to get a wobble.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.949
You'll get to take a closer look and critique it in a minute.
