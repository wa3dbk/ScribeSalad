00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.210
I'll take a look at
the smaller layout first.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.720
Box A takes up 50% of the viewport,
and has an order of negative 1,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.430
which looks like it's the lowest
meaning box A comes first, but

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.370
probably means the Red Box is box A.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.440
Container 2 has a width of 50% and
no order.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.320
So, I think it's probably a good
guess that container 2 is

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.300
talking about the light blue and
the green divs.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.830
I can see that boxB must
come after boxA, and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.050
because this doesn't have an order,
it's probably order 0,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
so that means that boxB is
going to be the Dark Blue Box.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.480
That probably means
the Green Box is boxC.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.710
But, I want to take up the larger
viewport to confirm my suspicions.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.290
I can see that boxC has an order of
negative 1 in the larger viewport,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.870
which means that it looks like
it's going to come first.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.780
That's a pretty good argument
that the Green Box is boxC,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.070
but let’s just goes ahead and make sure.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.860
Box B has a width of 25%,
and an order of 2.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.670
Which is the largest one I see here,
so it's probably going to come last.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.720
Well that seems to make sense, because I
said that the Dark Blue Box is boxB, and

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.760
here boxB seems to be the last one.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.190
BoxA is 25% and comes right before boxB.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.860
Which makes it the red one.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.230
So, I'm feeling pretty good about
my answer that the Red Box is boxA.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.840
And lastly, there's still this
container class with a width of 50%.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.210
And it looks like it's still being
applied to the light blue, and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.710
the green boxes.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.150
So, in the end, boxA is Red,
boxC is Green, and boxB is Dark Blue.
