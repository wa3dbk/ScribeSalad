00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's now talk about the second part of this lesson called PID control.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
PID control is a vast field in control, and many, many classes can be taught about this one subject matter.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What I'll do is I'll give you the very basics, and I'll let you implement the very basics.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I promise it'll be fun.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You'll be able to drive a car around, and the Google car to the present day uses a version

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of this exact same controller that is, of course, much more tuned the specifics of our car.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But you get to see some of the essence of what it means to control a car.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here is the problem. Consider the following car with a steerable front axle and 2 non-steerable wheels in the back.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Say we wished this car to drive along this line, which is the output of our smoother we just discussed.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's assume the car has a fixed forward velocity,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but you have the ability to set the steering angle of the car. How would you do this?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You would keep the steering constant?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You would use random steering commands?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Or you could set the steering angle in proportion to what's known as the "crosstrack error,"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is the lateral distance between the vehicle and the so-called reference trajectory.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The third possibility is steer in proportion to the this crosstrack error or CTE.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Choose one of those that you think is best suited to control the car.
