00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.004
All we need to do here is substitute this expression into the slot for n and the

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:10.109
equation for p. Once we've done that, we just distribute multiplication by c to

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:14.931
the two terms in the parentheses here. And that gives us a final answer of p

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.373
equals negative 200 c squared plus 18,000 c minus m.
