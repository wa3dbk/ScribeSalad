00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.689
The National Institute of Standards and
Technology, which adapted a definition

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.200
for cloud computing in 2011 also
defined different types of clouds.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.930
The first dimension how
clouds are classified

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.400
is based on the deployment models.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.260
Clouds can be public like
Amazon's EC2 cloud is a public cloud.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.890
And this is a cloud where
the infrastructure belongs to the cloud

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.050
provider.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.370
However, third party customers or
tenants,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.549
anyone with a credit card really,
can come in and run their services,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.350
their infrastructure,
on top of Amazon's own hardware.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.780
Clouds can be private.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.770
I said earlier that Amazon
used the same type of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.140
technology that they opened
up as Amazon Web Services.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.060
They used it originally
internally to enable elastic and

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.260
dynamic provisioning of the physical
infrastructure across the different

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.630
types of applications and services
that Amazon internally executes.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.630
In the case of a private cloud,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.540
it is the infrastructure
as well as the tenants,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.590
the services, the applications, that
are run on top of that infrastructure.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.260
Everything is owned by
the same entity and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.460
it's just cloud computing technology is
used to enable some of the provisioning

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.470
and the elasticity that cloud
computing offers to applications.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.380
Then there is a hybrid cloud as
a possible deployment model.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.330
This is a scenario where a private
cloud is interfaced with some public

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.730
cloud where these public resources
are used either for failover for

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.930
some additional redundancy,
for dealing with spikes.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.580
I know of certain companies who
choose these public resources

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.830
to run simulated workloads
that would then generate

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.110
supposed request patterns on top of
their, privately run core services.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.020
Finally the definition also

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.330
references that there is a community
cloud as a type of cloud.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.890
This is really just a public cloud
where the third party customers or

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.400
the third party users of the services or
the information that's provided by this

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.530
community cloud, isn't really just
used by arbitrary customers but

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.060
by a certain type of users.
