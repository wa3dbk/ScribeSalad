00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.545
So 2,508 megahertz is 2,508 times 10 to the 6 clocks per second.

00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:10.202
Memory bus of 128 bits is equal to 16 bytes per clock.

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:12.280
So if you multiply this out,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.663
the maximum theoretical peak bandwidth of the memory system

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:19.857
is going to be just over 40 gigabytes per second.

00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:21.990
And as a rough rule of thumb,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.535
anytime we achieve something like 40 to 60% of the memory bandwidth,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:30.357
we'd say, "Well, that's doing okay. It's not great. There's probably room for improvement."

00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:34.418
If you can get into the 60 to 75% range, that's doing pretty well.

00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:36.469
You might not be able to improve on that.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.322
And any time you get over 75%, we would consider that excellent, okay?

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:44.081
You'll never achieve this theoretical peak bandwidth on any real substantial code, okay?

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:48.133
This is literally just what you get from multiplying out the clock rate and the memory bus,

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.484
and a real code is going to have an additional overhead.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:53.649
So if you can get over 75% of that, you're doing really well,

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.960
and you probably don't need to optimize the memory further.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.691
So how well are we doing in this code?
