00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.300
Now before we wrap this project up, I want to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.850
take a minute to connect some of the ideas that

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.300
we have seen in this lesson thus far. We started

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.290
out by creating squares and we wrote a piece of

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.890
code that said brad is equal to turtle.Turtle. What we

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.090
were really doing behind the scenes there is creating an

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.818
object or an instance of the class turtle. What we

00:00:22.818 --> 00:00:26.820
could then do with that instance is things like brad.forward.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.730
We then wanted to do things like read contents

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.960
from a file on our computer, so we wrote a

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.300
piece of code that said quotes equal to open a

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.422
file location. What we were really doing behind the scenes

00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:42.070
there, is create an object of the type file. We

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.560
could then do things with that object like quotes.read. And

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.460
when we wanted to access a website on the internet,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.040
we wrote a piece of code that said connection is

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.270
equal to urllib.urlopen. Now this piece of

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.930
code also returned a file-like object or instance

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.210
and we could then do things with

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.900
that instance, like connection.read. In all three of

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.600
these examples, we created instances or objects

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.373
and then we used those objects. Now some

00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:16.620
of you may say that in the profanity editor example, all we used were functions.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.650
Functions like open and urlopen and that there was no class like we saw in the

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.890
previous example with turtle. Well even though on surface

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.450
it looks like we did not use any classes

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.420
in the profanity editor example, if you look at

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.950
how functions like open and urlopen are actually implemented

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.470
in Python, we will find that some classes init

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.580
like function is being called to return these objects.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.730
Okay, let's look at one more example of how to

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.820
use classes. Things will get a lot clearer after that.
