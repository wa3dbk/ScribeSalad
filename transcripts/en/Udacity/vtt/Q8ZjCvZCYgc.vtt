00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.430
Why don't we apply Mapreduce to our class projects?

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.090
This week, we're going to synthesize all of our findings up to this point,

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.600
the statistical analysis, the data driven predictions, and visualizations

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.540
into a blog post that your friends or family would be able to read if they

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.950
wanted to learn some interesting facts about the New York City subway system.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.860
It's often helpful to begin a blog post with some interesting, but

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.890
basic facts about the subject you'll be discussing.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
You might recall earlier in this course, I provided some statistics about

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.420
the New York City subway, like daily ridership, number of stops, ect.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.570
I'd like you to collect some statistics, about our New York City subway data.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.440
More specifically, how many subway riders were there,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.420
over the course of May 2011?

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.230
And how many people passed through each station on an average day

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.650
using the Mapreduce programming model?
