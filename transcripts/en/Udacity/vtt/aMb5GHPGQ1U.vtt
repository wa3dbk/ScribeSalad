00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.630
As it turns, out the efficiency of quick
sort is actually pretty complicated.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.250
First, let's just focus
on the worst case.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.950
What would that look like?

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.860
The magic of this algorithm
is that it cuts the number

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.459
of comparisons you need to do.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.410
By splitting the array in half,
pretty much every time.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.710
So, the worst case for us would be if
we couldn't split the array in half and

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.620
had to do all of
the comparisons every time.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.310
You'll end up doing all of the
comparisons if the pivots are actually,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.990
already in the right place.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.800
Since 13 is already the biggest element,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.100
we'll end up comparing it to
everything else on the first go.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.500
And realizing that it
doesn't need to move.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.540
This is a lot of comparisons
to do at once, but

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.600
the real problem happens when
the next value is also the largest.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.520
Again, we end up comparing to
everything smaller than it and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.360
we're not saving any steps.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.910
Hopefully, the number of comparisons
here reminds you of bubble sort.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.629
Remember in Bubble sort,
we would have to compare each

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.400
element to the one next to it,
again and again and again and again.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.629
Eventually, we could leave off
the ones that were at the end,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.890
because we knew they
were in the right place.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.200
The worst case of Quick Sort is exactly
the same which means that the worst

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.600
case of Quick Sort is
actually big O of n squared.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.539
For something called a Quick Sort,
that's a really terrible efficiency.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.600
However, Quick Sort is useful for
two main reasons.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.660
First of all, the average and best
case complexity are actually nlogin.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.570
In a good case, the pivot will
move down to the middle and

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.669
we'll get to divide the array
in half every time.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.580
With our pivot in the middle, we can
look at the other halves of the array

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.100
and move their pivots to the middle too.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.410
Since these pivots are sorted, we know
that everything else is sorted, so

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.700
we're done really quickly.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.340
Here, because we're cutting
the array in half every time,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.670
it'll end up looking
a lot like merge sort.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.970
So again,
that's why are efficiency is at log n.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.300
The average case is actually
going to look a lot like this.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.550
We'll pick a random number, it'll move
close to the middle and so on and so on.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.289
However, if we know we're going to be
getting a raise that are near sorted.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.900
We don't want to use Quick Sort,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.350
since that will end up being
the worse case every time.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.489
The second point is that you can do
some optimizations with Quick Sort

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.520
that will make it run faster.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.330
For example, when you split your array,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.630
you can configure your program such that
it runs both halves at the same time.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.200
It will end up using the same
amount of computing power, but

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.950
it will eat up less time.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.490
Also, rather than selecting
the last element as a pivot.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.300
You could look at
the last few elements and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.350
select the median of them as the pivot.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.700
Selecting the median will give
you a better sense of what's in

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.760
the middle of the array overall.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.179
So, you have a better chance of
moving your element in the middle and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.520
having that best case scenario.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.260
Also this version of
Quick Sort is in place, so

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.690
we aren't using any extra space.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.530
Our space complexity is constant.
