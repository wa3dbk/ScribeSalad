00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through it together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We need to make a new environment, and the parent pointer of that new environment

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
should point to the environment the function was declared in.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is tricky, and it's easy to get this wrong.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Don't use the environment we already have lying around;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
use the one we got out of the function. Currently it's empty.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There is nothing in our mapping.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So our next step is to evaluate the actual arguments and make room for them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The actual arguments may be as simple as the number 2,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or they may be complicated mathematical expressions.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We will go over each one in turn, and for that particular argument

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we will evaluate it in the current environment.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Not in the function declaration environment; in the current one.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We haven't really made this new one yet.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And now we'll add to our environment.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This line was particularly tricky because it requires you to remember

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
what our environment really is.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's a tuple with 2 parts: a parent pointer and a dictionary.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We want to get out the oneth part, the dictionary,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and extend it so that when it refers to the ith formal parameter,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that binds to the value of the ith actual argument.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So in our example up here with calling the function square root on 2,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the parameter name is x, the actual argument value is the number 2.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
X is now bound to 2.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
fparams[i]] is the variable name x,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
argval is the number 2.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That's actually it for our new environment,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so now we just want to evaluate the body in that environment.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
One line suffices.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Remember that much like the if-then-else statement we've seen before

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
with the curly braces in JavaScript, a function body may have many statements,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
so we'll use our eval-stmts procedure on the body in the new environment.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This is critical. We don't want to use any of the old environments.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We need the new ones where the formal parameters are bound to the actual arguments.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And that's it.
