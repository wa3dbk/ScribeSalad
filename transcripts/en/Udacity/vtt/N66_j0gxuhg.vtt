00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.150
A data frame is a particularly good data
structure to represent the contents of

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.738
a CSV file.

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:08.360
It's a two-dimensional data
structure with a different type for

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.160
each column, which is often
exactly what you want for a CSV.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.920
Pandas has a function called read_csv,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.910
which takes in the file name of a CSV
file and loads it into a data frame.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.690
I'll use this to load in the New York
subway and weather data.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.860
Since there is a lot of data I don't
want to print out the entire data frame

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.220
like I've done before.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.630
Instead, I'll use the head function to
print out just the first five lines.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.190
The head function returns
a smaller data frame so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.350
the results display just
like a small data frame.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.420
I can also use the describe function to
see some statistics about each column

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.130
like the mean and
the standard deviation.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.960
You got a preview of the read_csv
function at the end of the last lesson.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590
It was used by the starter code
that loaded in the gap minder

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.470
dataset for you.
