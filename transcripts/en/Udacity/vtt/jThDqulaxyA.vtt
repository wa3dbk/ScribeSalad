00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.580
In the olden days, cameras couldn't record glorious color, they only had grey.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.114
And sometimes we want to take a photograph and turn it back into grey to give

00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:12.436
it that old fashioned effect. Now, you might thing that all you'd have to do is

00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:16.520
average the red, green, and blue values. But it's not quite that simple. As it

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.480
turns out, the receptors that we have in our eyes have different sensitivities

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.069
to colors. And what you actually have to do is take the red, green and blue

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:30.422
values weighted by these factors, and then turn them into grey. And then, when

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:33.962
you're done with that, you can set red to these value green and blue, because

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:40.280
they're all the same, that's what makes the color grey. And then, you're done.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.720
But we have the same problem that you just saw. Red, green, blue are integers.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.408
These weighing constants are fractional numbers. So, the whole expression is a

00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:55.539
fractional number. And I want to put it back into an integer. So, the solution

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.831
is again, to inject a cast, put this expression in parentheses and put

00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:06.199
parenthesis int before that. And then, you get it truncated down to the nearest

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:10.338
integer. Once again, I'd like you to try that, so you can see it with your own

00:01:10.338 --> 00:01:15.566
eyes. Go ahead. Again, in the color class, implement a new method. In this

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:19.810
case, it's the turnGray method. Take the red, green and blue values, combine

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.610
them to a gray value using the equation that you just saw. Make sure that you

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.659
get an integer. And then, take that integer and put it back into red, green and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.119
blue. Go ahead and do it now.
