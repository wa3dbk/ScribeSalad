00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's do another one quiz on BTB and BHT interactions.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.076
Again we have the same BHT, 16 entries and perfect. BTB's four entries and

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:12.600
perfect. Same program as before. The question for

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.350
you now is how many times do we access the BTB this time for each instruction?

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.860
So, how many times, when we fetch this instruction, do we access the BTB.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.620
How many times, when you fetch this instruction, do we access the BTB,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.540
and so on. Remember that these two instructions execute only once.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.650
This loop has 100 iterations, so all these instructions execute 100 times,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.570
except for this one, which executes 101 times. The question for you now is,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.850
how many times do we access the BTB for each of those instructions?
