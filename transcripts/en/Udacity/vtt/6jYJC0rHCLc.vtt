00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.480
For now, let's assume everyone's friendly. There are lots of ways to do

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.580
this. And building a robust scale of a web service is challenging. For now,

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.095
what we're just going to do is set up a simple service running

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.820
on our own machine. Depending on how your machine is set up, and your

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.690
internet service provider, you might be able to create a server that other

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.750
people can use that way. But we're not going to get into that now.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.560
If you do want to learn how to build a scalable, robust, externally

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.262
hosted web service. Which I hope many of you will. I would strongly encourage

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:28.796
you to take Steve Huffman's course on Web Application Engineering

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:31.648
which is all about how to do that after you've finished

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:33.942
this course. But, it turns out that setting up a

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:37.662
simple service running on our own machine is surprisingly easy. We're

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:40.328
going to do this by using a tool called web.py. Despite

00:00:40.328 --> 00:00:43.907
being simple and small it's still quite powerful. It was originally

00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:47.970
built as the web application framework to run Reddit. To install

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.620
it all you need to do is use PIP which hopefully

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.710
you have installed from unit nine. If not go back to unit nine

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.240
to see how to install that or follow the links here. And install

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.000
it like this and now we have the web module available to test

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.599
in Python. Next I'm going to go a little bit backwards from what

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.870
we usually do. I'm going to show you all the code that we

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.850
need to get our search engine running as a web application and then

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.820
I'll explain some parts of it. But I think you can figure out

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.610
a lot yourself and please try and do that. So here's all the code.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.020
We're importing web.py. If you have the search engine

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.395
code and you download this code, and you've installed the

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:25.160
web.py module, you should be able to try this yourself

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.170
and see that it actually is running a web service

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.230
on your own machine. This code is in a

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.130
file we'll call server.py. Then we construct the web server

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.940
in a terminal by running python server.py, and we'll see

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.460
that it prints out that it's listening on port 8080.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.910
And it's still running. Note that we haven't got a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.050
new terminal prompt yet. So let's try using a web

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.070
browser, to see what it's doing. And here, you can

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.640
use any browser you want; we'll use the Firefox browser.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.462
And we're going to make a request to the localhost.

00:01:56.462 --> 00:01:58.854
So we'll make a request to our local server, we

00:01:58.854 --> 00:02:02.020
can get to the localhost by doing all zeroes or

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.600
we could do localhost. And the port number, 8080. And we

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.940
send a request. We can see the server

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.040
printed out a message, told us something happened. And

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.260
that's done by the web.py code. It's telling us

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.050
that we got a request. And we got a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.505
response none. We could do a more interesting request. This time I'll use

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:28.350
localhost. And after the server and port.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.500
We can put the key word wer'e searching for. So let's search for hummus. And now

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.530
we actually see the response from our lucky search. This

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.390
is the response we get for hummus. If we try

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.050
another keyword that doesn't exist in our index and we

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.550
get none. You can see in the log, the two

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.380
requests that came in and one was a get for

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.130
hummus. One was get for wisdom. So if you've got

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.580
that working, you're running a web server. You're running a

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.520
web application that responds to queries. We're not going to

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.650
deal with the complexities of making a nice form and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.760
providing a pretty output in this class but you've got

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.700
the basic functionality of a web server up and running

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.600
and you can do searches by putting them in the URL.
