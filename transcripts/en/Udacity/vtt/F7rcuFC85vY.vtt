00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.080
So today we've talked about version spaces. Version spaces are an algorithm for

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.560
converging onto an understanding of a concept, even in the absence of prior

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.180
background knowledge or an intelligent teacher. We covered the algorithm for

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.790
version spaces, where we iteratively refine a general and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.750
specific model of a concept, until they converge down onto one another.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.500
We then talked about using version spaces to address more complex problems.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.700
We've also connected version spaces to older concepts, like incremental concept

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.170
learning. Finally we talked about the limitations of version spaces,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.930
such as what to do if there's no single correct concept, or what to do in

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.010
the absence of either positive or negative examples. To address these, we also

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.915
covered identification trees, which are a different ways of approaching the same

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:42.080
kind of data that version spaces operate on. We'll touch on version spaces and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.000
incremental concept learning again, when we talk about mistake based learning.
