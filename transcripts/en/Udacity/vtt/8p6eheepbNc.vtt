00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.860
In this lesson, we'll use Microsoft's
HealthVault, but there are several

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.560
widely used personal health records,
and they mostly do the same things.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.420
You should already have a HealthVault
account, but we haven't yet

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.700
explored it to see how it
stores clinical data and

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.840
what it can do to help patients use that
data, including sharing it with others.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.330
So here's an example of my health
data I manually input in HealthVault.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.350
You can see key data such
as patient allergies,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.950
immunizations, conditions,
and lab test results.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.890
As shown here, users are assisted in
inputting complex information such as

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.550
their condition by smart lists
that pop up as they type.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.700
More recently, as meaningful
use has dictated the export

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.650
of at least standardized
clinical summaries,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.876
the burden on the patient to record
all their data is largely alleviated.

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:57.270
And the PHR can and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.680
should import these summaries from all
providers caring for that patient.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.840
Note here that I have a direct email
address provided to me by HealthVault

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.090
to help facilitate that.
