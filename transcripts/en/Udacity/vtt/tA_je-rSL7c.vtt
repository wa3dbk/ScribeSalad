The file we'll be working with in this lesson and

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.119
the next, has actually been enriched with some geographic information.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.840
The important columns added here, are a latitude and a longitude,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.220
a home column, which represents the team of the home hosting country.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.100
And then many of the other columns, which we previously worked with.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.810
Including, the attendance of each game, and the year in which the game was held.
