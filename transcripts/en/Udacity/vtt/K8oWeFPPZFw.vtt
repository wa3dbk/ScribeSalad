00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.590
There's one more useful aspect about declaring variables, namely comments. Have

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.030
a look at this variable declaration, we have a travelTime of 228 days. When you

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.390
read it you probably ask yourself, for which trip? Now I can tell you for which

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.880
trip, but when you write code it's very common that you look at your code

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.210
months or years later, or someone else looks at the code. And then they would

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.840
really like to know more of an explanation. In Java, we use comments to give

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.360
such an explanation. Notice, these 2 slashes, they are the comment marker.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.410
Anything that's after the slashes is ignored by the compiler. It's just there

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.930
for humans. To understand the code. You can write anything at all after the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.190
comment marks, and the compiler won't care. But o course, if you write nonsense

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.355
like this, the humans who read your code may hate you. Comments are for humans.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:03.790
Use a comment whenever you need to explain something that might be difficult to

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.010
understand for the human reader.
