00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.594
So we're in great shape. We have an expression for x. But are we really done

00:00:04.594 --> 00:00:08.028
yet? I don't think so. We know that what we have over here is actually just

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:12.680
equal to a number, but what number is it? Since we can't rewrite 121 off the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.515
top of our heads, as a power of 4, we going to need to do a little bit of work

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:22.788
here. What property of logs do you think we need to use to find out the value

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:28.536
of log base 4 of 121? Should we use the product property, the quotient

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:34.280
property, the power property, or the change of base property? Think about

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.099
what's keeping us right now from evaluating this side of our equation.
