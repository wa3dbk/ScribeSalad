00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.019
When you think about ways to describe yourself, Lauren, what do you think about?

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.500
&gt;&gt; Well, there's physical traits, like, you know, height or body shape, and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.630
then, well, there's personality traits like extroversion

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.560
or introversion, and then there's my interests,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
so like music or art. So there are many features we could use

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.240
to describe an individual, and we call

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.000
these traits. Traits are any distinguishing feature

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.080
of an individual. For example, Lauren, if you had

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.500
to describe yourself in three traits, what would you say?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.520
&gt;&gt; well, I have light hair. I'm outgoing. And I'm really into psychology.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. I think I would say that I'm tall, I'm pretty friendly,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.070
outgoing as well, and I'm a huge lover of the Zelda series of video

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.030
games from Nintendo.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.990
&gt;&gt; So, are you saying that all of our traits

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.760
come from our genome? Well to a certain extent we're

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.050
saying that all of these attributes are traits, but the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.510
extent to which they're influenced by our genome is variable.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.310
&gt;&gt; Okay, because I was going to say, things like

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.720
my personal interests I don't think come from the genome.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.950
&gt;&gt; Sure. I mean things like height are, are

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.939
things that we suspect would have a major genetic component.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.840
whereas my general love of video games, probably

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.750
has less to do with my genetics, and a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.170
lot more to do with my environment. For our

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.210
purposes in this course, we'll use three main categorizations

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.450
for traits. We'll have physical vs. behavioral traits,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.620
visible vs. hidden traits. An innate versus learned traits.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.400
So let's see if you can classify height for

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.010
each of this categories. Is it physical or behavioral?

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.860
Is it visible or is it hidden? Or is it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.100
innate or is it learned? Check out the boxes that apply.
