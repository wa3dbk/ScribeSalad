00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.872
The first property states that if we add 2 logarithm's together that have the

00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:09.250
same base then we can just multiply the numbers together. For example if we

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.180
have log base 2 of 4 plus log base 2 of 8 then we know that equals log base 2

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:21.746
of 4 times times, which equals 32. Now, this statement should make sense. We

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:27.940
know that log 2 of 4 equals 2. And we know that log base two of 8 equals three.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.795
So if we add those together, we should get 5. And sure enough, the log base 2

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:39.328
of 32 equals 5. So whenever you add logarithms that have the same base, you can

00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:44.630
really just multiply these arguments together. We just multiply x times y and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.070
then take the log of it. So let's see if you can extend this reasoning. If we

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.060
have log base b of j, plus log base b of a, plus log base b of m, what would

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.655
that equal, if we did the log base b of this expression? In other words what

00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:04.135
expression goes right here so that way the right-hand side of our equation is

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:08.490
equal to the left-hand side of our equation.
