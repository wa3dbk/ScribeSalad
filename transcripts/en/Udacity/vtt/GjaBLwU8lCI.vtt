00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.343
Our first step is going to be to calculate m, the amount of money that Grant

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:08.542
spends each month. Here are the two important pieces of information that we got

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:13.042
from the question. We can replace fixed costs with 20,000. Since we know that

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:17.692
each wiper set costs $10 to make, and Grant makes n wiper sets, going to have

00:00:17.692 --> 00:00:22.867
20,000 plus 10n equaling m. That means we can now take this quantity and replace

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:27.807
it in the spot of m in our equation for p. Since we're subtracting m, we need to

00:00:27.807 --> 00:00:32.958
make sure that we're subtracting this entire quantity, both terms. This looks

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.795
pretty good right now, but remember you want to replace n here. With the

00:00:37.795 --> 00:00:43.675
expression that we found in terms of c which was just negative 200c plus 18,000.

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:49.444
Now, we can finally go through and simplify our equation. This gives us a final

00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:54.925
equation for p of, miraculously, negative 200c squared plus 20,000c minus

00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:55.649
200,000.
