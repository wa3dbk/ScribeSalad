00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, well that sounds great, so far.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We have an idea of when we can possibly remove things

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
based on mathematical truths.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But how do we actually implement them

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in our JavaScript interpretor--in our web browser?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, step 1 is to think of a big library of optimizations.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For example, X times 1 is always equal to X,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and X+0 is always equal to X.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So if I see one of these expressions,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I could just replace it with the simpler one on the right.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I'm going to do that by transforming the parse tree directly.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But before we talk about transforming the parse tree,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we're going to need to be certain about what sort of optimizations we want.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Remember, we can only do optimizations that don't change the meaning of the program.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We have to get the same answer, just in less time.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So here I'm going to have you take a look and evaluate

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or tell me about some candidate optimizations.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I want you to fill in each of these 4 blanks. [X1==&lt;u&gt;_] [X&lt;/u&gt;0==_] [X*2==&lt;u&gt;_] [X/X==_&lt;/u&gt;]

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Write the simplest expression you can to make the equality true.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So can I replace X times 1 with something simple that fits in this box?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Write the simplest expression you can

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that retains the meaning in all cases.

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.999
This is a little trickier than it looks, so try it out.
