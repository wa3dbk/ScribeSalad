00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.120
So now, we know the toolbox provided

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.500
by SPIN for building an operating system. Now,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.410
one can build each of the services we talked about early on, that an operating

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.340
system should provide. Such as memory management,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.990
CPU scheduling, threads, file system, network protocol stack,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.090
and so on, from scratch, as extensions

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.740
to SPIN. As we know, memory management and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.360
CPU scheduling are core services that

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.610
any operating system should provide. However,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.050
an extensible operating system should not

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.720
dictate how these services should be implemented.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.395
SPIN provides interface procedures for implementing

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:44.720
these services in the operating system.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.020
Physical memory is a precious resource.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.990
We know that native operating systems such

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:58.720
as Linux or Windows manages the physical memory that is available from the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.450
hardware. SPIN wants to allow extensions to manage physical memory allocated to

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.970
them in whatever fashion they choose to. The macro-allocation of a bunch

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.140
of physical memory to an extension, it's outside the scope of this discussion.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.528
But, assume that the allocation of a bunch of physical memory happens when an

00:01:21.528 --> 00:01:26.950
extension's charged up. The discussion in this tablet frame is to do with the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.630
management of the pre-allocated physical memory by

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.890
the extension. The interface functions that I'm

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.073
showing you here from memory management are

00:01:36.073 --> 00:01:40.430
simply header files provided by SPIN. For example,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.590
allocating a page frame. Deallocating a page frame. Reclaiming

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.410
a page frame. Similarly, allocating a virtual page or

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.000
deallocating a virtual page which might be used for dynamic memory allocation.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.050
Translating, has to do with creating and destroying address

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.840
spaces, adding or removing mapping between virtual

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.780
pages, and physical frames. All of those

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.580
are interface functions, that are provided as header

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.760
files by SPIN. And memory management, because of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.160
what we said earlier about overcommitment of memory.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.690
Not all of a processor's address space

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.820
is going to be fitting in physical memory.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.640
So, there are event handlers, that are provided

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.370
as part of the core service of SPIN

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.280
for handling page fault, access fault, meaning, if you had

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.820
a page that is write protected and if a process tries to write to it, that's an

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.150
access violation. Or, if a process is trying to access a region of

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.510
memory that it doesn't have access to, generating a bad

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.970
address exception. All of these are interface functions that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.020
are defined as core services of memory

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.290
management in the SPIN operation system. It

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.760
is not saying anything about how these

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.280
services are implemented, but it is giving you

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.090
just a header file. The implementer of an extension has to write the actual

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.590
code for these header functions and create

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.100
a logical protection domain that corresponds to physical

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.060
address management, virtual address management, translation

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.210
management, and the handler functions for

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.270
dealing with these different types of

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.100
events. Once the logical protection domain is

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.270
dynamically instantiated, it becomes an extension

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.870
of SPIN, and after that there's

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.920
no border crossing between a particular

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.770
service that has been so instantiated and

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.720
SPIN itself. And all of these

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.530
functions are invoked automatically when the hardware

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.220
events occur, corresponding to a page fault or access violation fault and so on.
