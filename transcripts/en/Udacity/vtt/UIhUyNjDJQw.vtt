00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.210
So now I would like to wrap up this lesson

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.720
by going back to our discussion of rational unified process

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.630
phases and iterations. So to do that I'm going to bring

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.480
back the presentation that I used before, the summary representation

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.840
about phases and traditional software engineering activities. And I want to

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.720
use this representation to stress and discuss a couple of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.140
things. Mainly I want to recap it because I think

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.480
it is very important. What is the relation between the rational

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.270
unified process, and the traditional software engineering phases, and software

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.540
engineering activities? And I like to do it now that

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.648
we have discussed the phases in a little more detail.

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:35.920
So I want to make sure that it is clear by now

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.660
how and when the traditional software engineering activities, the ones

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.620
listed here, take place in the context of the RUP

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.850
phases, the four listed up here. For instance, it should

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.410
be clear why implementation takes place mainly in the construction phase.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.140
Why requirements engineering is prominent in the elaboration phase

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.290
and why deployment activities occur mostly in the transition phase,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.120
and so on. So it should be clear now

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.930
why the activities are so distributed in the four phases.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.130
It should also be clear that although there is

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.350
normally one main phase for each activity, the activities really

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.550
span multiple phases. Which is actually one of the interesting

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.580
aspect of RUP. So the fact that you're not really

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.700
done with an activity even in later phases. Why? Well, because that allows

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.070
you, in subsequent iterations, to address

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.370
problems that came up in previous iterations.
