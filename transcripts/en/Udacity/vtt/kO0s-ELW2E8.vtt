00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.930
I've started out by factoring the left hands side. That gives us x minus 5

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:12.150
times x plus 4 equals 0. That means that x equals 5 or x equals negative 4. So,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.123
these should be the solutions to the original equation we started out with.
