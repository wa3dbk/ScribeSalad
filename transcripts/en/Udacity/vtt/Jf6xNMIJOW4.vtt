00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.110
So let's start with
Net Margins this time.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.520
Its the percentage of revenue
retained minus all expenses.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.580
So the correct answer is B here.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.770
You calculate Net Margin as follows.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.760
Take the total Net Profit, divide it by
your total revenue and multiply by 100.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.070
Gross margin is calculated as follows.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.870
Take your gross profit, divide it by
your total revenue, and multiply by 100.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.229
Now both metrics give us an indication
on our quality of performance.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:38.570
Many companies tell you that we have
a 40% gross margin on our products.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.560
So it can change from sector to sector,
but

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.770
you can always measure yourself
against other similar companies.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.620
And see how well or not well
you're doing in relation to them.
