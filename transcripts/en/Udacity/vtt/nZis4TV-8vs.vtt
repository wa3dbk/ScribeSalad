00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.660
So far so good, but we need to
figure out a couple of things.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.170
Mainly dealing with sending the audio
to our second view controller,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.150
which you're about to build.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.100
If we think about this,
we have two problems on hand.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.770
The first is we need a way
to pass the audio file

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.370
from the first view controller to the
second one, so it can be played back.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.990
The second issue that we have, is what
happens when we record a large file and

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.060
transition before it has been
written out to flash storage.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.630
In other words, we need to only
move from the first view controller

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.430
to the second view controller, once AV
audio recorder has finished writing out

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.660
the recorded voice, that way file.
