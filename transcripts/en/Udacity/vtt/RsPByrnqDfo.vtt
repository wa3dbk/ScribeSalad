00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.650
So let's look at a real example of a hierarchical predictor.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.710
We will look at Intel's Pentium M processor which has these predictors.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.310
First it has a cheap predictor that contains just two bit counters.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.440
Then it has a local history predictor and a global history predictor.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.900
So what the processor is doing is it has a large array of two bit counters,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.320
a local history predictor that stores the local history for

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.830
each branch, and an array of two bit counters for different histories. And

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.290
the global history predictor with the global history that is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.790
longer than the local history is here. And also, an array of counters for

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.340
that predictor. So, if we try to predict a single branch, what we would do is,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.540
we would look up the PC for the branch in the two bit counter array.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.280
We would also try to look up the local predictor and

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.880
the global predictor prediction. And then, we form the actual prediction for

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.050
the processor by using the result of the global predictor if the global

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.690
predictor says that the branch is predicted here. And for that, what we do is we

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.030
keep another array here that is just saying whether this branch, so this is kind

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.840
of a like a tag array that says whether this branch is going to be predicted by

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.570
the global predictor. If the global predictor does not have a matching tag,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.240
that means that this branch was not inserted in the global predictor,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.520
in which case we shouldn't use it. If that happens, we will use the prediction

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.870
from the local predictor, which will also have a dagger A that

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.190
says whether this predictor should be predicted by the local predictor, and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.460
if so then we use that. Otherwise, if the branch is not in the local predictor,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.430
we just use the result of the two bit counter. When we update the predictor,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.730
however, what we do is we update the two bit counter.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.680
If we have the branch in the local predictor, we update the local predictor.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.670
If we have the branch in the global predictor, we update the global predictor.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.600
But then what happens is if we are using the two bit counter and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.800
the branch is not in the local predictor, then what we do is if the two bit

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.030
counter is mispredicting the branch, we insert it into the local predictor. So

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.400
now the branch will be present here next time.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.480
If the local predictor is not giving us good prediction for this branch, then we

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.060
insert the branch into the global predictors. So what's going to happen is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.860
pretty much branches that are almost perfectly predictable by two bit counters,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.800
and that's a lot of branches. For example every, always taken branch or

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.400
branch that is dominantly taken is going to be mostly predicted by the two

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.820
bit predictor. So we never even consult the local and global predictors. And

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.780
that save space in this predictors for other branches that need them.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.460
Saving space means that we can have fewer of the two bit entries and

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.920
the history entries than we would otherwise need if we were trying to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.260
predict all the branches with the local or

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.400
even the global predictor. So how do we say whether the branch is present or

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.150
not? Well, what we really do is we insert some bits of the branches address

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.420
into the corresponding line of the predictor. So the history,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.430
entry here we will index with some bits of the PC to find the history.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.690
And in that same entry we will also insert some of the upper bits of the PC, so

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.240
that different branches that map to this entry only one of them gets to be

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.420
predicted by this entry. The rest of them say that they're not found here.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.490
So the idea is that if most of the branches that end up

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.360
mapping to this entry are really predictable by the two bit predictor,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.180
then we don't really need to use this entry for those branches.
