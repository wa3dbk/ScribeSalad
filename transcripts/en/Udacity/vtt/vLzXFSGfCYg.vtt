00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.969
The alpha beta model is messy,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.970
especially if you compare it to
the dynamic multi-threading model,

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.960
which you might use on a shared
memory multi course setting.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.440
But, the basic argument for message
passing is that you need to get your

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.870
hands dirty if you want to be
efficient at large scales.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.160
And that's the big idea of this lesson.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.780
How to think about efficiency,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.590
specifically in terms of
computation versus communication.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.710
Now, the message passing model also
has at least one major weakness.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.130
It forces you to think about
a lot of thinks like who and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.550
how many processes there are, when and

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.299
how those processes communicate, as well
as how are the processes are connected.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.830
So an interesting and
largely open research question is,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.570
are there efficient algorithms
that are network oblivious?

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.260
That is, is there a framework for
writing and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.460
analyzing algorithms that will be
efficient independent of the network.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.951
I wonder.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:57.110
