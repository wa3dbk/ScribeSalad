00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This function that describes how the coefficient of friction depends on the wheel slip

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is a vital part of the simulation.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The tricky thing about is that it stems from experiments. It contains empirical data.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We do not have any nice equation for that curve--that is not until now.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
One way to deliver such empirical data in this simulation would be

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to use a lookup table such as this one.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If we input a wheel slip of zero, we output a coefficient of friction that's zero as well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If we input a wheel slip of 0.1, we output a coefficient of friction that's 0.9 and so on.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This would constitute a lookup table.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The tricky thing is what would you do for a wheel slip of say 0.01234.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What do you do about values of s that are not contained in this column?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We have to somehow interpolate these values, which gets complex

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and it's not easy to do in a smooth fashion.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
A simple approach is to use a phenomenological equation to guess how one could

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
possibly describe this in mathematics without worrying about the reasons for

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
why it looks the way it looks.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We just collect some mathematical functions that produce the right shape.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If you look at the shape of this function, you may come up with the following idea--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
for reasonably large values of s, this function almost is a line so why not use that line

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
as one component in our equation.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Close to zero it looks as though we are subtracting

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
a quickly decaying function such as e^(-20s).

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Your job is now to make this work.

00:01:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Pick the right value for the constant a and then implement this function in Python.
