00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.240
One physical phenomenon that is sometimes factored into the illumination model

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.355
is described by the Fresnel equations. These equations were discovered by the

00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:11.360
French engineer and physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel. He received little

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.010
recognition of his work in optics while he was alive. Much of it was published

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.642
after his death in 1827. Happily, what evidently gave him the most pleasure was

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:22.385
the discovery and experimental confirmation of his scientific theory. The

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:25.175
Fresnel equations themselves have to do with the amount of reflection and

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:29.004
refraction off a surface. The basic relationship is this, the more on edge you

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.826
look on a surface, the reflective it is. If the surface is refractive, in other

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:35.707
words transparent, the amount of light transmitted will drop off considerably

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:40.350
as you approach the shallow angle. My favorite example is a lake or the ocean.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.038
The next time you're in shallow water, notice that you can look straight down

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:46.622
and see the bottom. As you look out towards the horizon, the angle of your eye

00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:50.828
to the surface's normal approaches 90 degrees and reflection will dominate. For

00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:54.430
materials that aren't transparent, this effect still takes place. The Fresnel

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.730
effect is particularly noticeable for what are called dielectrics, which is a

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.852
fancy way of saying insulators. In other words, material such as glass,

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:06.075
plastic, and clay. For example, glass is about 25 times as reflective at a

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:09.930
shallow angle than directly head-on. An experiment you can do right now to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.602
prove this to yourself. Take a sheet of normal paper, nothing very shiny or

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:17.636
rough, and put it on a flat surface such as a book. Hold the paper so that

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:21.740
you're hold it nearly edge on and look towards a lit area, such as a window.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.939
Here I'm using the tablet. At nearly 90 degrees to the surface, normally you

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.800
will see the paper become quite reflective. In fact, the Fresnel effect should

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.414
also lessen the diffuse contribution. As the object becomes more reflective in

00:01:32.414 --> 00:01:36.627
real life, there are less photons left to go off in other directions. There is

00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:39.910
one implementation detail I want to mention. You should use the normal that

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.863
represents the mirror orientation. For example, for a mirror reflective

00:01:42.863 --> 00:01:46.870
surface, this is simply the shading normal. For most other materials, it's not.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.185
With the Blinn-Phong illumination equation, the idea is that the material is

00:01:50.185 --> 00:01:54.526
made of microfacets. Only a few facets are angled just right to reflect light

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:58.200
towards the eye. These facets have normal vectors pointing exactly halfway

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.362
between the light and eye vectors. Recall that the special direction is called

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:05.823
the half-angle vector. Happily, this is a vector we compute anyway for specular

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:08.280
highlighting, but it's important to use this direction and not the shading

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.154
normal. Try the demo to get a sense of the effect. Notice how a nearly edge on

00:02:13.154 --> 00:02:15.472
angle causes the reflectivity to increase.
