00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.787
The answer is less than 0.05. Here's how we know that. Remember, we did a 5%

00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:11.282
test. Alpha equals 0.05. That means that this area beyond here. Is 5% of the

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:14.554
distribution. Remember, the critical value cuts off the lower 5% of the

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:21.860
distribution. The p value is this area, right here, cut off by our value of t.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.760
So remember, a p value is just a proportion of scores that fall beyond a score.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.548
So in this case, the one-tailed p value has to smaller than 0.5, because this

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:38.440
small chunk here is smaller than this chunk right here. So, p has to be less

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.315
than 0.5. Now again, when we're doing these by hand, we don't know the exact p

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:45.829
value But we can use a calculator to look it up. I'll do that right now for

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.144
you. The exact one tailed p value is 0.00985. You can clearly see that this is

00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:58.086
much less than 0.05. So p is less than 0.05. We would probably present this p

00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:03.700
value if we were writing this out in the result section. As p is equal to 0.01.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.103
That's because we round to two decimal places.
