00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem we're going to look at the naive multiplication algorithm from lecture.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's say we're computing naive( 63, 12).

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
At some point in the executionâ€”so we'll pause hereâ€”

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we'll have x = 20 and y = 12.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The question is, what is z?
