00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.257
Our first term right here only has one variable in it, x. And the power that x

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:08.320
is taken to is 4. So that means that the degree of this term is 4. This is a

00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:12.430
fourth degree term. Now this next one is a little bit tricky. 100 is just a

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:16.820
constant term. It doesn't have any variable factors in it. Or in other words, it

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:22.783
has zero variable factors. So this means that it's degree is 0. This is true of

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:29.073
any constant term. If we had the number say, 78 here instead, or negative 432 or

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:34.853
19.3 any constant term, no matter what it's value is has degree 0. So that means

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:40.466
1/2 over here which is also a constant term has a degree of 0. So another way to

00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:45.602
think of this is that if we desperately wanted to have a variable in a constant

00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:50.541
term, we didn't want to change the value of the term, what power would that

00:00:50.553 --> 00:00:55.555
variable need to be taken to? So let's say we have 1/2 here and we want an x in

00:00:55.567 --> 00:01:00.594
that term. In order to keep this term equal to 1/2 we need to have x be to the 0

00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:05.319
power since Any thing, any variable, any constant to the 0 power equals 1. That

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:10.259
means we would actually have 1/2 times 1, which is just equal to 1/2. But even

00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:14.652
if we choose to write the term in this way with a variable involved the power of

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:18.785
that variable is 0. So this is still a 0 degree term For this next term y we

00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:22.867
need to remember that any variable that doesn't have an exponent written

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:28.158
explicitly actually has an invisible 1. As its power. So this term has a degree

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.260
of 1. It's a first degree term. And lastly we have x squared, y squared, z

00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:38.153
cubed.. So the degree of this term is just going to be 2 plus 2 plus 3, which is

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:38.852
equal to 7.
