00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.072
Because of scenarios like this, Python provides an extra construct that can be

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:08.271
used as part of the try statement. It's called the Finally clause. And the way

00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:11.634
it works is, the code in the Finally Block is guaranteed to always run

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:15.351
regardless of whether the try block finishes, or we go through an exception

00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:19.554
handler. So, it could work like this. We could run the try block, if we complete

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:23.910
normally, it will go to the Finally Block, run the finally block, and then we're

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.680
done. And note that even if there's something that changes control flow in here,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.220
suppose there's a return and we're inside a function definition. If that's in

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.048
the middle of the Block here, normally you would think, well, when we return, we

00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:40.768
return, no other code runs. If we've got a Finally, that's not the case. The

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:45.860
Finally code will run before the return happens. If there's an exception before

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.435
we get to that, let's say, there's an exception in the try and it goes to the

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:55.535
exception handler, well, that'll run, we're still guaranteed to run the Finally

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:59.260
code. So, this is a construct that leads to lots of complex control flow.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.494
Execution can jump unexpectedly. Well, unexpectedly if you don't know what to

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:06.502
expect. Hopefully, you know what to expect because you've been paying attention.

00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:10.732
But execution can jump around in all sorts of strange ways, but it guarantees

00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:15.050
that this Finally code, which cleans up if something failed always runs. So,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.898
this almost works. So, we've added our Finally clause and inside the Finally

00:01:19.898 --> 00:01:24.623
clause, we're closing the file and because of the semantics of the Finally,

00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:29.423
whether we succeed in writing or we go to the exception, we'll eventually run

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:33.266
this close and we only need it in one place. So, this almost works but not

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:37.350
quite. Let me show you what happens. So, I'm going to try running it. And I'm

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.062
running it in a directory where the blim.py file is not writable. And here's

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:47.248
what happens. I get the error, so I'm catching the exception, printing Error

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:52.726
writing file, permission is denied, but now, when I try to do fout.close, as you

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:57.540
can see here, I get a name error and I get an error because since the open

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.018
didn't succeed, fout was never defined, and we get a name error because the name

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:04.435
fout is not defined.
