You know sometimes things just don't work right.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.880
A request might fail for a number of reasons.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.410
Maybe this server is down, maybe the networking is having issues.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.710
Or maybe your request was just simply written poorly.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.490
You know what?

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.850
Let's think about that last case an incorrectly written AJAX request.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.310
Head into your script.js file and mess up the Wikipedia string here.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.700
I'll do it by simply typing ASDF over and

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.940
over until we don't have a website anymore.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.210
Load up your website and search for you know, an address.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.310
But keep this messed up Wikipedia string here.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.090
Then open up devtools and start poking around.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.140
So for this quiz go ahead and ruin the URL string for the Wikipedia endpoint.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.100
Open up devtools and figure out what related error messages you're seeing.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.250
Specifically, I want to know what is showing up in all caps.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.040
Type your answer in here.
