00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.740
In many cases quicksort is one of
the most efficient sorting algorithms.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.830
To do a quicksort you essentially
pick one of the values in

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.390
the array at random.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.129
Move all values larger than it above it
and all values below it, lower than it.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.230
The value that you pick
initially is called a pivot.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.170
You continue on recursively, picking a
pivot in the upper and lower sections of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.660
the array, sorting them similarly
until the whole array is sorted.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.100
Okay, let's watch this in action.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.580
First we need to select a pivot.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.320
The convention is to pick
the last element as your pivot.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.489
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.890
Our first element is
larger than our pivot.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.850
So we need to move it behind the pivot.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.000
However, we're doing an in-place sort.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.240
So we need to move the element in
front of the pivot to make room.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.230
So in this step we're
moving 8 to the last block,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.870
2 to the second to last block, and
10 all the way up to the first block.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.566
This seems a little counterintuitive.

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:07.500
You would think that we would
move 10 back and not forward.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.960
Just hold on for now,
we'll see exactly why this works soon.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.190
So we did our shift and
now we can make another comparison.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.107
Now we get to take a look at 10.

00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:21.380
Since 10 is bigger than 2 we need to,
again, move 10 back.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.330
Move 2 up and move whatever's
in front of 2 up as well.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.649
Great, one more swap down.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.679
Finally, we have 0 at
the front of our array,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.670
which is actually smaller
than our pivot of 2.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.510
That's pretty great, but now we
just move to the second element and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.760
do the same process with that one.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.380
Since 3 is greater than 2 we'll need
to shift around everything again.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.259
Awesome, this is looking so much better.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.270
Since 7 is still bigger than 2, we
need to do another comparison, though.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.900
Here's the swap we need to make.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.740
And this is what our
array looks like now.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.745
This is definitely good.

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:00.110
2 is in the right place.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.440
We've checked all the elements before
it and we're sure they're less than it.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.270
And we've put all of these elements
after it that are all definitely

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.289
bigger than it.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.699
Because we're sure everything
in the array below 2

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.680
is actually less than 2 and
everything above 2 is greater than 2,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.500
we know that 2 is in
the exact right place.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.800
I'm going to color code it so we know
that we don't need to move it again.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.150
At this point we normally
do the same process for

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.100
everything smaller than the pivot and
everything bigger than the pivot.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.690
Let's start with the smaller part first.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.940
We select our pivot and
compare to everything before.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.870
Since 0 is actually less than 1,
there's nothing we need to do.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.360
And with just one comparison,

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.300
we know that both of these are in
the right place and we can move on.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.910
Now in the second half of the array,
we select a pivot.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.399
Since 7 and 3 are both smaller than
the pivot, we won't need to move them.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.390
However, 8 is bigger than the pivot.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.660
So we'll need to do a swap here.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.487
Now that our swap's complete
we can see that 8 and

00:02:58.487 --> 00:03:01.970
10 are actually in their
eventual positions.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.179
Everything less than 8 was already below
8 so we didn't need to move it at all.

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:11.260
Okay, now we only have two elements
left that maybe need to be sorted.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.980
Again, all we have to do here is
assign 3 as a pivot and compare.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.109
We'll see that these two
need to be switched.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.200
Do that quickly and
then our whole array is done.
