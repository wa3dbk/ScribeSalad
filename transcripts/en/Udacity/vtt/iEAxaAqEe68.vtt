00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
How can you deal with an NP complete problem other than avoiding it.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.590
Well, I think you should think of yourself as kind of a lawyer who has to work with the

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.470
laws of NP completeness and the main law of NP completeness is this, unless P=NP,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.940
there will be no polynomial time algorithm for your NP complete problems.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.590
Now, what do good lawyers do with the law.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.910
They find loopholes and that is exactly what we are going to do for this law of NP completeness,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.040
and we're actually be looking at two loopholes.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.530
The loophole that we will be exploring in this unit is using intelligent exponential time algorithms.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.320
We're going to work in exponential time but we're going to do it in a smart way.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.240
We're going to avoid things like 2^n or 3^n, but rather we're going to have algorithm set

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.240
for example I have something like 1.3^n, which is already much better

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.120
and works for many practical cases.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.600
What we are then going to look at in the next units is what I like to call sloppy solutions.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.310
For all proofs of NP completeness, we always require the computer

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.670
to provide the exact answer to our problem.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.800
One chance to circumvent NP completeness might be to say,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.570
"Well, we do not want the best possible solution, but we're happy with say

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.490
one that is close to optimal" or for a decision problem for example, we might be saying,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.250
"Well, it's okay if we get the right answer in about 80% of the time."

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.360
For each of these approaches, we will discuss the main ideas and also of course,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.530
give you some examples to make them more clear and talk a bit about the theory

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.170
behind these approaches because these are techniques where you really have

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.300
to understand the theory if you want to be successful in practice.

00:01:39.300 --> 99:59:59.000
So let's start out with smart exponential time algorithms.
