00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.505
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The answer here is y equals negative 3 halves x plus 7 halves. Now remember,

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:09.486
just because you see fractions, doesn't mean it's wrong. Let's see how we got

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:14.505
that answer. Again, this is a two-part question. First, we have to find the

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.955
slope. And then, we have to find the equation. So, first, let's find the slope.

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:26.387
I know the equation of slope is y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1. I'm going to go

00:00:26.387 --> 00:00:34.126
ahead and label my points, this is x1, y1 and this is x2, y2. Again, this helps

00:00:34.126 --> 00:00:41.904
me make sure I put the numbers in the right places. So, the slope y2 is negative

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:49.224
1 minus y1, which is 2, over x2, which is 3 minus x1, which is 1. So, we have

00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:56.167
negative 1 minus 2 is negative 3 over 3 minus 1 is 2. So, we know the slope is

00:00:56.167 --> 00:01:02.883
negative 3 halves, which is why you see negative 3 halves x in the equation.

00:01:02.883 --> 00:01:10.204
But, how did we get 7 halves? There's a couple different ways to do this. We

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:17.225
also know that the slope is equal to y minus y1 over x minus x1. So, our slope

00:01:17.225 --> 00:01:23.605
was negative 3 halves and that's going to equal y minus y1, y minus 2 over x

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:30.423
minus x 1, which is 1. And again, I can cross multiply. When I cross multiply, I

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:36.226
have negative 3 times x minus 1 equals 2 times y minus 2. Now, I have to

00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:43.178
distribute. After I distribute, I have negative 3x. Negative 3 times negative 1

00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:49.625
is positive 3 equals 2y. 2 times negative 2 is negative 4. To put this in slop-

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:55.763
intercept form, to put this equation in slope-intercept form, the first thing

00:01:55.763 --> 00:02:01.343
I'm going to do is subtract 3 from both sides, and I get negative 3x equals 2y

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:08.037
minus 7. If I just go ahead and add 4 to both sides, I get negative 3x plus 7

00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:17.167
equals 2y. And I can still divide everything through by 2. And I get y equals

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:24.860
negative 3 halves x plus 7 halves. And we know that negative 3 halves x plus 7

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.603
halves equals y, is the same as y equals negative 3 halves x plus 7 halves. Now,

00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:36.987
we're going to try a couple of problems with parallel and perpendicular lines.
