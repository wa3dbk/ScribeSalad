00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.110
Before we get into any crazy
multi-project Android builds,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.200
we should talk about how to figure out
what's going on when your build fails.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.060
While it's technically possible
to attach a debugger to Gradle

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.590
if you really know what you're doing,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.219
the first line of defense should
really be thorough logging.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.900
Gradle logs messages
in one of six levels.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.080
Debug spews a ton of, only occasionally,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.100
useful information on
Gradle's internal workings.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.830
Info gives much better insight
into what Gradle is up to.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.720
It details how long each
task takes to complete, and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.200
other high level events,
like when Gradle connects to its Daemon.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.380
Lifecycle logs what tasks are currently
being run, as well as the total time

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.250
the build took, and whether or
not it was successful.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.060
Quiet is the level for log messages,
that should be this way

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.500
even if the user has told Gradle to be
quiet, but there aren't any errors.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.220
Also, any print line statements
in the build scripts

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.810
are actually redirected
to the quiet log level.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.990
Finally, error is exactly
what it sounds like.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.400
By default, Gradle displays all logs
at the lifecycle level and above.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.640
Running with the -d flag,
gives all logs at the debug level or

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.319
above, which is all of them.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:12.020
The -i flag, gives all logs
at the info level and above.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.000
And finally,
-q gives only quiet and error logs.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.820
Remember again that println
statements are equivalent to

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.130
the quiet logging level.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.140
This means that even if
the user uses the -q option,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.790
println statements will
still appear in the log.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.080
When the Gradle build
script fails to complete,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.530
it doesn't display
the stacktrace by default.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.970
If you want to see the stacktrace,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.600
gist of your code, use the stacktrace
option or the -s flag.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.820
To see the entire stacktrace,
including Gradle core code,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.910
you can use the -full-stacktrace option,
or a capital S.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.960
Again, make sure the difference
between these two is that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.700
the partial stack trace is a lowercase
sand the full stack trace uppercase S.
