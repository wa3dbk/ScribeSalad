00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.971
For this first equation, I have an A of negative 2, and a B of positive 3, so my

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:09.310
slope is 2 3rd. For the second equation, the A is positive 3 and the B is

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.130
positive 2. So I get a slope of negative 3 halves. The slops are opposite in

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.048
sign, and reciprocals of one another, so they must be perpendicular. For the

00:00:19.048 --> 00:00:24.070
second pair of lines I know that the first slope is 3 4th and the second slope

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.756
is 4 3rd.. These slopes are reciprocals of one another, but they're not opposite

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:32.631
in sign so they can be perpendicular and are not the same so they can be

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:37.337
parallel so they must be neither these lines will just intersect somewhere. For

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:41.473
the last two equations, we can find that their slopes are both negative 2. So

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:45.805
they're the same. They must be parallel, b. Through the last two skills checks,

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:49.773
I hope you've gained a better understanding of what it means for lines to be

00:00:49.773 --> 00:00:51.426
perpendicular and parallel.
