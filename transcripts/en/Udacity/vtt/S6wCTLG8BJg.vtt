00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.250
So here's one way to solve this, we're

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.770
going to define a procedure Fibonacci and we'll call the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.160
input n. And now we need to write

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.930
the code, and if we remember our definitions; so

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.550
we said Fibonacci of 0 is defined as 0,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.640
Fibonacci of 1 is defined as 1. And Fibonacci of any higher number

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.780
is defined as Fibonacci of n minus 1 plus Fibonacci of n

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.570
minus 2. So if you remember the definition, we

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.520
have two base cases we need to consider. If the

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.980
input value is 0, or the input value is 1,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.910
we need to do something special. So we could write

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.560
those as separate if statements. So if n is

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.965
equal to 0, what we want to do is return

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:50.980
0. If n is equal to 1, what we want to do is return 1. Otherwise what we want to

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.182
do is the recursive part of the definition. So we want

00:00:56.182 --> 00:01:00.835
to return the result of Fibonacci n minus 1, and we want

00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:04.879
to add that to Fibonacci n minus 2. So we could

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.280
simplify this a little bit. Let's try this in the Python interpreter.
