00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.969
Frequently, you'll want to show
content on top of imagery,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.640
particularly icons or text.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.200
When doing so, you'll need to ensure
that it is clear and legible.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.970
This is especially important for
dynamic content when you

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.250
don't know exactly what the color or
how complicated the image will be.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.910
For example, with this dark image,
we can see the title text and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.440
the share icon but
if the image given to us is light,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.970
the title and icon get somewhat lost.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.130
For the overlayed icon,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.140
we can use a subtle shadow on the image
to separate it from the background.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.080
Here we've added a subtle dark
shadow to the white icon so

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.620
that it's visible, even if the content
behind is similarly colored.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.520
Third, text,
adding shadows are possible but

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.330
it can make the text itself
somewhat harder to read.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.510
A better approach is to
use what we call a scrim.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.450
Now this is a semitransparent
layer between the image and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.680
the text to help provide contrast and
legibility.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.690
Here we're using a gradient
scrim which goes from 30% opaque

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.430
black at the bottom to
complete transparency.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.380
The black gives enough contrast for
the overlayed white text to be readable.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.300
Let's take a look at the scrim
from an angle giving you a clearer

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.320
representation of what is going on.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.570
Now, the gradient sits on top of
the image but below the overlayed text.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.240
We could have used a solid block of
color, rather than the gradient,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.560
which would reduce the overall
impact on the image but

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.138
the sudden change can be distracting.

00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:28.960
You should choose the size of your
scrim and the opacity values to get

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.280
the best legibility without
distracting from the image.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.720
To implement this technique,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.910
we can use a gradient drawable
placed on top of an image view.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.760
Here, we're creating a gradient and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.090
it's going to fade from this color here,
which is 30% opaque black,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.980
at the bottom to completely
transparent at the center and top.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.820
We can then use a FrameLayout
to stack our views.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.580
First, we place the ImageView at
the back to display the picture.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.470
Next, we place a View which has
that scrim drawable we just created

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.510
that's set as its background.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.300
Finally, we place
a TextView on top of it,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.699
which is going to draw
the text here at the bottom.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.610
Don't be afraid of layering
content on top of imagery.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.780
It can be a great effect for
creating a mess of apps.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.870
Do, however, be careful to make
sure that it's always legible.
