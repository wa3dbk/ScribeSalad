In addition to the genetic and environmental evidence for personality, there's

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.798
also evidence for a biological basis for personality. The psychologist Hans

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:14.014
Eysenck developed a biological theory of introversion and extroversion as well

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:18.984
as neuroticism. He proposed that differences in people's nervous systems lead

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:24.350
to different personality. This is most easily seen in the introversion and

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.687
extroversion dimension of personality. Eysenck argued that two qualities of the

00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:34.490
central nervous system led to introversion and extroversion. The first is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.061
arousal levels of the cortex. And the second is threshold for sensory

00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.220
stimulation. Let's look at these a little more closely.
