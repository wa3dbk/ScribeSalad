00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.200
In this case I want to start with finding the countries that participated in

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.790
a given year since it's a litte bit more complicated than simply filtering our

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.090
data by year.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.950
And once we see how to select the countries of interest

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.600
filtering the years should be quite easy.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.480
In order to find every country that has participated for a given year,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.680
we're going to go back to our aggregation functions that we've defined for

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.250
use on our nested object.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.330
We can see here in the agg year function.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.769
Which will get passed leaves, and if you remember, in this case,

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.180
it's all of the games for a given year grouped, and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.044
after we compute what we've already found of the sum of the attendance.

00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:45.011
And the coordinates to draw,

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:49.817
we can simply group the teams together into an array to return in the end.

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:54.290
D3 actually has a lot of great built in data structures, and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.790
functions to filter and transform data.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.680
In this case we're going to be using d3's built-in set data structure

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.550
which functions just like other sets in math or other programming languages.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.790
It's a collection of distinct or unique objects.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.580
It has the property that if you add an element to a set is already contained in

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.890
it, it doesn't add a duplicate.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.880
Here we've initialized an empty set, which we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.120
can then iterate through our teams for a given year, adding them one at a time.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.130
To do this, we can use JavaScript's built-in forEach function called on

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.120
our leaves array.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.520
ForEach is similar to map, except for

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.770
instead of returning an array, as we did when we found our coordinates.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.900
It simply runs an accessor function and

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.420
passes every element of our array, one at a time.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.630
In this case, we're not actually returning anything from our for

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.980
each, we're only adding team one and team two to our set.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.220
And again, since the set automatically de-duplicates anything, we don't have to

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.590
worry about adding teams multiple times, the set takes care of that for us.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.780
So in the end,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.700
the set will represent a collection of unique teams for a given year.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.940
And to pass our teams to our return object, we call .values.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.280
On the teams set, which turns the set of team names,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.050
into an array that we can handle easily in the rest of our code.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.310
Now that we have the teams for a given year,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.070
let's go back to our update function, and put all the pieces together.
