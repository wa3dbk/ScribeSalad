00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.294
This ellipse would be centered at negative 1 comma 3. It'll have an a value of

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:10.872
1 and it would have a b value of 5. Nice work if you got these 3 correct. We

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:14.900
can find this center by looking at the x squared term and the y squared term.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.853
The x is a plus 1 x to it so that means the x coordinate of the center will be

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:26.015
negative 1 and the value y has a negative 3 or subtraction of 3 next to it. So,

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:30.748
this means that the y coordinate of the center is positive 3. Always keep in

00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:33.988
mind that the values of h and k for our center are the opposite of these two

00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:40.560
signs. This will always be true for circles and ellipses. So, now we need to

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.205
find the values of a and b. So, what we should do is take our equation and

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:50.149
divide through by 100. That will set our equation equal to 1. So, here's my

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.294
original equation and now we're going to divide each term by 100. A 100 divided

00:00:55.294 --> 00:01:01.586
by a 100 equals 1, so this will simplify. An then we have 4 divided by a 100.

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:08.142
Well 4 divided by 4 equals 1. An 4 divided it into 100, equals 25. So, we'll

00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:11.854
have 1 in our numerator, with the y minus 3 squared divided by 25 and the

00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:17.340
denominator. I don't write the 1 here because it's just multiplication, 1 times

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.749
any expression is itself. And then finally, on the right hand side, we'll just

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.690
have 1. Now we want this equation to look like this one. But notice I don't

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.795
have an a squared term, I don't exactly have a fraction here but really I do.

00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:37.004
Remember we can divide any expression by 1, dividing by 1 will give us this

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:43.322
same exact expression. So, now I can rewrite these denominators with 1 squared

00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:49.094
equally 1 and 5 squared equaling 25. This is how we get the values away and b,

00:01:49.094 --> 00:01:54.330
and thinking back to our center. The value of h really needs to be negative 1

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.445
in order for the equation to have positive 1. And the value of k would need to

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:06.516
be 3 since we'll have 3 here. So, we can see that our center is at negative 1,

00:02:06.516 --> 00:02:12.015
3. Then we move 1 unit left and right to get 2 points on our ellipse. And we

00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:17.464
move 5 units up and down to get two more points on the ellipse. Highlighting

00:02:17.464 --> 00:02:21.112
these points, we can see that these two are 5 units above and below our center,

00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:26.276
and that this point is 1 unit to the right of our center. Now desmos isn't

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:30.111
showing this point, but that's just because it only shows us certain points of

00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:34.394
interest. Now, there a reason why it's only showing us these points of

00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:38.615
interest. And when you learn more about ellipses, you'll discover why these

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:43.454
points are so important. For this one, it happens to be a y intercept. And, in

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:47.548
fact, desmos will also tell us the x intercepts. These other two points are

00:02:47.548 --> 00:02:51.360
really important and perhaps you can do some research to figure out why.
