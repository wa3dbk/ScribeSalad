00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.710
You're going to be learning
a lot about different rules for

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.810
performance in this course, but it's
important to keep a few things in mind.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.910
First off, the tools that you'll be
learning are way more important than

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.190
the rules that you'll be learning.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.900
Rules are helpful, but
they change over time.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.660
It's much more important that you become
comfortable with the tools at your

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.520
disposal because they'll provide
the real insight into your app's

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.730
performance.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.790
Along the same lines,
numbers change and bugs get fixed.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.189
In fact, the numbers change part
even happened to us while we were

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.670
working on this course.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.650
There's a quiz in the fifth lesson
where we ask about CSS selectors and

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.450
we mentioned that one of them is one
hundred times slower than the others.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.630
The reason it was slower,
we found out, was a bug.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.130
In fact, as we were working on this
course, the developers working on

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.640
Blink and WebKit actually fixed the bug,
and our comment was no longer true.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.450
What this experience really
reinforced for me is that it is so

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.300
important to focus on the tools
not the rules, themselves.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.290
Understanding the tools allows you to
measure first and measure often, and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.130
measurements are the key to
understanding performance.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.970
You should measure to understand what
performance issues you're actually

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.280
facing, and then later you should
keep measuring to decide whether or

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.570
not your changes
are actually fixing them.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.870
So remember, focus on the tools,
not the rules.
