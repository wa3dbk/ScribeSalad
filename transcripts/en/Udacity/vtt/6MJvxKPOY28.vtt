00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.050
Variables are called variables because they can vary. Here's a variable. It's

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.240
initial value is 228, but I can vary that if the need arises. Maybe the trip

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.850
took longer than I thought. Here I'm setting the variable to a different value.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.685
Note that. The declaration looks almost the same as the assignment, where I

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:30.490
assign a new value to an existing variable. The only way you can tell them

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.660
apart is that the assignment has no type. The declaration has the type in here.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.920
The assignment looks just like a declaration except there's no type. That tips

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.402
us off that traveltime is an existing variable, whereas over here where we say

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:52.760
int traveltime, it is a new variable. One way of thinking about a variable is

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.800
as a little box with a name. Of course, the value is inside the box, and it can

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.340
vary. As a result, of such an assignment. Now we've assigned a new value, to

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.640
the variable, and the new value is stored, in the little box.
