00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.010
After you decide which model you wish
to implement, it's time to shape it and

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.300
learn from it what is working and
what's not.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.090
&gt;&gt; We'll go into the details of how
to track success in the next lesson.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.460
But, it's important to get
the hooks in place early,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.290
so that you can monitor
performance later.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.100
At this point, you also probably
want to track as much as possible.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.900
Think about any actions and
events that you can learn from,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.330
and add them to the tracking,
so that it's set by default.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.400
&gt;&gt; If you have a decent audience,
it might be a good idea to

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.360
test your model on x% of your users,
and learn from it.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.790
If you want to learn more about A/B
testing, we've linked to another A/B

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.250
testing course on Udacity
in the instructor notes.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.870
In the next node,
we'll provide resources telling you

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.850
exactly how to set up
tracking in your product.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.550
We recommend that you follow the steps
now to get things set up early.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.640
If you currently don't have a product
that you can track, then we recommend

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.070
reading through the resources to
familiarize yourself with the process.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.500
And then bookmark relevant
resources to return to later.
