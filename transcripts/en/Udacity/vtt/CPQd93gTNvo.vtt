00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.830
Here are two other expressions with absolute value. I'm going to apply the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.254
order of operations and then the absolute value to get my answer. Absolute

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:12.126
value acts as a grouping symbol. I need to evaluate any expressions inside of

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:15.778
it first. But it's a particular grouping symbol, because it means the distance

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:19.784
from zero. So whenever I get my answer, I need to figure out, how far is that

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:26.780
answer from zero? Have the absolute value of the negative of 3 squared plus 2

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.240
times 4 squared. Remember, whenever there's a negative sign standing alone.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.173
It's really a negative 1 times. So I'm going to have my absolute value. I'll

00:00:37.173 --> 00:00:43.728
have 3 squared, which is 9. The negative one right before it. Then plus 2 times

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:48.746
4 squared. When I look at what to do next, I know I still have a power. I'm

00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:54.440
going to do 4 squared. 4 times 4 is 16. Now I'm going to do the multiplication.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.908
Negative 1 times 9 is negative 9. And 2 times 16 is 32. I'm going to add 32 and

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:08.336
negative nine, or 32 minus nine. And I get the absolute value of 23. The

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:14.354
absolute value or the distance of 23 from zero is 23. Okay for the second

00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:19.730
problem I have the negative of the absolute value of negative 9 minus 3, times

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.985
the quantity 5 minus 2 squared. Remember, here's a negative side standing

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:30.988
alone. So I really have negative 1 times this value. So negative 1's on the

00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:36.278
outside, and then absolute value symbol. When thinking about what to do next, I

00:01:36.278 --> 00:01:40.122
need to start with this inside parentheses. I'm going to go ahead and list

00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:46.626
negative 9 minus 3. For this inside parentheses, I'll do 5 minus 2 squared. I

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:52.034
know 2 squared is 4. So I have 5 minus 4. My negative 1 is still on the

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:58.412
outside. I have absolute value of negative 9 minus 3 times 1. Now I'm going to

00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:05.145
do multiplication. I have the absent value of negative 3 minus 3,. Minus 9 and

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:10.176
minus 3 is negative 12. So, I have minus 1 on my outside and minus 12 inside my

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:16.450
absolute value. When I take the absolute value of negative 12, I get positive

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.872
12. The distance, or the absolute value of negative 12 from 0 is 12. So I have

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:28.373
negative 1 times a 12. Notice that when I take the absolute value of something,

00:02:28.373 --> 00:02:32.510
I no longer need to write the symbol absolute value. I've taken its positive

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.234
distance from 0. The distance of negative 12 from 0 is 12. Then, my final

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:41.104
answer, I have negative 1 times 12, or negative 12.
