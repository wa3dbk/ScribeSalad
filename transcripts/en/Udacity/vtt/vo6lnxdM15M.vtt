00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This question is about voting and mixed nets.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Consider a mix net with 4 non-colluding mixers and 1000 voters.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The question is, what is the maximum number of votes that can be audited for each mixer

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
while keeping the probability that an observer who can observe all network traffic

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
can trace Alice's vote less than 0.001?
