00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.110
We're going to open up the Network tab in DevTools to start off.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.570
The Network tab gives us a list of all the requests and

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.010
responses fired off by the browser in loading and rendering a Web page.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.330
If we're recording as the Web page loads,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.770
we'll see all sorts of resources that the website needs.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.020
We see images, we see JavaScript files, and we even see some CSS.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.440
In a moment, I'm going to stop and then start recording to get a fresh slate.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.380
When we scroll down as far as we can, we'll hit a quick pause and

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.156
then all the sudden, new content will appear.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:34.280
In Network, we're going to see that request show up.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.920
Let's go ahead and try it.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.100
I will stop and start recording And scroll down.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.720
There we go.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.480
We could see it right there.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.250
All right, let's see what we have in here.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.280
We can see a request happen right here.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.520
Let's click on it.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.860
This request is called PagePostSectionPagelet.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.880
And look, it's even got the word ajax inside the u, request URL.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.240
At this point, I'm going to switch to some written instructions so

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.980
you can follow along with me.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.060
I recommend opening up two browser windows side by side.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.440
That way, you can follow along in Facebook in one window while you've got

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.280
the instructions from Udacity in the other.
