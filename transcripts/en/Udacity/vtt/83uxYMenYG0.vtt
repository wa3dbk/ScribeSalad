We're about to take a look at the graph of f of x equals 3x minus 8 over x

00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:11.134
minus 5. But just before we do, let's find it's vertical asymptote. Where do

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:15.246
you think it is? Remember, we just need to check what value of x is going to

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:19.535
make the denominator equal to 0. Write in the equation of the asymptote right

00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:20.251
here.
