00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.034
Since we're factoring by grouping, we want to look at these first two terms

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:10.351
first, 2z cubed minus 3z squared. The only common factor that they share is a z

00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:15.490
squared. So we can rewrite them as z squared times 2z minus 3. Now, onto the

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.463
last two terms, negative 6z plus 9 has a common factor of negative 3. Now, of

00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:25.113
course, we could have pulled out a positive three instead and left this as a

00:00:25.113 --> 00:00:29.838
negative 2z plus 3, but I'd rather have a positive coefficient in front of my

00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:34.669
variable, that's just a personnel preference thing. Now we just pull out the

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:39.487
common factor between the two terms we have left, that common factor is 2z minus

00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:43.693
3 and then what's left over is z squared minus 3. And voila, we are fully

00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:44.320
factored.
