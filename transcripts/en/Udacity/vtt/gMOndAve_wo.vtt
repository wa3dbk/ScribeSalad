00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.410
We're going to continue with our
conversation about segmentation.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.890
And this time we're
going to up a little bit,

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.540
the sophistication of some of
the methods that we're talking about.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.280
So far, all of our segmentation
work has really talked about

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.070
sort of clustering pixels
within some feature space.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.110
That is sort of describing each of the
pixels so i might build the clusters in

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.390
position, and and intensity or position
in color, or even in a texture space.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.960
What we didn't really do was talk about

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.670
the connection between one pixel and
another.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.270
Right, I mean after all if you're doing
a segmentation the idea is that you're

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.520
going to be drawing a boundary and
you're going to say nope you,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.080
you go to the left you,
you go to the right.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.120
So I, want to talk about
the connection between pixels.
