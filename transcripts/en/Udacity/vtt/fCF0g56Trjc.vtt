00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.400
So how did you check that your code worked?

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.280
Hopefully, you did check that the conference keys to

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.070
attend contains conference key string. And you shouldn't have

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.570
found the conference keys to attend contained conference name, because

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.630
it doesn't. So another good thing to check is

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.030
that after you register for a conference, the seats available

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.060
goes down by one. So the first time you

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.570
register the seats available, it's going to down by one less

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.200
than the max attendees. Of course, if you log out

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.490
and log in as a different user and then register

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.310
for the same conference again, seats available is going to go

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.110
down by even more than one less the max attendees.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.430
And yes, in our application you can register for a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.610
conference you created. Okay. So let's take a quick look

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.560
at the finished code for register for conference. And we're

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.610
in the conference API class here. You already know if

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.700
the user's null through an unauthorized exception. Here

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.720
we start the transaction ofy.transact and then here, we

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.010
do the public wrapped Boolean run, wrapped Boolean

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.050
is what we're going to return. We get the

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.130
conference key. We just load the conference from

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.730
the datastore, should be familiar with doing that by

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.860
now. If there's no conference found, take the appropriate

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.730
action. Get the user's profile from the data store.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.400
Check the various conditions before we allow the user

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.330
to register, and if all looks good, go ahead

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.280
and book the seat. So we add the conference

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.290
key to the conference keys to attend property of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.559
the profile, we book the seat on the conference.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.630
And then, very importantly, we save the profile and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.360
the conference and we return the wrapped Boolean. Now,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.060
if we didn't get a success throw the exceptions.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.570
We already talked about that.
