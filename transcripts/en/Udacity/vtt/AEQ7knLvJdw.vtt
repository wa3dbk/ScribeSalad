00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.820
Starting with 1, 1 isn't zero, so that's going to be truthy.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.640
Awesome is a string of more than zero characters, so

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.460
that's going to also be truthy.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.240
Undefined is simply falsy.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.450
-42 isn't zero.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.449
This one's kind of tricky, but it's also truthy.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.960
Then we come up to this object.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.850
And despite the fact that its one property has a value of false, it's an object,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.600
which means that it is truthy.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.130
Lastly, we've got this array with a single value of false.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.990
Because it's an array, it going to be truthy
