00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now I'd like to ask you to find a median for me,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but I'd also like to introduce a little twist.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the lecture, we said that the median is an element in the set, in the middle of the set.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So if there's an even number, it can be 1 of 2 things.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So I'd like you to give me one of those medians here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We'll call this the in data type of median.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But the problem with it is it's not unique.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Many people prefer to use a unique median,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and to do that, they just take the simple mean of the acceptable answers for the in data method.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Tell me the unique median over here.
