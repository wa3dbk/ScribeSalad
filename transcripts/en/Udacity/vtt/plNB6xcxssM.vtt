We've solved the equations with fractions, now let's see how we can use a

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:09.242
similar approach to work with decimals. Here I have 2 and 3 10th times n plus 4

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:13.846
98 100th equals 3 times n plus 2 and 6 10th. Notice how I read these place

00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:18.492
values as 10th and this as 100th. If I want to remove the decimals from my

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:23.222
equation I would multiply by a number that moves the decimal point to the right.

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:27.925
We can multiply both the left by a 100 and the right by a 100. If we remember

00:00:27.937 --> 00:00:32.606
back from scientific notation multiplying by 100 moves the decimal 2 places to

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:37.305
the right. Now I have an equation just made up of integers. See if you can solve

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:41.822
the rest of this problem. And, notice too about the last step that you'll do.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:43.531
Think about why that happens.
