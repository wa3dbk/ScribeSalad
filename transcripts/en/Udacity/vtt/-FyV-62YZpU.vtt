00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You may have heard the story of Ariane 5 rocket which famously exploded on its first flight

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
due to software bug sometimes called the most expensive software bug in history.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Do you know why the Ariane 5 exploded?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It exploded simply because it had a bug in a 64-bit integer to 16-bit integer conversion.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The interesting thing though is that normally

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the code actually did have plenty of checks to track such illegal conversion.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
These checks were disabled in the Ariane 5 for reasons of performance.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Picture what would have happened if the computer in the Ariane 5

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
had been just so slightly be more performant to cover this particular check of a 64-bit

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to a 16-bit integer then the assertion would have triggered even during the launch,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but the Ariane 5 actually does have a very good recovery mechanisms for failing assertions.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It would have recovered, may be the flight could have done well

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we would have escaped the most expensive software bug in history.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
$317,000,000 went into the sky because of a missing assertion.
