00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
So one of the best ways to understand channels is to think about how business first started.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.420
We first started distributing and making physical products--cars, food, utilities, etc.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.410
and we distributed them through direct sales force--that is people

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.220
you shook hands with, look in the eye and met.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.120
And it wasn't until the mid-20th century when we actually started selling virtual products--

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.560
things that didn't quite exist physically like insurance, stocks and bonds, enterprise softwares,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.460
shrinkwrap software start to be distributed through physical channels but they didn't exist in the real world.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.450
But it wasn't until the mid-1990s with the emergence of the Internet that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.080
we were able to distribute physical products through a virtual channel.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:52.520
Think of Amazon or Zappos or Netflix--even consumer electronics sold through the web.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.590
And what's happened in the beginning of the 21st century is we now have products

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.680
that don't exist at all--Facebook, Twitter, Google--they're all bits,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.510
and they're also distributed via the web.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.250
This virtual virtual distribution channel allows for easier customerization, optimization,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.570
and allows you to change both product and channel almost on the fly.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.550
Through the rest of this lecture, we're going to show you which channels might be optimum

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.470
for your startup and allow you to chose which one to pick.
