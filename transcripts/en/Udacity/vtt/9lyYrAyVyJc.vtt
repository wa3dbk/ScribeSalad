00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.980
Let's look at the inverse of linear functions. We're going to find the inverse

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.160
function of f of x equals 2 x plus 3. We've seen functions like these before.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.916
This is just a linear equation that crosses the y axis at 0, 3 since the y

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:21.720
receptor's 3. The slope of this equation is 2, so we'll rise 2 and then we'll

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.695
move to the right one unit. Now this is all the way back to unit three when we

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:31.412
first learned about lines. But now what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:37.528
undo these operations. We know f of x is the same thing as y. This is just the

00:00:37.528 --> 00:00:41.814
output. So, now, the first thing we need to do to find the inverse function is

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:47.052
to switch x and y. If we switch the variables x and y, then we get this new

00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:54.320
equation. X equal 2 y plus 3. Now we just need to solve for y to get our new

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.150
inverse function. so you tell me, what would you get for y if you solved for

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.495
it? In other words, what's the expression over here that involves x? As a hint,

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:08.652
it should be a fraction.
