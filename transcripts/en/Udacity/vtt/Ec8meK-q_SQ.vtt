00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.769
Let's make sure you've mastered this skill. Write these different numbers in

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.620
scientific notation. The first is the distance from the earth to the moon. The

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.360
second is the distance light travels in a year. And this last small number is

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.089
the wavelength of red light. A wavelength of light is a measurement from the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.917
crest to the crest, or a trough to a trough. If you're interested about light,

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:23.255
try looking some things up. Write your answers in scientific notation in these

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:27.358
boxes, and don't include the unit. I've got that written for you. Also, be sure

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:31.404
you don't round any of the numbers. You want the most accurate number with all

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:34.004
the decimals after the decimal point. Good luck.
