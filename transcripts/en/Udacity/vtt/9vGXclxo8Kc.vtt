00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.220
So, this is a pretty tough question. If you weren't able to

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.350
get it yourself, that's okay. What I'd encourage you to do is stop

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.090
in the middle of the explanation, once the part where you got

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.850
stuck on makes sense, and see if you can finish it yourself. So,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.330
what we need to do is define a function, so we're going to

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.980
define a function hash-string, and it takes two inputs, the keyword and number

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.330
of buckets. And we're going to keep track of where we are in the

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.640
circle. We need to introduce a new variable to do that, and we

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.780
should start at position zero. So, we'll initialize that variable.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.790
We'll use h to represent the hash, and we'll initialize that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.260
to zero. Now, we want to go through the characters in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.300
the keyword. So, we'll have a for loop that goes

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.650
through each character in keyword. And for each character, we

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.960
want to add to the hash. So, we're going to add to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.928
the hash, the value of that character. We could do the

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:51.730
modulo here, so we could, at this point, use modulo buckets.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.660
We have to be careful to have the parentheses here. If we

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.365
just have the modulo buckets here, we wouldn't get the right result.

00:00:57.365 --> 00:00:59.690
because it would do ord c modulo buckets, but what we really

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.460
need to do is modulo buckets, the sum that we get from h

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.380
and ord c. And then at the end, we're going to return the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.280
hash value. We could, instead of doing the modulo each time here, we

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.970
could do the modulo just once at the end. That would be

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.640
computing a big number if we have a really big string, and then,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.610
at the end, compute our modulo buckets. Either way should work.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820
This way's a little better, in the sense that if our

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.520
string is very long, we would have to compute a really,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.230
really big number, which gets to be more expensive. And we

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.790
might even run out if it's a super long keyword. So,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.490
it's better to do the modulo here. We get the same

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.300
result either way though. Let's try this in the Python interpreter.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.990
So, here's the code that we wrote out on the sketchpad.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.980
We have our variable, h, which is going to keep track

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.650
of the hash value. We're going to go through all the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.550
characters in the keyword, adding each one into the hash

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.800
value, modulo the number of buckets. So let's try the examples.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.890
So a, with 12 buckets, hashes the bucket one as

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.590
we expect, and if we look at b. And hash just

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.008
the bucket two, also as we expect. So, one other thing

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.320
we should try, if you remember, when we had the really

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.530
bad hash string function. One of the many problems it had

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890
was it didn't work on all strings, in particular, did not

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.690
work on empty strings. Do you think our hash string function

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.920
here will work on the empty string? Try to guess what

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.440
the result should be before I run it. And then I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.730
will run it. And you see the result is zero. So, no

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.230
error. And it makes sense that the result is zero. We

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.700
start with h is zero. When there are no characters in the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.130
string, we don't go through this loop at all. So, h

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.360
is still zero when we return. And let's also try the longer

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.800
example. When we hash the string udacity with 12 buckets, we get

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.440
bucket 11. We should be able to increase the number of buckets.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.500
So, let's increase the number of buckets. Let's suppose we had 1,000 buckets,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.670
and we get bucket 755. This isn't enough to convince us that our hash string

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.650
function is distributing all strings well between

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.390
all buckets. But at least we're getting

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.070
a, a fairly large number that says we might be using all the buckets.
