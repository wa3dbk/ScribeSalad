[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:07.410
Something significant to
Miwoks would be acorns.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.860
What I've learned is that going to
these annual celebrations the big time.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.980
Acorns are life.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.130
That's where food comes from.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.070
And just the celebration around it.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.610
It's a gathering of people.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.780
It's grinding them, it's leaching them.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.520
The baskets, the basket weaving.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.360
There are baskets that are made for
leaching.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.750
There are baskets made for
gathering, storing.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.070
So to me I would say acorns
would be a big significant

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.280
item to the Miwok people.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.762
So around the region where Miwok are,

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:49.180
there are the black oak acorns.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.775
And they just have a sweeter taste when
you leech out the tannins, soak them.

00:00:55.775 --> 00:01:01.050
They're, they have a sweeter taste than
I don't want to say a regular oak tree,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.560
but a different type of tree that is
more bitter, it's a bitter taste.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.670
You can make soups, bread,
one of the interviews

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.780
that I did with my grandmother,
and I had no idea about this.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.010
We had a whole plot of land up in Iowa,
and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.430
my great grandmother would go out into
the backyard, and she would dig a hole

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.026
and line it with cheesecloth, and
she would leach acorns in our backyard.

00:01:27.026 --> 00:01:31.510
She would make soups,
she would make bread.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.700
I think she would even make
tortillas out of them.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.170
And acorn mush.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.033
But yeah,
that was something that I never knew and

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.970
my grandma shared with you one day,
and it's like,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.315
I would never have known that just
in the backyard where I grew up.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:51.380
[LAUGH] There were leaching of acorns.
