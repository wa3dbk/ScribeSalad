00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.542
So here's a pseudo co-description of an algorithm that follows what we did as

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:07.538
humans. Now let's think about this a little more carefully. So the questions is;

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:11.046
Should we go ahead and implement this algorithm? Are we close enough to start

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:14.202
writing the actual python code? There are four choices. First is that yes, we

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:17.280
should go ahead and implement this, and we'll end up with the correct solution.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.802
The second is that; We should start implementing this. It doesn't address all

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:23.861
cases, but this is a good start and we'll figure out the details as we go. The

00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:27.566
third choice is no, that we should figure out how to address all the cases first

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:31.271
and make sure that we have correct pseudo code before we try writing any actual

00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:35.072
python code. And finally no, we should give up on this direction and try to find

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:36.873
a simpler way to solve this problem.
