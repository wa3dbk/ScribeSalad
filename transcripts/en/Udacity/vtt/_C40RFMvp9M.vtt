If you got 23 for the numerator and 24 for the denominator, you got it right.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.658
Let's see how to get that answer. I know when I add fractions, I have to have

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.439
the denominators be the same. So, the first thing that we need to do is find a

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:20.010
common denominator between 12 and 8. Using the factor tree method, I know that 4

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:26.405
is a common factor for both 12 and 8. I know that 4 times 3 is 12. And 4 times 2

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:32.359
gives me 8. So, I can multiply those together, which gives me a common

00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:38.271
denominator of 24. The next thing I need to do is create equivalent fractions

00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:43.919
that have 24 as the denominator. So, I need to create equivalent fraction for 7

00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:49.560
over 12. Since we want to have 24 in the denominator, I know I have to multiply

00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:54.930
12 by 2 to get 24 and whatever I multiply the denominator by, I also have to

00:00:54.942 --> 00:01:00.389
multiply the numerator by. So, an equivalent fraction for 7/12 is 14 over 24.

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:07.524
Now, let's convert 3/8. We want 24 as the denominator. 8 times 3 gives us 24. 8

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.576
times 3 is 24. 3 times 3 is 9. Now, I have an equivalent fraction for 7/12 and I

00:01:14.588 --> 00:01:21.213
have an equivalent fraction for 3/8. I can now rewrite the problem using my

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:28.210
equivalent fractions. I have 14 over 24 plus 9 over 24. When I add fractions, I

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:34.760
keep the denominator the same and I add the numerators. 14 and 9 is 23. This

00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:41.685
answer is already simplified because there are no factors in common between 23

00:01:41.697 --> 00:01:42.235
and 24.
