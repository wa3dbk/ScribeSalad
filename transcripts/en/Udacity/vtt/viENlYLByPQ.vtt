00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's continue with our example.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're testing the square root routine, and now we're going to test it with the input value of -1.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we call square root of -1, and the question is, what should it return?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's make this into another little quiz.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Our possible answers are a) 1; b) i; c) not a number; d) throw some sort of an exception;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
e) -1; and f) just crash the machine.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so here's a text box for you, and I'd like you to type in all of the letters that apply

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as reasonable results for square root of -1.
