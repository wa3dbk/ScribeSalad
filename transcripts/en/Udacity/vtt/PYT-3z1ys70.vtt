On a CUDA compute capability 3.5 machine,

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:07.611
if I want to run the maximum number of threads possible

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:12.046
that are all resident on an SM at the same time,

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:17.283
each thread must use no more than how many registers?

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:18.886
Please fill in the number here.
