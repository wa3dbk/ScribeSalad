00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now that we've learned that it's harder as expected to control the brake,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
it's time to learn that it's hard as expected to measure the wheel slip.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
One simple approach to determine the velocity of the car is to use the W of all four wheels

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and to use the largest of them, so that when we have strong slippage for some wheels,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we hope that at least one of those wheels has full contact to the road's surface.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What do you think is the easiest way to improve that estimate of the car's velocity.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Should we be using GPS, should we be using a camera and do motion analysis

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of the camera frames, should we be using a 5th wheel--a lightweight one with no brake,

00:00:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or should we be using a accelerometer of that kind you know from smart phones and game consoles.
