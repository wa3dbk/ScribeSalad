00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.840
For the first one we just have p to the 3 5ths, power divided by root or the

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.540
index. For the second one we'll have the quantity of 3, 2 to the 4th raised to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.476
the 1, 6th. The power of this radican is really a 1, so we have our power of 1

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:19.692
divided by our index, our root, which is 6. For the third one we'll have the

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:23.695
quantity 5x squared raised to the 1 3rd power. We're taking the cubed root of

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:27.412
this expression, and again we don't use the 2 as a power because the square is

00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:33.410
not the power of the 5 as well. It's only the power of the x. We have this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.619
quantity raised to the 1, so there's our power and then the 3 or the cube for

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:42.699
our root. And for out last one we have 25 x squared raised to the one third

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.824
power. We have power divided by a root. You might have simplified this, which

00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:44.990
is great. We could have rewritten 25 x squared as the quantity 5x squared.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:58.700
Then, since we're raising a power to a power we can multiply 2 times 1 3rd.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.870
This would give us 5x raised to the 2 3rds, another acceptable answer. Great

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.473
work if you got at least two of those correct. I know these were pretty tricky.
