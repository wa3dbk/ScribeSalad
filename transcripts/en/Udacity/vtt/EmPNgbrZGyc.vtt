00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.969
So now that we are done with the work for Cycle Four let's see what happens in

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.700
Cycle Five. Two things will happen in Cycle Five.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.810
One is we are going to try to issue the next instruction. Another thing is,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.850
we're going to try to see if we can dispatch an instruction, write the result,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.770
or comment. Obviously we can issue this instruction so let's do that.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.030
So, the question for you is do we dispatch an instruction. Right here,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.690
which instruction gets dispatched? Leave it empty if none of them gets

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.980
dispatched. Another question for you is, do we write any results in this cycle?

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.290
If yes, write which instruction gets to write the results. If no, just leave

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.820
this empty and obviously we won't be committing any instructions. The name of

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.950
the instruction here should be the, really the ROB entry. So if it's for

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.520
example the ROB1 instruction that gets dispatched you should write ROB1 here.
