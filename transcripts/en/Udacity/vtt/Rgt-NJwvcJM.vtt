Furthermore, the instanceof operator works by checking to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.050
see if the right operand's .prototype object can be

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.260
found anywhere in the left operand's prototype chain.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.980
Here, Car.prototype can be found somewhere in amy's prototype chain.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.120
With that in mind, let's peek at some functional class code again for a moment.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.500
What would you expect to be logged in this case?
