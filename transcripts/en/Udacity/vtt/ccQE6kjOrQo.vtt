00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.626
The complex conjugate of 2 minus 3i is just two plus 3i. Once again, we just

00:00:04.626 --> 00:00:08.918
look at the sign of the coefficient b over here, the coefficient of the

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:13.390
imaginary part of the number and we flip it. It was negative and now it's

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.965
positive. Let's look then at the graphical relationship between complex

00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:23.352
conjugates. The two orange points here are one pair of conjugates, 3 plus 4i and

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:28.774
3 minus 4i. And the teal points are another pair, 2 plus 3i and 2 minus 3i. What

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:33.844
we notice is that the horizontal coordinate of either point in each pair is the

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:38.561
same. But the vertical coordinate is just flipped so each point is just a

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:43.479
reflection of the point it matches with across the real axis. If we have the

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.393
number negative 8 minus 4i, then its conjugate must be the point that has the

00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:53.619
same horizontal coordinate and the opposite vertical coordinate, so it will be

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.185
this negative 8 plus 4i which does seem to be correct.
