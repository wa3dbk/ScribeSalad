00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.248
Until now we've been using Docker
to run and install containers.

00:00:05.248 --> 00:00:09.520
But I'm going to show you that you can
also use Docker as a build environment.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.440
First let's build our application.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.862
You may have already done
this in a previous lesson.

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:20.280
I'm going to make a new directory to
hold our source code then I'm going to

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.300
change into that directory and
clone the example application.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.050
With the source code in place,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.480
we're ready to build our
monolithic app from lesson 1.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.340
After that's built, we're finally ready
to create a container for our app.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.960
We'll start by looking at our Dockerfile
for the monolith on this line we're

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.510
copying over the monolith built artifact
from the go build command earlier.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.810
The next line is where we
declare our entry point for

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.310
the container which will
be the monolith app.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.760
So with the Dockerfile and
a monolith binary in place.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.820
We are ready to build
the monolith Docker image.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.700
We'll use the Docker build command
to upload our build context

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.310
to the remote Docker daemon which
will execute the Docker build command

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.160
listed in the Dockerfile.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.710
This will reproduce an image for
the monolith application.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.490
Now that the Docker build is complete
use the Docker images command to list

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.889
the monolith image.

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:21.385
Let's make sure the monolith image is
good by using the Docker run command to

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:23.080
create a container from it.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.965
Now that we have a running
monolith container use the Docker

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:28.225
inspect command to grab its IP address.

00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:32.135
And now are we're ready to
test the monolith container

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:34.105
using the cURL command.

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:35.505
It works!

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:39.725
As you can see, building container
images are breeze when using Dockerfiles

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:40.785
and the Docker build command.
