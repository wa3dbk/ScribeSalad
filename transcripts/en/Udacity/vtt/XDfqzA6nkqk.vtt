00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.855
In my opinion, score on the Laraway personality test does not have an everyday

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.405
meaning. In other words, you don't necessarily know what the scores on this

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:11.980
test mean without specialized training. By the way, I just made this test up.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.434
It doesn't really exist. Notice the rest of these, number of correct items on

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:19.992
an exam, that has an everyday meaning. We all know what that means. Same with

00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:24.354
the number of minutes to fix a flat tire. And the number of hours slept. So in

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:28.735
cases where we don't understand what the variable is telling us. A mean

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:32.087
difference may not be the most informative measures. And for that reason,

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:35.300
statisticians have developed other effect size measures, that we will now

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.540
discuss.
