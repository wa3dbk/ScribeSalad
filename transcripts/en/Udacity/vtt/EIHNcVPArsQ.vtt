As an example, here's my blog, circa an embarassingly

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.670
short time ago. Now, if you resize this window,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.270
nothing really changes. Nothing adjusts other than

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.730
the amount of margin space. It's really

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.380
a fixed width layout. Now, let's take a look at this on the phone.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.340
Now here, I get a very different version of my

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.430
blog. It fits well on the phone, but I'm only

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.490
getting this because my blog is running on Wordpress. And,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.680
Wordpress is configured to give a totally different version to phones.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.050
But, that's not actually what I want. Because I really

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.370
want to have a shared layout between the two. Let's

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.900
take a look at this on a intermediate device. My

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.390
seven inch Android tablet. Now here, what I'm getting is essentially

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.080
the desktop version. I can still scroll through the

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.340
site but you can tell all the text is pretty

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.560
small. Although interestingly, if I rotate to landscape mode,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.200
it adapts. Now why does it do that? Well it

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.860
turns out it's our old friend viewport. There's now

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.230
viewport set in this page. So, what does that mean?

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.890
Does layout happen if the device flipped? Or does layout

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.460
happen at the magic 980 pixel width and then get

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.030
rescaled to fit on the screen?
