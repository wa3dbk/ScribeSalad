00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.625
These are the frequencies you should have got in and notice that they all add to

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:09.250
50, the total number of observations in our sample. Using a frequency table, we

00:00:09.262 --> 00:00:13.875
can easily see that most students are from China. It was probably tedious to do

00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:18.240
this by hand and I apologize, but sometimes when you do it by hand, you really

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:23.107
understand how to do it. We do, however, have technology that can tabulate this.

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:27.929
And so, we're going to make use of technology throughout this course. But every

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:31.043
once in a while, we'll have you do something by hand.
