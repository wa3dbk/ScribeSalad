00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.560
So, as we thought about
creating the purchasing flow,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:13.910
what we wanted to do was we wanted to
create an experience that was familiar.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.800
But, what really made it
super optimized is for

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.340
if you had a product out there
to make people purchase it.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.060
And for us,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.240
it is really important.to make it
like a clean purchase experience.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.890
And so, as we thought about how we
wanted to make our purchase flow

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.140
uniquely Teespring, one of the things
which we did realize was that

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.810
Teespring content is very much targeted.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.850
Or is very much optimize for
people wanting to show

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.570
it to their friends and share it like on
all the different platforms out there.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.410
And so one of our thoughts
was how can we make this

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.480
an experience where kind of people are
actually purchasing from the page but

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.420
at the same time encourage them to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.519
share it via email, Facebook, Twitter,
Pinterest and all these other channels.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.290
And so that was kind of the only other
kind of special optimization layer,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.160
I'd say,
that we did on the purchase flow.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.173
But otherwise,
the purchase flow kind of is a very

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:23.863
[INAUDIBLE] understood thing
across most e-commerce companies.
