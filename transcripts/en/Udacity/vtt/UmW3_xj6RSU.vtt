00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.536
The answer: Roughly half of them are going to do useful work.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:07.777
The actual fraction ends up being 0.516, and I'll say how I got that.

00:00:07.777 --> 00:00:09.846
So we've got 32 threads here.

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:14.735
I'm putting them on X-axis, and then on the Y-axis is the number of iterations.

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:18.353
We know that 1 thread will find its answer on the first iteration,

00:00:18.353 --> 00:00:22.158
the next thread will find its answer on the second iteration and so on.

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:25.730
So why don't we say the first thread finds it's answer on the first iteration.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.770
The second thread will find it's answer on the second iteration and so on.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.040
So eventually the last thread will take 32 iterations to find its answer,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.211
and what that means is that it has spent 32 iterations walking through this link list.

00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:46.047
We have 32 threads times 32 iterations, so the amount of work we could have that's useful

00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:49.619
is sort of the product of the number of threads and the number of iterations.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.969
So we see all of this area in that square is being useful.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.134
These threads are doing useful work;

00:00:57.134 --> 00:01:01.450
they're walking through the link list until they find their item right here and stop,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.612
but all the blue area here, on the other hand, is wasted work.

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:09.523
We have threads that have gone to sleep, because they've already found their item,

00:01:09.523 --> 00:01:13.956
and now they're not doing anything useful; they're just waiting for the last thread to finish.

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:16.071
So if you actually do the math in detail,

00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:20.627
what you'll find is the red area compared to the entire square area is slightly more than half,

00:01:20.627 --> 00:01:24.249
but basically what we're looking at here is that roughly half the time

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:28.887
if we pick any random thread, it's going to be asleep and waiting for some other thread to finish

00:01:28.887 --> 00:01:35.403
so it can progress to the next computation.
