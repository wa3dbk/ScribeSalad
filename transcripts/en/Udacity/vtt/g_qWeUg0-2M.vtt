00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.778
You can figure out how many t-tests we need by brute force. We would need one

00:00:05.778 --> 00:00:13.281
between A and B, A and C, A and D, B and C, et cetera. Then, you see that we

00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:17.245
need six t-tests. As you can see, the number of t-tests we would have to do

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:21.886
does not equal the number of samples we want to compare. We have to do even

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:26.971
more t-tests. You don't have to know this but the way to figure out how many

00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:33.763
t-tests we would have to do with n samples, is found be choosing 2 out of n.

00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:38.499
This is the symbolic notation for that, which is equal to n factorial divided

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:45.951
by two factorial, since 2 is here, times n minus two factorial. So, for example

00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:50.263
if we want to compare 10 samples, the number of t test we would do is 10

00:00:50.263 --> 00:00:57.890
factorial divided by 2 factorial, times 8 factorial. Remember that factorial

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.530
means 10 times 9 times 8 times 7, et cetera, all the way to one, divided by 2

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.082
times 1, for 2 factorial, times 8 factorial. These parts cancel out and we're

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:18.522
left with 10 times 9 divided by 2, which is 45. We would have to do 45 t-tests

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:23.900
just to compare 10 samples. We want something a lot simpler.
