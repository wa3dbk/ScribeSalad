00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.070
Of all the Android launch devices,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.920
the Nexus 1 will always 
hold a special place in my heart.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.860
That's not to take anything away 
from my first Android device,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.810
the HTC G1, that launched Android 
to the world with its distinctive chin

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.930
and slide-out keyboard.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.320
Or the HTC Magic, 
first prerelease android phone

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.520
I got to dog food
when I joined Google.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.430
And the first, the wave of devices
we gave every attendee

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.320
starting at Google I/O in 2009.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.180
2010 was the year Android went from 
"that's interesting" to global phenomenon.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.510
Growing from 100,000 
activations a day in May,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.070
to over 300,000 by December.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.310
That was seriously helped 
by the release of the Motorola Droid.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.850
I can still remember 
the offices here in Building 44,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.780
echoing with the constant refrain
of "Droid" as each device rebooted.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.660
The Droid was the first of the thinner, 
higher res, more powerful Android devices

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.960
that have since become standard.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.510
And it was also the device whose 
release on Verizon here in the U.S.,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.400
really kicked off the flood 
of Android activations.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.810
But I was a Londoner then,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.096
and the Droid was
a [inaudible] only phone,

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:06.842
so it was never really
a device I truly used.

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:10.620
Then, there was the Nexus 1, 
code-named Passion.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.160
The first device I felt was pure Android,
was also the phone we brought with us

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.990
on our 2010 Android 
Developer Labs World Tour.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.280
Me and my colleagues 
traveled across the world.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.040
Seven cities in ten days,
introducing over 20,000 developers

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.450
to Android by way of presentations
and a free Nexus 1.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.560
As a result, I made
a lot of friends across Europe,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.890
and learned exactly 
how many boxes of phones

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.530
I can carry across snow drifts 
in Stockholm, and icy roads in Berlin.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.540
Since then, The Nexus S4 and 5
have each improved on what it takes

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.610
to make a great Android phone.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.820
And OEMs across the world, have created
thousands of different Android devices.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.483
Starting with the Motorola Xoom,

00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:54.306
which led Android's 
official expansion into tablet's,

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:57.030
and leading the way 
for the Nexus 7 and 10.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.830
But that was just the start.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.590
Those changes paved the way 
for the Android [inaudible]

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.990
to grow into what could be, 
the brains behind anything

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.870
from phones and tablet's, to TVs, 
cars and wearables, like Android Wear.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.940
It's impossible to know, what comes next.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.950
Who knows?

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:15.771
Maybe the next Android devices, 
will be Androids themselves.
