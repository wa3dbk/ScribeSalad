00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.882
Simplifying variables underneath a radical works the same way as it does for

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:08.534
factors, or just numbers. We'll look at simplifying the cubed root of x to the

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:12.882
fourth times y to the sixth. Keep in mind that these variables actually

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:17.890
represent numbers, like x could equal 2 and y could be 3. Our rules for these

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.245
won't change, we'll still apply the product rule if we can, and we can only

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:26.601
remove factors if they repeat three times. For example, we can split this up

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:32.231
into the cube root of x times x times x times x. These four xs are the same as

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:36.902
x to the fourth. Similarly, our second radical will have the cube root of y to

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:41.128
the sixth. Since our x variable repeats three times, we you can pull one of

00:00:41.128 --> 00:00:44.314
them out, we can also pull out one y from these three, and one y from these

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:50.234
three. This x however is a little bit lonely, it doesn't have three of itself,

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:56.110
so we leave it inside the cube root. So our final answer is x times y squared

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.400
time the cube root of x. So in order to simplify any radical we want to take

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.656
the radican and split it up into its factors. If a factor appears the same

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:10.500
number of times as the index of the root, then that means we can pull one of it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.895
out. That was why we could pull out one x, one y and one y. We multiply all

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:20.738
those factors together and leave any single or lonely factors inside of the

00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:24.823
radical. This will give us our final answer.
