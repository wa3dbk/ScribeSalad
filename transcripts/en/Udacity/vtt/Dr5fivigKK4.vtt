00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
For this problem we’ve been tasked with finding

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.286
the longest common substring. The longest common

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.947
substring is going to be the longest

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:13.113
substring found in two or more given strings.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.733
Let’s go through an example and be pretty clear.

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.869
So here referring two words that I’m not going

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.141
to pronounce and if you look closely the longest

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.633
sequence of characters that they’ve in common

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.728
can be found right here APACH. There is no

00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:30.068
other substring longer than five characters

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:33.674
found in both words. And in this problem

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:36.236
we need to find the length of the longest common

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:41.009
substring. So in this case it would be five

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:42.969
. So when I ease solution to this problem,

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.426
which should be really, really slow if we

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:48.892
calculate every single possible substring in

00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:51.820
one word and check if its contained in the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.488
other word. So I would start with T, then I might

00:00:54.488 --> 00:01:00.609
do TA and then I might do AP, PA, AC, etcetera,

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.642
etcetera and then I go to three letters and four

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:04.873
letters and five letters and so on. And

00:01:04.873 --> 00:01:06.915
each time I would check if it’s in the other word.

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.751
If it is in the other word, I would check to see

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.350
if it’s the longest substring I’ve found so far.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.401
And I would update it. So this is pretty slow.

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.634
We’re going to do something a little different.

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:20.037
We’re going to write three functions. The first

00:01:20.037 --> 00:01:24.435
function C suffix, finds the longest common suffix

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:27.382
. So given two words, like the ones we have here,

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:30.005
the longest common suffix would be either the

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.822
empty string or none. That mean there is no suffix

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:35.255
they have in common. But if we ignored,

00:01:35.255 --> 00:01:38.428
the last few characters let’s say we had this,

00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:42.522
the longest common suffix is going to be APACH.

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:44.853
So we’re going to find a function that finds a

00:01:44.853 --> 00:01:48.036
suffix, which is going to be a step in the direction

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:50.578
of finding the more general longest common

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:52.568
substring. The second function we are going

00:01:52.568 --> 00:01:55.791
to write creates a risk of all the prefixes for a

00:01:55.791 --> 00:02:00.025
given string. So if we take in a word say,

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:03.077
CAT and calculate the prefixes of CAT, we

00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:06.567
will get a list exactly like this one. Notice

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:08.553
that if there are three characters in the input

00:02:08.553 --> 00:02:11.448
string, the list is going to be of length three.

00:02:11.448 --> 00:02:14.416
And the last function is going to find the length

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:16.924
of the longest common substring. The way we’re

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:20.872
going to do that is by finding the largest common

00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:24.216
suffix of all the prefixes. So we’re going to go

00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:26.606
through each prefix, calculate the largest

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:29.107
common suffix, and then keep track of the

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.295
largest one we found and the length of the largest

00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:34.980
common suffix of all the prefixes quite an

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.092
awful is going to be the longest common substring.

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:42.128
So let’s get coding this. So ever in my function

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:46.241
decoration for the common suffix. And one thing

00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:48.858
that was noted in a hint is that we’re probably

00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:52.202
going to want to cash the results of this function

00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:55.970
in a chart to save time and be more efficient.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.441
So let’s create that chart and then we’re

00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:00.394
going to check in the first line of our function

00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:02.304
whether or not we can reuse a value that we’ve

00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:06.595
already calculated. This is called memoisation.

00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:09.922
So here I make sure that X and Y are in the empty

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:13.357
string and if they aren’t I’m going to check the C

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:16.894
if the last value in each string is matching. If

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:20.592
they do match, my total length of the common

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:23.392
suffix is going to increase by one because the

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:25.960
last characters match. And then I’m going to

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.626
recursively call C suffix on everything, but

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:33.041
the last character in the string. So five CAT

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.603
and HAT, the first recursive call is going

00:03:35.603 --> 00:03:39.271
to check the T in CAT and the T in HAT.

00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:42.579
We’re going to see are they match at one and then

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.095
recurse on CAT and HAT do the same thing? Recurse

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:51.972
in C and H were not going to find a match, so

00:03:51.972 --> 00:03:54.803
we’re going to return the answer. And of course

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:57.142
we have to remember to update our chart if we did

00:03:57.142 --> 00:04:00.803
find the answer. And that’s the common suffix.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:04.174
let's move on to the next one and as spoiler each

00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:06.223
of the remaining functions is exactly one line

00:04:06.223 --> 00:04:09.273
long. So here is the code for a prefixes function

00:04:09.273 --> 00:04:12.252
. As a reminder, it takes in a string and outputs

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:16.599
a list of all the prefixes for that string. So

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.039
let’s take a look at this output. Given an input

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.914
of CAT we have C, CA, CAT. If we are going to

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:28.072
relate this to our code, CAT is X and we want to

00:04:28.072 --> 00:04:31.234
see what substring operations we can do on X

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:35.086
to get these strings. So here we’re going to

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:38.418
return everything from index 0, remember its

00:04:38.418 --> 00:04:42.616
0-1-2 to 1, not including the 1. So it’s just

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.299
going to be the first the 0 character. If we

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:47.249
increment that by 1, we’re going to get the

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.859
Increment by 1 again and we get the T

00:04:50.859 --> 00:04:53.612
. And so what this was comprehension does

00:04:53.612 --> 00:04:57.315
is it goes from 0 to the length of X, so

00:04:57.315 --> 00:05:00.097
its going to go from 0 to 2 and we’re going to

00:05:00.097 --> 00:05:02.633
take the substring from the beginning all

00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:06.301
the way to I plus 1, so its going to go to

00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:10.300
1-2-3, just like we have here. Pretty simple.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.647
So given our two functions we’re going to rate L

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:17.071
substring. And as I said before, this is going to

00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:22.363
be the maximum length of the common suffixes for

00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:25.945
all the prefixes both X and Y. If you didn’t

00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:27.633
follow along the code, it’s probably going to be

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:30.585
clear. So here I’m taking the maximum of the list

00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:34.097
generated by this comprehension and what we’re

00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:38.266
going to do is find every combination to prefixes

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:41.595
for X and Y together, find the common suffix of

00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:44.821
them and the maximum of that list is going to be

00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:48.381
the longest common substring of the entire word.And

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:52.381
that is how you find the longest common substring.
