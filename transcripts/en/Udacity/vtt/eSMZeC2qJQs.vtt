00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.364
This time, it's our x coordinate that changes. The y coordinate stays the same,

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:08.900
but the x coordinate becomes negative x instead of x. We can see this happening

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.764
in our graph. All the y values of these corresponding points are the same, but

00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:17.050
their x values have been made negative, since we flipped across the y axis.
