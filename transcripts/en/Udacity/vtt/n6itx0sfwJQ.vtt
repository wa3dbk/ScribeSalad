&gt;&gt; Much like loading the map data parameters itself, loading from the tile sets

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:06.927
is pretty straight forward. All you have to do is create a new object and set

00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:10.657
its properties equal to those that are defined in the map objects. For example,

00:00:10.657 --> 00:00:14.432
first GID, image height, image width, name, etc. You'll also notice that we pass

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:17.942
off the image parameter to the one that we actually just loaded in the previous

00:00:17.942 --> 00:00:22.024
quiz. We also commute the number of x and y tiles for this atlas by dividing its

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:25.555
width and height by the tile size defined in the global map object.
