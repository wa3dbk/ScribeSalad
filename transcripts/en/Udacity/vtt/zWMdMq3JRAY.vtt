00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.580
But what if we wanted to rationalize the denominator that looked like this. If

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.346
we multiplied our original fraction by the root of 7 divided by the root of 7.

00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:12.798
We would still wind up with a radical in our denominator. So this wouldn't

00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:16.752
work. Keep in mind, when we're multiplying, we would just distribute this root

00:00:16.752 --> 00:00:21.311
7 to each of these terms, to get 7 minus root 35. Likewise, if we were to

00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:24.914
multiply by the root of 5 divided by the root of 5. We would still get an

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.944
expression that contained a radical in our denominator. And that's no good. So

00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:33.535
we need a different way to be able to simplify this denominator so it doesn't

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:35.803
contain these radicals.
