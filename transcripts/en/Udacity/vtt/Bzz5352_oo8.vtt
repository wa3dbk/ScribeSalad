00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.060
In astronomy, the attitude is the vertical angle, and the azimuth is the angle

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.524
around the horizon. You're job is to add another slider to also very the

00:00:06.524 --> 00:00:10.397
altitude angle of the light. To get it right you'll have to take into account

00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:12.762
that the x and z components need to be scaled down as the y component

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:17.848
increases. So that the direction is normalized. In other words, the light

00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:21.845
direction should be x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals 1. Another

00:00:21.845 --> 00:00:25.475
handy formula you'll find is that, the cosine squared plus sine squared equals

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:28.698
1. When you're done, the light should now operate with altitude and azimuth

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:32.232
angles. Another way to think about is that altitude is similar to latitude on

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.990
earth, azimuth is similar to the longitude.
