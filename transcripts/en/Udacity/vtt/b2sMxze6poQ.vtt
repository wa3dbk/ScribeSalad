Regular Android applications
use the Notification API to

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.290
show important information to
the user on phones and tablet's.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.030
One of the most important features of
Android Wear is the ability to take

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.150
these notifications, and
show them to the user on their wrist.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.129
In this lesson,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.160
I'm going to show you how notifications
are shown on Android Wear.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.920
And how easy it is to extend this
code to look great on wearables.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.770
So let's get started.
