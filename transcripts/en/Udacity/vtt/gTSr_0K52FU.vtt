00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.940
After all these talking about requirements, let's have a small quiz, I

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.019
want to ask you which of the

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.840
following requirements are non-functional requirements? And here

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.860
I'm listing the requirements, the first one says at the BowlingAlley program

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.420
keeps track of the score during a game, the second one is that

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.720
the WordCount program should be able to process large files. The third

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.580
one is that the Login program for a website. Should be secure, and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.880
finally the last one says that the vending machine program should take coins

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.430
as an input from the user. So, I want you to mark all

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.590
the ones that are non-functional requirements, that

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.640
don't refer to the functionality of the system.
