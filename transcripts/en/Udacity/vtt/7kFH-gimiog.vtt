00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.720
Now that we found that 2 over 6 is a zero of this function, does that mean that

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.650
one of it's factors is 6x minus 2? Please tell me yes if you agree that this

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.200
follows the pattern of previous relationships between zeros and factors, or

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.400
tell me no if you think that the fact that 6x minus 2 is divisible by 2 But 6x

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.589
cubed minus 17x squared plus 11x minus 2, is not as a problem.
