We actually have a bunch of pairs of faces that have the same area. Each face

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:08.887
has the same area as the one opposite it. So we have two faces whose area is 3x

00:00:08.887 --> 00:00:15.072
times 2x. Two that are 3x times x plus 10. And another two that are 2x times x

00:00:15.072 --> 00:00:20.504
plus 10x. Let's multiply all of this out. After a few steps of simplification,

00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:25.073
we end up with a surface area of 22x squared plus 100x.
