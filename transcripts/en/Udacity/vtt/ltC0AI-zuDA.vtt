00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.760
In this course, we have learned about a large number of reasoning methods.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.220
Here are some of them. We could have added a lot more here, for example,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.790
plan refinement or logic or scripts. Typically when you and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.290
I program an AI agent, we pick a method, and we program that

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.640
method into the agent. One unanswered question is, how might an agent know about

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.580
all of these methods and the autonomously select the right method for

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.260
a given problem? This is the problem of strategy selection and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.942
metacognition helps with strategy selection. Given a problem, and given that all

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:36.171
of these matters are relative to the agent to potentially address problem.

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:40.830
Metacognition is select between these matters using several criteria.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.825
First, each of these methods require some knowledge of the world. For example,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.320
case-based reasoning requires knowledge of cases.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.110
Constraint propagation requires knowledge of constraint. And so

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.860
on. Metacognition is select one particular method, depending on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.610
what knowledge is exactly available for addressing that specific input problem.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.330
If that specific input problem, case does not have a label, then clearly

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.520
the method of case-based reasoning cannot be used. If, on the other hand,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.870
constraints are available, the constraint propagation might be a useful method.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.350
Second, if the knowledge required by multiple methods is available, then

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.190
metacognition must select between the competing methods. Under the criteria for

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.830
selecting between these methods might be computational efficiency.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.440
For a given class of problems, some of these methods might be

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.390
computationally more efficient than other methods. As an example,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.640
if the problem is very close to a previously encountered case, then a case-based

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.890
reasoning might be computationally a very good method to use. On the other hand,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.970
if the new problem is very different from a previously encountered case,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.430
then case-based reasoning may not be a computationally efficient method.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.140
We've come across this issue of computational efficiency earlier in this class.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.900
For example, when we were discussing generate and

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.330
test. If the problem is simple, then it is potentially possible to

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.400
write a generator that will produce good solutions to it. On the other hand, for

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.760
a very complex problem, the process of generating good solutions may be

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.300
computationally inefficient. Similarly, if there is a single goal,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.630
then the method of means-ends analysis may be a good choice. On the other hand,

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.880
if there are multiple goals that are interacting with each other,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.860
the means-ends analysis can run into all kind of cul-de-sacs, and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.270
have poor computational efficiency. A third criteria that metacognition can

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.340
use to select between these various methods is quality of solutions.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.380
Some methods come with guarantees of quality of solutions. For example,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.410
logic is a method of provide some guarantees of the correctness of solutions.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.380
Thus, if this is a problem for which computational efficiency is not important,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.960
where the quality of solutions is critical, you might want to use the method of

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.050
logic. Because it provides some guarantees of the quality, although it

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.480
might be computationally inefficient. The same kind of analysis holds for

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.110
selecting between different learning methods. Once again,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.140
given a problem, the agent may have multiple learning methods for

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.120
addressing their particular problem. What method should the learning agent

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.200
choose? That depends partly on the nature of the problem.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.120
Some methods are applicable to that problem, and some methods may not be

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.940
applicable to that problem. Second, for example, in this learning task,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.900
if the examples come in one at a time we might use incremental concept learning.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.245
On the other hand, if all the examples are given together, then we might use

00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:13.000
decision-tree learning or identification-tree learning. Another criteria for

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.100
deciding between these methods could be computational efficiency that

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.550
lay down what the criteria could have to do with quality of solutions.
