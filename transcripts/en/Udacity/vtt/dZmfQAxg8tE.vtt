00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.696
We start out number puzzle by multiplying 5 and 2, which equals 10. 7 is the x

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:10.000
term, so that goes into the bottom. We want to find a factor pair of 10 that

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.044
sums to 7. That must be 2 and 5. We can rewrite the 7x as positive 2x and

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:21.198
positive 5x. Now we'll use factoring by grouping to finish out our problem. From

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:26.111
the first two terms I can factor out an x, leaving me with 5x plus 2. The second

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:31.126
two terms are a little bit tricky. They don't share a factor of 5, of x or 2,

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:36.526
but they do share a factor of 1. We can always factor out a 1 if it appears that

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:42.805
two terms do not have common factors. Our final factored form is x plus 1 times

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:46.520
5x plus 2. I want to acknowledge that there's other ways to factor this. You

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.530
might have switched the 5x and the 2x and then continued factoring by grouping.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.650
That would work as well. As a quick check on the end, we can do some mental math

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.802
to make sure this factored form is equal to this polynomial. X times 5x is 5x

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:08.894
squared, 1 times 5x is 5x. And x times 2 is 2x. If I add 5x and 2x together,

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:14.113
I'll get 7x. And finally, 1 times 2 is positive 2.
