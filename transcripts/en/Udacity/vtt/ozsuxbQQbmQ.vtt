00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.372
As you can see, sound is a really important part of any project, especially

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:05.685
games.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:09.984
&gt;&gt; Take for example Half Life 2. Someone out there actually made an entire mod

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:13.170
pack to replace the sounds of the original game. So, instead of hearing

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.730
footsteps you heard duck quacks, instead of hearing the missile hitting the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.760
alien, you actually heard a crowd laughing. The result was pretty offsetting.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.608
You didn't really feel like you were connected in the environment. The drama

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:25.405
was gone, the suspense was gone, it really wasn't the same game.

00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:27.885
&gt;&gt; Now it's also worth pointing out, that sound design is often one of the more

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:32.417
expensive parts of production. It's long, tedious work, and often tied very

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:37.025
closely to the design of the game. Take for example Quake one, when your quad

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:39.815
damage was running out, the designer decided that you'd get a three second

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:44.775
pulse warning you that it was about to run out. Now if you actually look at the

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:49.080
code, they coded in the bright flashes that you see, once every second.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.394
However, the sound itself was actually a three second clip with the pulses. If

00:00:53.394 --> 00:00:56.166
the artist of designers came back and actually decided they wanted a different

00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:00.350
length, shorter or longer, the sound would have to be started from scratch.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.166
This is why sound design is usally really expensive for video games, and left

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.106
to the end. Most of these changes happen very iteratively, so you have to end

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:08.220
up scrapping a lot of the work you've been doing.
