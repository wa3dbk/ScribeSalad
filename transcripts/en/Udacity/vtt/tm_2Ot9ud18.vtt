00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.508
Alright, so here's the question for you. We know we

00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:07.158
have 2DN, different possible instances we might see. That is

00:00:07.158 --> 00:00:09.462
two to the end, different ways we might assign different

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:12.640
values to the attributes. But, that still doesn't tell us how

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.690
many decision trees we may have, or how many different

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.526
functions we might have. So, if we have 2DN rows, here's

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:21.320
my question. How many different ways might we fill out.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.280
This column over here of outputs? Remember, an output can be

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.750
either true or false. Go.
