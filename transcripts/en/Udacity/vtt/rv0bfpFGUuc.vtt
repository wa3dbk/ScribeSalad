00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.670
We're going to make an app with
three different text fields.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.880
Each embellishes text in
its own way as you type.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.130
Our goal is to use delegates to create
many different customized behaviors

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.060
using just one view.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.500
The first turns the words cat,
dog and fish into emojis.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.810
The second sets the text color to
be a combination of color words

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.690
used in the text.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.600
And the third is related to
a label which keeps a character

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.040
count as you type.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.130
For all three, the text field
views themselves look the same.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.010
They're used directly off the shelf
as written by Apple engineers.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.800
The differences in their behavior
come entirely from delegates.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.710
A delegate is an object that executes
a group of methods on behalf of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.140
another object.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.240
The ability to reuse views
without needing to subclass and

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.910
modify them is an important goal of all
graphical user interface libraries.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.890
We want view classes to be used as is,
and then we want control and

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.420
model classes to have the freedom
to customize those views.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.030
The delegate pattern allows for this.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.135
Let's look at some
examples of view reuse and

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:07.305
customization in the apps
we use everyday.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:09.185
Here in Safari,

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.285
you can see a text field that was
designed specifically for searching.

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:15.335
It has custom completion and

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:18.230
is often presented with a table
view of search results.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.010
If we look in settings, we see a table
that uses the same view class as

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.900
the search tables, but they look and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.660
feel pretty different and present
content in a different structure.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.490
How does the delegate pattern
enable the same view classes

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.300
to serve such different functions?
