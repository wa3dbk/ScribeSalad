Let's keep solving equations. When we're doing that, we can add, we can

00:00:04.306 --> 00:00:08.877
subtract, we can multiply, we can divide, or we can even do other operations.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.651
But whatever we do, we have to keep one rule in mind. No matter what, we have to

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:18.325
do the same operation to both sides of the equation. If we don't do this, we're

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:22.940
going to change the initial relationship that we started out with between our

00:00:22.952 --> 00:00:28.122
quantities. And the answer we get in the end, won't work with that equation.

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:32.289
Let's start out with a pretty simple example, x plus 3 equals 12. Then, I'm

00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:36.582
going to draw two boxes down here, one for each side of the equation. And in

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:41.001
each box, I would like you to write what step you think should happen next, to

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:45.096
change either side of our equation, so we can eventually get x by itself.

00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:49.430
For now though, we're just going to write this one step in. So, for example, if

00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:53.625
you think that we should add 8 to the right-hand side, then write plus 8 in the

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:57.700
box on the right. Or if you think we should divide by 2 on the left-hand side,

00:00:57.797 --> 00:01:02.803
please write a slash and 2, to symbolize divide by 2. Please remember that if

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:07.558
you want to symbolize multiplication, do not use an x, rather use the star

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.849
symbol and then, of course, whatever number you want.
