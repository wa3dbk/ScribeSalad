00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.731
&gt;&gt; This distribution is not symmetrical, it's skewed, &gt;&gt; With most incomes

00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:10.006
falling toward the left of the distribution. &gt;&gt; The most common household income

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:15.196
is here, which is less than $25,000 per year. &gt;&gt; We can also say that most

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:22.188
households make less than 100,000. &gt;&gt; If you see here, it says 95% of households

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:28.576
make less than 166,000, and 80% of households make less than 91,705. &gt;&gt; So,

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:34.946
somewhere between 80% and 95% of households make less than $100,000, which is

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:40.191
most of them. &gt;&gt; We cannot say, though, that no households have an income

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:46.059
greater than $250,000. &gt;&gt; 98% have less than $250,000, which must mean that 2%

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.080
of households have an income greater than $250,000.
