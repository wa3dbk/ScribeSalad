00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.522
We're finally at the point where you get to do an exercise and do some

00:00:02.522 --> 00:00:05.832
programming. To make our ornament, or defensive device to stop the

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:10.053
robo-minotaurs from destroying all things good and just, we need to rotate each

00:00:10.053 --> 00:00:14.209
cylinder into position. We have all the data we need for a cylinder. The axis of

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.824
rotation, the angle of rotation, and the length of the cylinder. First we create

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:23.402
a cylinder. Using the previously computed cylinder length for its height. Here's

00:00:23.402 --> 00:00:27.280
the code that actually sets up the access angle rotation matrix. For the axis

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.930
angle rotation function, we need to pass in a normalized axis at an angle in

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.518
radiants. This function could normalize the axis itself, just to be safe.

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.355
However, for efficiency's sake, it doesn't, so we normalize the axis earlier

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:45.960
here. Next we do an obscure thing. Set matrix auto update to false. This

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.810
parameter is true by default. What it means is that, if true then our objects 3D

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.482
matrix will be computed from its position, rotation and scale parameters. By

00:00:55.482 --> 00:01:00.839
setting it to false we tell 3JS that we are not going to use these parameters.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.676
But rather are going to set the matrix itself directly. And that's exactly what

00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:10.275
we do in the next line, where we at long last finally call the matrix rotation

00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:14.829
axis method. Giving it our normalized axis and angle. At long last we have added

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.951
a cylinder at the proper angle and length to our seam. Now it's your turn to

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:24.183
finish off the rest. Add another three cylinders to complete this object.
