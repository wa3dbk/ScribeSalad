Hi, I'm Richard,
a course developer at Udacity.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.490
After reviewing some of the feedback for
this course,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.180
Cameron asked me to help him add
an additional lesson on jQuery events.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.510
So here we are.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.250
Events give you the power to
set up automatic responses

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.490
based on what your users do
when they're on your page.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.660
In this short lesson, we'll be taking
a look at how browser events can help

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.870
develop interactive websites.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.090
You'll be doing this by listening for
and reacting to events.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.500
Now you can do this with no
libraries at all, but for

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.120
simplicity we'll be using
jQuery in this course.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.840
Ready to get started?
