00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.016
So, let's now add in news case number 3.

00:00:03.016 --> 00:00:04.260
Brewing is complete.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.380
And started it up, its going and maybe the user pulled the pot or stuck

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.410
it back in or whatever, but we eventual got to the end, brewing is complete.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.980
So, in this case, what, what, what steps do you expect to have happened.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.810
&gt;&gt; So at this point we could assume that there should be coffee in the pot.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.990
And if there's coffee in the pot, then we have that warmer plate that needs to

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.900
be activated to keep the coffee warm.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.370
But I guess there's also the switch, the situation like you mentioned, the cup,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.400
the pot could have been removed and then it's replaced.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.750
So we got to do the check to see If,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.970
I guess, there's still coffee there in the pot after brewing is complete.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.610
But the boiler needs to be turned off, we're no longer boiling.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.180
The water source is not really relevant anymore either.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.910
I guess we need to somehow maybe prohibit our, well,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.230
I guess you could start brewing again but.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.560
I don't think that's an issue, I think I, I jumped to that being an issue, but

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.000
I don't think it is.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.140
And then we need to turn on the light to say hey, there's coffee ready.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.270
&gt;&gt; So we got that light there, so

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.880
we need to inform the user interface as to where the light lives.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.950
So the one other thing that needs to go on is the containment vessel needs to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.090
be informed because it keeps track of how much coffee remains in the pot.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.240
And at the very start, the pot is full and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.480
so it has to be told that the pot is full.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.210
So there's a lot of messages and checks that have to go on here.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.020
Let's let's add those into the diagram as well.
