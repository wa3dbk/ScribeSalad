00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.450
In the last quiz I asked you to
modify a bunch of things in your app.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.640
You may not have understood what
you were doing, but that's okay.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.430
We're going to talk about it now.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.970
Specifically, we're going to talk
about resources in your app.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.700
Resources live under the res
directory of your app.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.230
Res is short for resources.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.960
On the other hand,
java files live in the java folder.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.830
And we have MainActivity.java
located inside this folder.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.970
An Android app is mainly made
of resources and java code.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.860
The java code consists of
files like MainActivity.java.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.900
Altogether it handles what should
happen when the app is running

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.939
like responding to button clicks or
other events.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.920
Then you have resources that live
in the res directory of your app.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.870
This includes images, text strings,
colors, dimensions, like for

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.150
width and height,
xml files like for menus and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.740
layouts, as well as raw media
files like for audio or video.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.660
One of the major advantages to
separating out the java code and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.640
the resources is that we can
provide alternative resources

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.500
to make the app look
better on certain devices.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.110
So if we want a different layout
on larger screen devices,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.830
we can provide that by
just swapping it out.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.220
Or, if we want to translate these
strings into another language,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.940
then it makes it easier to swap out the
strings in just the centralized location

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.310
instead of having it scattered
all over the code files.
