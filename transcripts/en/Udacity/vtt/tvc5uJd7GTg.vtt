What if I add a line to the bottom of this program? What do you think will

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:08.758
happen if I try to compile this code and run it? Will the code compile? Will

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:14.260
there be an error? What age of kitten would trigger this return statement?

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:21.065
Let's try it, the code won't compile. It says unreachable statement. Every

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:25.982
possible branch of this if else statement has a return statement already. Once

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:31.004
it returns the answer it won't do anymore. It'll exit the method. Even if there

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:36.085
might be more code further down. Java can recognize certain situations where

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:39.790
there might be unreachable code and it warns you because unreachable code is a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.796
mistake. When I write this line, I'm coding for a case that can never happen.

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:50.752
All the cases are handled and finished in the if else statement. The else picks

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:55.199
up all of the left overs. So, I shouldn't have an extra line at the end of my

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.319
program that pretends it might return the cutest kitten of all..
