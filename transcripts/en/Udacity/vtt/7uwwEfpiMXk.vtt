00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.230
So let's look at the AMAT equation
when we have a cache hierarchy.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.980
The AMAT is still equal
to L1 hit time plus

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.200
the L1 miss rate times the L1 miss
penalty, but it used to stop here and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.405
the L1 miss penalty would simply
be the memory access time.

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:25.010
But now we have that the L1
miss penalty is the L2 hit time

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.544
plus the L2 miss rate times
the L2 miss penalty and

00:00:30.544 --> 00:00:35.500
the L2 miss penalty is the L3
hit time plus the level 3

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.930
miss rate times the level 3 miss
penalty and so on until at some point,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.980
we have a cache whose miss
penalty is equal to the main

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.820
memory latencies because there
is no more caches beneath it.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.270
This cache whose misses go
directly to memory is called

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.250
the last level cache, or LLC.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.890
So it used to be that the L1 cache was
the only cache, so L1 cache was the LLC.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.748
Then level 2 cache's were introduced so

00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:14.650
level 2 miss penalty was the main
number latency because level

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.085
2 went directly to memory and
that was the last level cache and

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:23.405
then level 3 cache's were introduced so
they became the LLC and so on.
