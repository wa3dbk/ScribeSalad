00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.680
Let's start with what a request is.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.260
It's actually pretty useful to imagine the internet as a bunch of

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.690
people who are just simply sending messages back and forth.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.840
For this example, I'll be the client,

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.370
which means that I'm actually a browser like Chrome or Firefox.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.239
Jessica represents the internet.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.660
She is the middleman and will be passing information back and forth.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.410
And Ben here is the server, which means that he's computer dedicated to

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.050
providing content to browsers like me.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.750
If I want something from Ben, I'll send a get request to him.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.310
A get request is a message that tells him who I am and what I want.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.778
So, got my message, Jessica takes it and passes it to Ben.

00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:42.520
Ben, the server, looks at my message and then sends back what I requested.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.970
This is called a response.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.150
I can open the response and then do something with it.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.170
In order for a website to open, it performs many requests for

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.190
data, like Ben and I are doing right now.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.510
Most of the time, the response is critical for the page to load.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.010
For instance, I must have Ben's HTML to load the page and the CSS to lay it out.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.834
Thank you very much.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.184
When your browser makes a request synchronously, or

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:16.070
without AJAX, it has to wait for responses before proceeding with the load.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.130
AJAX is special because it allows these types of requests

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.300
asynchronously, which means that they can happen in the background without

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.500
blocking the rest of the page load.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.550
Let's take this analogy just a little bit further.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.240
Let's imagine I send off a get request to Ben, but I've got some plans in

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.720
mind for what I want to do with it when the response gets back.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.970
So, when I send off the request, I will take the instructions and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.550
set them aside for myself.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.730
And they'll patiently wait right here.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.160
And now, I'm free to go off and work on other tasks.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.170
When Ben's response eventually gets back, I'll open up the response,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.590
take a look at my instructions, and then do something with them.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.660
These instructions that I set aside are called a callback,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.970
in that I call them when I get a response back.
