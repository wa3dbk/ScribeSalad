00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.610
Because of the tragic effects of the lobotomy and its over use, today's psycho

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.392
surgeries are only used, as a last resource after all other therapies are

00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:14.058
proven to be uneffective. ECT is administered by passing electric current

00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:18.384
through the brain in a order to induce a seizure. And ECT is administered by

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:22.056
placing electrodes on the head, and passing that electrical current through for

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:28.548
approximately one third to half a second. And the voltage ranges between 60 and

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:32.950
140 volts. Now this voltage is not lethal because it's delivered to the head,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.295
however, if that voltage were delivered to the chest it would be lethal. Early

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:41.943
in its use, ECT often produced fractures, because a person was experiencing

00:00:41.943 --> 00:00:47.822
seizure and convulsions. Therefore, today patients are given a muscle relaxant

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:53.173
and an anesthetic, before the ECT is administered. Thus what was once a violent

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:57.199
procedure due to the convulsions, shaking, and broken bones, now only results

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.636
in a slight tremor because of the muscle relaxant. Now, it may typically take

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:05.710
at least six to 12 sessions at ECT, before a person is relieved of their

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.620
depressive symptoms. In addition, after ECT treatment, many patients are

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.020
relieved of their depressive symptoms, which they did not experience with other

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.475
treatments. Now the exact mechanism of action or cause of why ECT is effective,

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:23.450
is still not known and research continues in that area.
