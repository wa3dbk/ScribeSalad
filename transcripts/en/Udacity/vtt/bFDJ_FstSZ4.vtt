00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.814
&gt;&gt; Here are samples of size 10 from each of these distributions. So I'm going to

00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:09.495
find the first quartile, which we'll henceforth call Q1 for the general

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:14.611
population. And I'm also going to find the third quartile, which we'll call Q3.

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:19.171
First, let's split the data in half. So we have five values above, and five

00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:26.042
values below. Then we find, essentially, the median of this half, which is

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:33.309
38,801. So this is Q1, the value of the first quartile. And then we find the

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:40.770
median of the second half, which is 56,863. So this is Q3 and the median we'll

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.992
call Q2. And our new range, then, will be the distance between Q1 and Q3. So

00:00:46.992 --> 00:00:53.010
18,062, then, is our new range, when we cut off the upper and lower tails. Or

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.196
the upper and lower 25%. So now, how 'bout you do the same for this one. Cut off

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:05.414
the upper and lower 25%. This one is Mark Zuckerberg. And then let's find the

00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:09.995
range between Q1 and Q3. Put your answer here in the box.
