00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.705
And continuing through this debugger statement,

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:05.430
we should have a map drawn on our page.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.740
As you can see here, we have a map of the world.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.382
And while there's a few quirks, in this case Greenland and

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:16.950
then top of the Northern Hemisphere slightly cut off, and Antarctica is huge,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.040
we've drawn an SVG map

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.210
of all the countries in the world with just a few lines of D3 in JavaScript.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.700
This is quite an accomplishment.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.770
To better position our map,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.600
we can use the scale and translate functions on the projection.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.330
These both allow us to move and manipulate the visual display of the map.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.160
Think of scale as similar to the plus and

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.650
minus zoom buttons on something like Google Maps, and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.490
translate as dragging the center of the map to a different location.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.540
In our case, we're setting the scale to be 170,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.200
and we're translating the center of our map to be half the width and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.590
half the height of our SVG element already on the page.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.820
I encourage you to play around with the values of scale and translate to really

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.060
understand how they effect the visual map that our reader looks at.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.700
If we then reload the page, we can see here that our map has been centered and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.430
has been zoomed out slightly so

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.330
that we can see all of the Northern Hemisphere and still all of Antarctica.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.030
For the rest of this lesson, I'm going to translate the map down so

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.690
that Antarctica gets cut off since it's not in any World Cup games.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.980
And the important parts of the map for us, in this case the participating

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.960
countries in the World Cup, will be a bit larger and easy to see.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.680
And the last change to make the map slightly more readable and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.460
a little bit more aesthetically pleasing,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.110
is to change the fill of the countries from black to udacity blue.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.680
In this case, to change the outline of each country border

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.650
to a darker black line and to make the stroke width slightly thinner so

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.660
we can see more detail in the borders of countries.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.130
Going back to the map, we can see here there all the countries are filled in

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.450
with blue, and the black stroke that's slightly thinner makes it

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.670
much easier to see the different countries on the map.
