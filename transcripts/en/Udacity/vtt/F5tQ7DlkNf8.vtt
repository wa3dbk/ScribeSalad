00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
Now, what is Rice's theorem?

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.310
Rice's theorem is actually quite simple.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.970
Rice's theorem simply says that if you asked for an algorithm

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.300
to decide the program has a functional property and it can be any functional property,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.210
then, you're looking at an undecidable problem.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.270
I don't even know, that come out of surprise to you

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.180
after we have shown that basically anything is undecidable.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.620
It's almost a surprise now that any problem on a computer

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.620
should even be solvable but we'll get into that in a minute.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.170
The main question, of course, how can you show Rice's theorem,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.550
and the proof that is actually easy and it follows the same scheme as above here.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.610
So the proof of this general statement

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.900
follows the same scheme that all of our other proofs of undecidability have basically used.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.050
So, again, we assumed that there is a program that can decide

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.800
for another program if that possesses a certain functional property.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.080
So we're given a program P again, any program P,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.290
and we assumed that no matter what P is,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.080
we can always say "does P have a functional property?"

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.550
Now, on the other side, assume that there is another program P',

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.769
and what we want to do is solve the halting problem for this program here

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.140
and then we'll use the algorithm here that can decide for any program P

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.180
if it has a functional property to solve the halting problem

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.090
and the way we do this is as follows:

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.300
We construct a new program we will call program X and this program has only 3 steps.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.440
First, it runs P' then it clears all of the memory,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.260
so basically a fresh start of a machine,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.010
and this is the only reason why we need this condition too here for a functional property

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.990
because if we have an algorithm that can decide a functional property,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.380
this means that there are some programs that has this property and others that don't.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.950
So, we will now add to our program X a program that has this functional property.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.610
So, run program with functional property,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.350
and what then do is we take this program X and fitted into this algorithm here.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.730
what you can see now is the following:

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.120
If P' here, the problem for which we want to solve the halting problem,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.490
runs smoothly and terminates,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.800
then this program X will have the functional property that we can decide

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.880
because it runs this algorithm here and it clears the memory

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.590
and then it runs the program with that functional property.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.280
This is also the reason why time is not a functional property.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.130
That would kind of destroy the proof of Rice's theorem.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.140
But if time is not an issue, then as long as P' finishes,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.880
the program X will have the functional property that we can decide here.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.210
If, on the other hand, P' goes into an infinite loop,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.580
then the program does not have the functional property

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.900
because it will never be able to reach these two lines here.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.580
So, deciding the functional property for this new program X here

00:02:36.580 --> 99:59:59.000
is the same as solving the halting problem for the original program that we started out.
