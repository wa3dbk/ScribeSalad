00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right, this time we're going to do just a tiny bit differently.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What we're going to do is we're going to search this graph starting from b

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we're going to mark as we go the order in which we've added things to the open list.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So, we started off with b, the only thing on the open list, we visit both the neighbors of b

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
add them to the open list, pull c off the open list, add it's neighbors d, b,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we work on d, take it off the open list, add its neighbors e and c.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, we can take e off the open list, add its neighbors f and, well this is already done.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Take f off the open list, add its neighbors g and this is already done.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Take g off the open list, its neighbors are all already done, nothing is added.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Take a off the open list, its neighbors are already done, okay, we're finished.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, I want you to do this starting from d and make a note of the numbers

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
as you add them and let me clean this up, okay.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I want you to try this just like I did starting from d this time and write the numbers underneath,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and when you're finished, when the search is completed,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
take whatever number you have under a, take whatever number you have under g,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
add them together, and put it in this box here.
