00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.501
The graph would be this purple circle. We know this since the radius would be

00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:09.608
4, which is the square root of 16. So out of all of the circles, we want the

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:15.360
smallest radius, that would be 4. Our center will be at 2, negative 1. We know

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.400
this since this sign is negative 2, so h is positive 2 and this sign is

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.646
positive 1, so k is negative 1. The large circles had a radius of 16 and that

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:33.358
would have been way too big. The next circles a size down had a radius of 8,

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:38.190
still too large. So, we were really choosing between the smallest 2 circles.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.038
And it's this one because its center is at 2, negative 1. And if we zoom in, we

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:50.386
can easily see that. The center is at 2, negative 1 here. Now, I know you

00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:53.460
didn't have this close up view for the circle, but the idea was to get an

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.238
estimate of which one you think it is. Based on the direction that the center

00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:03.567
moved and based on the size of the radius. Sometimes it's just as good to have

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:07.065
a qualitative understanding of about what your graph should look like, rather

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:10.980
than an exact picture. That's what we were going for with this question.
