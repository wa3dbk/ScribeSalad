00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is the first two. The first one is checking the signature.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're checking the signature here by decrypting using the public key

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that verifies that this message was created by someone who knows the private key

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so we verify the signature, and you might think that would be enough.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We verify the signature, we obtain the public key, and we obtain the value

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that we need to produce our Diffie-Hellman key.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The reason that's not enough is because we're also worried about replay attacks,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that's why we need to do the second check.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We're going to recompute this hash. Note that the hash is one way.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We can't use the hash to learn the key, but we can compute the key like this for the client

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and then check that the key and the hash matches that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
By computing the hash, we know that there is no replay attack because these values are fresh.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If there was a replay attack and a different hash value was replayed,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
then this hash wouldn't match, so we need both of those.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The third check doesn't make sense, and this uses Yc as well as Xs,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which is the secret value of the server.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If that was revealed, that would break the protocol.
