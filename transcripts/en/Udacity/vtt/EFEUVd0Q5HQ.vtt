00:00:00.151 --> 00:00:03.131
Now before we finish,
I want to actually now showcase you, yet

00:00:03.131 --> 00:00:05.491
another example of similar
coded photography.

00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:06.315
Except this time,

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.148
we're going to talk about the concept
of a flutter shutter camera.

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:12.025
The flutter shutter camera,
basically now attempts to do

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:15.610
the same thing the coded camera did,
except that this time around rather

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.389
than change the aperture, it wants to
change something about the shutter.

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:22.964
In coded aperture,
we added obstructions to the aperture.

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:27.526
In flutter shutter, let's control
when the shutter opens and closes.

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:32.125
So, you know, again have the whole thing
and just figure out how to open and

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.027
close it in a specific manner.

00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:36.709
Just to kind of look at this,
let's look at this series of examples.

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:39.833
A standard camera or traditional camera,
when it takes picture,

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:41.968
when the shutter is open,
you get one frame.

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:42.502
Right?

00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:46.330
And these are ideas come from this
Raskar et al 2006 paper that's

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.782
represented at the end and

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:51.151
also we'll provide you the links
where to look at in detail.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:54.019
I do encourage you to look at these
papers to kind of get a good sense of

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.364
the exact technical details.

00:00:55.364 --> 00:00:59.824
I'm just summarizing them and giving you
the big overview of these concepts here.

00:00:59.824 --> 00:01:01.901
So, of course,
when I open the shutter like this.

00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:06.016
And if the car is moving, what I would
basically get is the car is moved and

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:10.086
if I actually have the shutter,
you'd actually get some sort of blur.

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:12.245
A motion blur in this instance, right?

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:14.365
Let's look at it again.

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:18.431
When I open the shutter,
the car is moving.

00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:21.474
And of course,
depending how long the shutter is open,

00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:23.433
I will get a blurry image like this.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.269
Well, let's actually do
something interesting.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:29.002
Let's actually change how
the shutter opens and

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:31.467
also control it when it closes.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:34.398
So now basically what we'll do is
we'll open and close the shutter and

00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:35.948
this is basically showing you this.

00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:39.931
Now, if I know exactly how this opens
and closes, this is interesting.

00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:41.726
Now, I do get a motion blur image.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:46.638
But if you notice this one has
a very specific sharp lines.

00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:49.731
Let's look at them next to each other,
this was when the shutter was open

00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:52.469
the whole time and this was when
we kind of flutter shuttered it,

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.567
that is opened and
closed it at different rates.

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.053
Here everything is blurred.

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:59.014
In this one, you do see some blur.

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:01.590
But actually,there is a little
bit of a better signature.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.782
So you, for example, see these lines
at different you know, there's no,

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:07.768
of course, detail here whatsoever.

00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:11.875
But here, you actually see different
characteristic lines on this image.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:13.954
This actually is much
more useful than this.

00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:18.125
And if I actually know this code, then
I actually know a lot more about this

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:20.293
image too and that's the basic idea.

00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:23.216
If I know the code on how and
when I open this,

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:27.878
I should be able to kind of use this
information to model the output that

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:32.007
I'm getting after all of this
is accumulated or integrated.

00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:36.119
Here I know all of it, but since I have
no control over how the aspects of what

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.752
happened in the middle
everything is blurred.

00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:42.554
So Raskar et al actually designed
this camera by actually just taking

00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:46.552
an existing camera and putting some
sort of a additional controller that

00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:50.024
would basically change the control
of how the shutter opens and

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:52.081
closes with a digital process here.

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:55.601
So they actually, could actually
figure out the exact code on how the,

00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:56.840
the shutter would open.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.489
So they created this new
camera to do this and

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.148
they did a lot of other
experiments with it.

00:03:00.148 --> 00:03:03.050
Again, I recommend you to look
at the paper for more details.
