00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.340
The results of this research were staggering.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.430
Diagnostic accuracy increased from 39% to 91% for

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.930
the two dimensional model shown here.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.920
In terms of perception, this should make sense.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.440
The two dimensional model readily reveals all portions of the arteries,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.510
while the three dimensional model can hide links in the artery from view.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.930
Some might argue that the 3D model can be rotated, but it's important to

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.700
note that the 2D model can be viewed all at once within the span of the eye.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.340
This allows us to make comparisons more quickly and easily.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.953
I think one of the key takeaways from this research,

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:41.620
is that simple visualizations are generally better.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.890
You can read more about this visualization and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.910
all of Michelle's research in the instructor notes.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.840
For a Readers Digest version, I recommend looking at the slides she

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.820
put together for the 2011 InfoVis conference.
