00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.352
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's go back to the equation that we started this whole problem off with, 3

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:08.602
over x minus 1 over 5x equals 7. So we already solved the problem one way and

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.975
that was to combine our 2 fractions into 1 and then proceed. However there is

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:17.443
another method, and it's always good to explore a little bit more. The second

00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:21.835
thing that we could start off by doing, would be to Get rid of our fractions

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:25.912
right off the bat. And we know that the way we get rid of fractions is to

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:30.603
multiply fractions by numbers. So, let's think about what number we could use.

00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:35.019
Since x of the denominator of the first fraction on the left hand side, let's

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.451
start off trying with that. What equation do we have if we take the single step

00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:43.541
of multiplying both sides of this equation by x? Fill in the left side that

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:47.459
we'll be left with here, and the right side that we'll be left with here. You

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:51.551
can of course, combine like terms and simplify on either side of the equation if

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:55.570
you want to. I just don't want you to do anything else that modifies both sides

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.443
of the equation.
