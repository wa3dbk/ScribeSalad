00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.310
So, the next thing we need to understand about the problem is what are the

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.696
outputs? The statement of the question gives some idea of what the outputs

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:10.401
should be, and then, calculate your age in days part. But it doesn't specify

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:14.522
really explicitly what we want the output to be. So, let's make that a quiz. See

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:18.682
if there's enough information here for you to decide how we should specify the

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:22.022
output. The choices are, print a number, giving the number of days between the

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.270
first date and the second date. The second choice is return a number, giving the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.660
number of days between the first date and the second date. And the third choice

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.560
is output 3 values, giving the number of years, months and days between the two

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.903
input dates. Select the one you think is best.
