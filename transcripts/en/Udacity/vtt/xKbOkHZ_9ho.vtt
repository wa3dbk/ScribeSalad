00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.325
We just said that the degree of return in
a polynomial is the sum of all the

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:08.715
exponents of all the variables in that
term, so the degree is a number. Now

00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:13.480
knowing that, I would like you to write in
each of these boxes, what the degree of

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:16.482
the term next to them is. So just fill in
the proper number in each of these blanks.
