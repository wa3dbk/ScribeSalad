Bobby further developed his theory of attachment on two fundamental

00:00:03.014 --> 00:00:08.000
assumptions. First, a responsible and accessible caregiver, creates a secure

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.170
base for a child's development. Second, the primary bonding relationship

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.479
becomes a mental mold for all future friendships and love relationships. So,

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:21.924
here, humans are the most defenseless and vulnerable creatures on the planet

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:26.556
the first few months after they're born. We have virtually no ability to do

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:32.092
much of anything, except cry and nurse. Therefore, during the first few years

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:36.179
of life, having a stable, reliable and accessible caregiver is crucial for ones

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.615
physical growth, cognitive growth and social growth. It's just crucial for our

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:45.597
very survival. If the caregiver is neglectful or doesn't look after the baby's

00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:49.373
needs or even abuses them, then all aspects of the child's development can be

00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:55.130
stunted. And here, if a secure attachment forms between the caregiver and the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.730
cared for or the child, then the child grows up thinking that this is how a

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.532
relationship works. They're reliable and they're a source of security. And all

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:09.023
future friendships and love relationships start with this assumption. Likewise,

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:11.984
if a child is neglected and didn't form a secure attachment, then that's the

00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:16.370
assumption the person takes with them through all of their life relationships.
