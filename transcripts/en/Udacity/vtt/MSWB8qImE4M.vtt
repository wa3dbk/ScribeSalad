00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.450
We need to add the logic for

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.100
the rock paper scissors game,
the logic that defines who wins.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.130
For this, we'll need if statements.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.280
The general form for an if statement in
Objective-C looks something like this.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.660
It looks a lot like an if
statement in Swift,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.860
except you always have to have
parentheses around the condition.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.470
And of course, the statements
are followed by semi-colons.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.270
Let's add an if statement to the defeats
method you began defining earlier in

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.190
the RPSTurn class.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.530
We need to return true every time
the move associated with self,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.040
the object calling this method,
defeats the opponent's move.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.910
The opponent is being passed in here.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.080
So we need to return true for
three cases.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.250
If self.move is paper, and
opponent.move is rock, then return true.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.320
Self defeats opponent.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.920
Here's the second case.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.630
If self.move is scissors and
opponent.move is paper then return true.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.910
Self defeats opponent again.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.050
You can see that the logical operators,
the equals operator, the and and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.620
or operators,
are all the same as in Swift.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.085
And finally if self.move is rock and

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:08.640
opponent.move is scissors,
return true as well.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.080
For all other cases,
the opponent will defeat self so

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080
the method should return false.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.430
This method returns false if
the game is a tie, but that's okay.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.220
We're going to handle ties
in a different method.
