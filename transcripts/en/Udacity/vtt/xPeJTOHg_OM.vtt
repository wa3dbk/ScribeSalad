Here's an example from Sivic and
Zisserman in ICCV.

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:09.483
And the idea is that here we've carved
up feature space, sift or otherwise,

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:13.454
and the idea is that I've got in
this particular case three different

00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:14.720
code words.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.950
Here's a particular example.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.570
So they are brought in from real images.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.772
So you see one of the code words that
was found, I'm going to draw an example,

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:26.790
is basically a dark patch with a light
thing sticking out of the corner.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.900
And these are taken from
lots of different images.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.490
So that's like the eyeballs
that we saw before.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.880
And the idea is that all of the points
here are an example of that.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.500
So you could just say,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.800
how many of these code words
show up in a particular picture?
