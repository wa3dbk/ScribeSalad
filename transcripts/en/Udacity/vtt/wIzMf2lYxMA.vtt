Last time, we heard from Grant, a long, long time ago, he was on the plane going

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:08.588
from his hometown to Udacity where the glasses expo was. He made a map of his

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.018
flight path. We found its length, we found the midpoint between these 2 points,

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:17.486
so on and so forth. But now, we've been talking about slope, I would like you to

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:19.149
tell me the slope of this line.
