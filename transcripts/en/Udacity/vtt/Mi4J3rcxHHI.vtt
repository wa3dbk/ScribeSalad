00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The kind of method that we are using to solve the partial differential equation,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the heat equation that is, is professionally called the finite-difference scheme,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because we are forming differences of values that fit in finite distances not infinite decimal distances.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Diagrammatically, what we are doing looks like this.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
They are using the current value of our current position and the current value to its left

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the current value to its right to estimate the next value at our current position.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There are other ways for doing this. This is the most simple, but obviously, it leads to instability.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In the previous quiz, we saw that this scheme has a particular issue with this sort of function.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
A function that oscillates up and down with each step in space.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So let's compute what happens with this Berry function.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Assume that this is our initial distribution of temperature.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Temperature at times 0 depending on x.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Of course, physically speaking, negative temperatures won't make sense

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and particularly are not without the unit of measurement.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But now, we're doing a little mathematics.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, let's compute what's going to be the next temperature at x equals to 0.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The result of the first step of the temperature at time h, h is the step size, and position 0

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
will be its former value times 0 and position 0 plus step size times the rate of change,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and the rate of change is thermal diffusivity times the second derivative with respect to x,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which we estimate 1 over Δx².

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The old temperature to the left minus Δx plus the old temperature to the right

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
plus Δx minus 2 times the old temperature at 0.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So what's that going to be? The old temperature at position 0 equals 1. Same here.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The old temperature to the left equals -1 and that's to the right is -1 as well.

00:02:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is 1-1-1-2, which makes -4 step size times thermal diffusivity divided by Δx².
