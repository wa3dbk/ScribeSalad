00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.969
Let's talk about how to
handle text in a deep model.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.190
Imagine that you want
to classify a document.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.920
Is it talking about politics,
or business, or science maybe?

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.580
You're going to have to look
at the words in that document

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.240
to figure that out.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.100
Words are really difficult.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.550
There are lots of them and
most of them you never, ever see.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.610
In fact the ones that you rarely see,
tend to be the most important ones.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.430
If you know that your document contains
duh, you don't know much at all.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.960
But if you know that it
contains retinopathy,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.225
you know that it's probably
a medical document.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:45.121
Retinopathy appears with
a frequency of 0.0001% in English.

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:49.360
It's even possible that you've never
seen that word yourself before.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.290
For deep learning,
rare events like that are a problem.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.760
We like to have lots of training
examples to learn from.
