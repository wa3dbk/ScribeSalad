00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.987
Thinking about UV space,
if we have a particular gradient,

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:05.387
that gives us a line.

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:07.325
That's what this red one shows us.

00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:12.585
But suppose we have another gradient,
okay, but in the same little window.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:14.686
Well, that gradient would
give us a different line.

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:18.241
So here is our, this is gradient 1,
this is gradient 2,

00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.991
all within the same window.

00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:23.930
And then, here's gradient 3, and
it gives us a different line.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.570
Clearly, what's going on, is, if I have
a bunch of these different gradients,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.150
they're all going to intersect at,
at the point.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.360
That point is the correct UV.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.710
So, as long as we have different
gradients within the window,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.290
we can get a solution.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.150
We've seen this before, haven't we?

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.980
Here is the equation we just showed you,
A transpose A.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.840
And d equals negative A transpose b,
all right?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.130
When can that be solved?

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.250
To just solve this, we would want
A transpose A to be invertible, right?

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.910
because if it's invertible,
I just multiply both sides by that, and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.850
I come up with a solution for d.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.490
Okay?

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.340
Well when are matrices invertible?

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.370
Well they're, and from our linear
algebra we know that they need to be

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.120
what's called well-conditioned.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.110
If they're not well-conditioned
then the inverse is unstable, and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.130
basically you can look at
the eigenvalues, all right?

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.846
And the ratio of the largest
eigenvalue to the smog,

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:20.390
the smallest eigenvalue
shouldn't be too big.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.520
That's from your conditioning.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.240
In fact, if the second eigenvalue
were 0, l1 over l, or lambda 1 over

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.340
lambda 2 would be infinity, and
that'd be awful, all right?

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.260
So what we want are eigenvalues
that are, you know,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.890
approximately the same magnitude,
okay, so that will make it solvable.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.920
But wait, we also know when this
should be solvable from the geometric

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.160
demonstration we just did.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.510
This whole problem should be solvable,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.998
as long as there are different
gradients within the window.

00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:53.240
because if they're different
gradients within the window,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.140
then we get those inner sections
of those lines in uv space.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.740
So does this remind you of something,
gradients and eigenvalues?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.640
Of course it does, because you are like,
right on the ball, all right?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.010
You remember our Harris corner detector?

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.570
This matrix, A transpose A,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.890
that is the second moment
matrix of the Harris detector.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.830
And if you remember, we looked at
the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of that

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.010
matrix to know whether or
not something was a good corner.
