So it seems that Xcode has created a lot of boiler plate files for us.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.110
Now before we explore all of them, I have a challenge for you.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.460
I want you to imagine that you work for Apple as an engineer or

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.250
as a designer and that your boss has asked you to come up with the names for

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.920
these three different sections in Xcode.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.560
Section one, section two, and section three.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.900
So how would you go about naming these three different sections in Xcode?

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.470
Provide your answers in these boxes.
