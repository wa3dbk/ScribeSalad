00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, so let's think this through, what's going on here. So going back to the formula for a second.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Remember all the clauses end up being in these groups, so there's one clause for each node

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that says that that node has to have one of the k colors.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's going to total up to n clauses in the formula.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Then, for each pair of colors, we have to exclude that they are both true for every nodes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is for every node, for every pair of colors in the node, there's a clause.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
For every node, for every pair of colors, there's a clause. All right.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And that covers making sure that there's a color assignment that make sense.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then for each color, for each edge in a graph, we have a clause

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that excludes that that color is shared on both ends of that graph.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That's for each color, for each edge, we have a clause. So that ends up being the total.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There's no other clauses that we need to consider here that captures the notion of k color ability.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You can just plug these numbers in 8+(832/2) is 32, 3*20 is 60, 92 was what I get,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but the important thing that I wanted you to get at is this formula here,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which most importantly is polynomial in the size of the graph.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We have a graph of a given size that from that we generate a formula

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and the formula has given size and that size is polynomial.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's good because then when we run--imagine that we have some kind of satisfiability algorithm

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that runs in polynomial time--it's running on a polynomial size input, so it's not like we're running

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
a polynomial time algorithm on an exponential size input, which would take exponential time to run.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This way, it really does run in polynomial time.
