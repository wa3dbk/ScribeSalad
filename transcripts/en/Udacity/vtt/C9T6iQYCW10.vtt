00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.750
Now we're ready to describe
how to build this all powerful

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.870
universal Turing machine.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.230
As input to the universal machine,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.200
we give the description of
the machine we want to simulate, and

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.260
the input we want to simulate it on,
these two things separated by a #.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.060
The goal is to simulate m's
execution when given the input w.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.130
That means we loop, accept, or
reject, just as M would on w.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.610
And if M does halt,
we want the universal machine to output

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.020
the encoding of the tape
contents that M would have on w.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.130
We'll describe as three
tape Turing machine.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.300
That achieves this goal
of simulating M on W.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.590
The input comes in on the first tape.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.400
And here I've just written out
the mathematical description.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.000
And first, we'll copy this
description to the second tape.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.330
And we'll put the initial
state on the third tape.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.040
For example, the tape contents
might end up like this.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.280
Then we rewind the heads and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.980
begin the second phase of actually
simulating the execution.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.460
Here we searched for the appropriate
tupal in the description of the machine.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.260
The first element has to match
the current state stored on tape three.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.610
And the symbol part has to
match the encoding on tape one.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.870
If no match is found,
then we just halt the simulation, and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.610
put the universal machine in
an accepting or rejecting state,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.650
according to the current state of
the machine being interpreted.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.090
If there is a match, however, then we
apply the changes to the first tape.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.870
Moving ahead to the right position and
so forth, and then repeat this process.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.440
So, actually,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.290
interpreting a Turing machine
description is surprisingly easy.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.173
We've just seen how Turing machines
are indeed reprogrammable,

00:01:45.173 --> 00:01:47.460
just like real world computers.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.410
This lends further support to
the Church Turing Thesis, but

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.010
it also has a significance beyond that.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.910
Since the input to a Turing Machine can
be interpreted as a Turing Machine,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.120
this suggests that programs
are a type of data.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.400
But arbitrary data can also
be interpreted as a possibly

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.300
invalid Turing Machine.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.419
So is there any difference
between data and program?

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.020
I'll leave this for you to discuss
with your friends over lunch or

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.630
in the forums.
