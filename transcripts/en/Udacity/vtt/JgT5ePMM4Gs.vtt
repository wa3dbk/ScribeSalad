00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.375
And the answer is that these three, the ones that I've checked off, are parallel

00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:10.600
to y equals 4x minus 5. We can see this by doing a little bit of rearranging so

00:00:10.612 --> 00:00:15.525
we get each of these equations in the form y equals mx plus b. If we add y to

00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:20.985
both sides of this equation, we can rearrange this equation so that instead it

00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:25.895
reads y equals 4x. This one is already written in slope-intercept form, and we

00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:30.767
can see that it's slope is, in fact, 4. Just like that of our original line. If

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.357
we divide both sides of this equation by 2, we end up with y equals 4x minus

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:40.007
one-half. Here, m is the same as in this equation. For each of these lines,

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.716
however, which are not parallel to this equation, in order to get y by itself,

00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:49.493
we would have to divide both sides by 2. This would change the coefficient in

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:54.159
front of the x that it's no longer 4, which means that the slope of this line is

00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:58.477
actually 2. The same thing would happen for this equation. So, this is the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.582
perfect example of how sometimes, even if the coefficient in front of x, makes

00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:06.680
it look like a line could be parallel to another line. We have to make sure that

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:09.817
the equation is actually in slope intercept form before we can make assumptions

00:01:09.817 --> 00:01:10.817
about that.
