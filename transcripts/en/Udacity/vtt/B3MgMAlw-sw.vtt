Now that our app is showing real data, we should take

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.240
a screenshot of our app, so we can remember what it was

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.490
like when we made it this far. I personally like doing this

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.430
throughout the process of building an app, because then I can look

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.190
back, and see how it evolved. I'm going to show you one

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.170
way that you can take a screenshot of your device. Open up

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.080
Android Device Monitor and then click on the device here. Then, click

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.720
on this camera icon, to do a screen capture. When it pops

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.330
up, you can hit Save, and then you're done.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.140
On certain physical devices, there are actually hardware keys that

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.440
allow you to grab a screenshot. For example, on the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.910
Nexus 5, you can long press on the volume down

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.620
and the power key, at the same time. That takes

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.530
a screenshot. It gets saved to the Photos app and

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.940
then you can share it out to anyone you want.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.410
You can show them what an awesome app you're building.
