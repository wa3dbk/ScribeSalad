00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.590
All right, let's walk through this solution. So first

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.160
we're going to compute the denominator, so the data minus

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.000
the mean of the data squared, and then we'll take

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.100
the sum of that. Then we're going to compute the

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.990
numerator, which means that we'll compute the predictions minus the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.040
data squared, and sum that up. And then we'll compute

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.250
R squared. So we'll just subtract this fraction, this guy

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.070
over this guy, from one. Then we'll return R squared.
