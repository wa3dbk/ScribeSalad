00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:05.209
Well, we'd get 12r plus 3k for the numerator, and 12r minus 3k for the

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:10.020
denominator. Nice algebraic skills if you got these two correct. If this gave

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.044
you some trouble, that's totally okay. Let's see how we can distribute this kr

00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:18.665
to each of these terms. If we distribute kr to each of these terms, we can see

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:22.814
that we'll have this complex fraction. Now we need to simplify the

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:27.073
multiplication for each term. Some students are really great at doing it in

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:31.349
their head from this step. Though, sometimes I think it's better to show this,

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.003
so you can really see which factors are cancelling in a numerator and a

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:39.113
denominator. For example, we can see that k divided by k equals 1 here, r

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:43.996
divided by r equals 1 here, and we repeat that process in our denominator. So

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:51.818
we're left with 12 times r, or 12r, plus 3 times k, or 3k. For the denominator,

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:57.160
we're left with 12 times r minus 3 times k. Then, we should always ask ourselves

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.050
if we can simplify our answer. I've rewritten it here so we can see it better.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.122
We don't want to make the mistake that this fraction equals 1. We have addition

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:09.834
here, and subtraction here. Also, these are not opposite polynomials, so this

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:15.518
fraction doesn't reduce to negative 1. The coefficient of r is positive 12 here,

00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:20.531
and positive 12 here. But, we can see that this term and this term share a

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:25.456
common factor of 3. The same is true here. We factor a positive 3 from the

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:30.920
numerator and from the denominator. This leaves us with 4r plus k divided by the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.427
quantity 4r minus k, our final fraction. After multiplying by the LCD over the

00:01:36.427 --> 00:01:41.911
LCD, we really want to check if we can simplify. Sometimes this isn't always our

00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:43.003
final answer.
