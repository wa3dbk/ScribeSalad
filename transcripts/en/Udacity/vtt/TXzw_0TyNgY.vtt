00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.580
Alright, here's the quiz. So just to practice this

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.510
concept of what a version space is let's go

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.010
through an example. So here we go. Here's the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.410
actual target concept C and, for all possible, it's, mapping

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.580
from two input bits to an output bit. And

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.770
the two inputs, X1 and X2 can take on all

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.010
four possible different values and the outputs are zero

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.710
One, one, zero, which is to say the XOR function,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.870
okay so that's what we're trying to learn.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.830
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.100
&gt;&gt; But the training data that we have only has

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.020
a couple examples in it. It says well, one training example

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.960
says if the inputs are zero and zero. The output is

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.680
zero. And if the inputs are one and zero, the output

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.120
is one. And, ultimately, we're going to ask questions like,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.650
well, what happens if the input is one and one? What's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.080
the output? Now, since we know that it's XOR, we know

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.260
that the answer is zero but that's kind of using information unfairly.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.900
So here's what we're going to do. Here's a set of, a hypothesis set. These are

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.734
set of functions. That says, well the output could be just copy X1, negate

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:06.700
X1, copy X2, negate X2, ignore the inputs in return true, ignore the

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.650
inputs in return false, take the OR of the inputs,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.640
take the AND of the inputs, take the XOR of the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.980
inputs and then return whether or not the inputs are

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.410
equal to each other. And, what I'd like you to do

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.710
is, some of these are in the version space and some of them are not for this

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.430
training set that I marked here. So, can you

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.080
check off which ones are in the version space?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.320
&gt;&gt; I think I can.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.590
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Let's do it.
