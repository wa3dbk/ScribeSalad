00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.260
The second one might have been tricky but they both equal negative 1. We want to

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.220
remember that the negative sign is really a negative 1 being multiplied by this

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.180
expression. We know x plus 3 divided by x plus 3 equals 1. So now we can

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.720
simplify our fraction. This just leaves us with negative 1. For our second

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.595
rational expression, we can think of a 1 being outside of the expression a plus

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:27.174
4. For the denominator, we're going to factor out a negative 1. Leaving us with

00:00:27.174 --> 00:00:31.714
negative 1 a plus 4. If we were to distribute this negative 1 back inside the

00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:36.530
parenthesis we'd get our original denominator. We know this step is correct. We

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.105
can simplify the a plus 4s since they equal 1leaving us with 1 times 1 in the

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:45.785
numerator and negative 1 times 1 in the denominator. This just simplifies to

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:50.268
negative 1. You might have spotted this first one easily. Great work if you. If

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:53.293
you did. It's okay if this one gave you trouble.
