00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.253
Soon, very soon you're going to have
a similar story that you can share with

00:00:04.253 --> 00:00:06.610
your friends and family.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.890
Hi, I'm Jessica Allman, and I'm going to
be here to help you walk through

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.680
the process of building
an app from scratch.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.470
Now, this course is going to be
a little bit different than what

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.740
you've previously experienced
in Udacity courses.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.300
For one, you've already got the
technical traps to build this app, but

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.260
you might need a little bit more
help with maybe a processor or

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.720
method for doing so.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.240
And, that's what I'm here for.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.210
So, to do so, we're going to be
asking you a series of questions,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.360
to help you start kind of
thinking like a developer and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.790
asking questions that
they would be asking.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.180
And we hope that you really do think
about and answer these questions,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.400
recording your answers either
in a blog or on the forums.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.160
Or if you're a little shy and
don't want to post it publicly,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.610
maybe in a handy notebook or
on your own computer.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.360
Let's take a look at how
we're going to build an app.
