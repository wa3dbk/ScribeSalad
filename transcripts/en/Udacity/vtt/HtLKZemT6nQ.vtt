00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
Now I will give you another type of problem and this time you can prove that this problem is

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.800
undecidable, and the problem is as follows and that problem is also one that sounds very simple.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.840
It's the equivalence problem.  So this time, we're given two programs, P and P prime,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.540
and the question that we want to answer is do this two programs do exactly the same thing?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.790
For example, do they implement exactly the same algorithm only using a different type of

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.850
implementation, and now, what I would like you to do is prove that equivalence is undecidable

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.630
by showing that if you have an algorithm that would solve equivalence then you could also solve

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.130
the halting problem.  Now, the way we're going to do this quiz is as follows:

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.390
I have here six building blocks or potential building blocks of this group, and I would like you to do

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.690
the following:  There are four building blocks that you actually need for the proof and there are two

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.090
building blocks, which are not necessary for the proof.  And what I want you to do is to find out

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.980
which building blocks you need and which you don't need, and for the building blocks that you

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.820
need bring them in the right order.  So, right one next to the building blocks that would come first

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.960
in a proof of undecidability of equivalence then you write a 2 next to the next building block and so on.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.650
It might be easier to first think of how you would prove this and then fill out the boxes

00:01:16.650 --> 99:59:59.000
rather than playing around with them.  How you prove that equivalence is undecidable?
