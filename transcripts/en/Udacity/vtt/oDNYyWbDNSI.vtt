In addition to motivation for belonging, we also see as humans we have a

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.652
motivation to excel, which is incredibly beneficial to the workplace. This is

00:00:10.652 --> 00:00:14.901
achievement motivation. Achievement motivation is a desire to do things well

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:19.608
and to overcome obstacles. In general, when we succeed at something that's very

00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:23.994
difficult, we find it more meaningful. Then if we were to succeed at something

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:26.724
that was easy, because if we succeed at something that's easy, then it doesn't

00:00:26.724 --> 00:00:31.654
really tell us much about our abilities. For example, you're most likely to

00:00:31.654 --> 00:00:34.782
derive more meaning from successfully finishing a half-marathon than you would

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:38.895
feel for just walking a mile. Let's move on to talk about achievement in

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:44.080
regards to motivation in the workplace. If you recall from lesson one when we

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.472
discussed a different sub field of psychology, this is where the sub field of

00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:52.576
Industrial and Organizational psychology comes into play. I/o psychology

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:56.528
studies motivation and behavior in the workplace. And yes as you can imagine

00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.480
employers want to know what motivates their employees.
