00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now I want you to implement a measurement model,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
using the function sense, that is more characteristic

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of what's often in the literature on robotics.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Say we have a robot

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we have a landmark, then the robot can measure their bearing or angle

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to this landmark relative to its own local coordinate system.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Whereas before we measured ranges or distances,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
now we measure bearings or angles.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We assume in the world there are 4 landmarks--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
L1, L2, L3, and L4. All of those are distinguishable.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The measurement vector is a set of 4 bearings

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that correspond to those four different landmarks.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
When you implement this, I recommend you use the function

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
arctan2, which is the generalization of arctangent

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that takes as input delta y and then delta x.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Arctan 2 would give you the orientation of a vector in global coordinates.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We then have to adjust for the fact that it's relative to the robot's local coordinates,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which is done by subtracting the orientation of the robot.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This should give you the implementation of a bearing to a landmark.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
With this implementation I add a variable called "bearing_noise,"

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which you probably already used because it was already referenced before.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I set it to 0 just so that we have no noise, and you can just your code.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We initialize the robot coordinates as 30 and 20.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Motions are now irrelevant.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But as I go down, I now give the following two lines of code.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I print the coordinates as before, and I print the measurements.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The robot is at 30/20, and the bearings for these landmarks will be

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
6.00, 3.72, 1.92, and 0.85.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
My question for you is can you implement the software the measures those bearings.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If I changed the initial orientation of the robot to be pi over 5,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I now get my new robot coordinates over here,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and my measurement vector outputs me very different values.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That's because this robot is now rotated

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and therefore all the bearings to the landmarks do change.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's 5.3, 3.1, 1.3, and 0.22.

00:02:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Implement a measurement function that gives me exactly those values.
