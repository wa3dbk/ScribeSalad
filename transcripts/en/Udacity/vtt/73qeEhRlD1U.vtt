The great thing about modules is, not only do they allow us to organize our own

00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:07.104
code better, then allows us to share code with other people. And sharing is a

00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:10.496
great thing, it allows us to write much more interesting programs, much more

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:14.176
quickly than if we had to write everything ourselves. One very useful module

00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:18.336
that we could have used for the search engine, if we were using modules instead

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:22.560
of learning by writing all the code ourselves, is this great Python library for

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.014
processing web pages, known as Beautiful Soup. And you can see the Beautiful

00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:30.525
Soup page here. There's a link to it in the instructor comments as well. And to

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:34.852
use it, first you need to download it. As long as you've got that Python Package

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:38.297
Manager already set up, which most of you probably do, if you've installed the

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:42.984
standard version of Python. You can do it just using this command. Unlike other

00:00:42.984 --> 00:00:45.844
modules that we've imported so far, Beautiful Soup is not part of the standard

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:49.596
Python library. So to use it, you have to install it first. If you have pip

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:54.250
installed this is really easy. Pip is a Python Package installer. All we would

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.536
need to do is this, it would know how to download it and install it, and set it

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:01.492
up to work on your machine. If you don't have pip installed already, there are

00:01:01.492 --> 00:01:05.676
directions for how to set up pip, in the instructor comments. It's very useful

00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:09.126
to set this up, makes it much easier to install packages after that. Now that

00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:12.943
we've installed Beautiful Soup, we can import it into our search engine code.

00:01:12.943 --> 00:01:16.719
And instead of all the code that we wrote for extracting links, we can use what

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.443
Beautiful Soup already provides.
