00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.418
Now that we found the balance after the first 2 years, it would be great if we

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:10.072
could find it even further along in time. Let's work right now to find the

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:14.434
balance after 3 years. Actually, you already did this earlier, but I'd like us

00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:19.058
to write it in this kind of notation. We start with this amount, since that's

00:00:19.058 --> 00:00:25.352
how much money there is at the start of your three. And then, the amount that

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:32.555
we need to add to this in interest, is just this quantity times 0.03. If we

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:37.454
factor out this quantity from both terms, then we end up, once again, with 1

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:44.430
plus 0.03, inside this second set of parentheses. However, since we have 1 plus

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.821
0.03 squared here, times that quantity again, 1 plus point 0 3. We can make

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:54.941
this look more compact, by changing our exponent up here. Instead of squared,

00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:59.619
this is cubed this time. Now that we have another quantity continuing our

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:05.150
pattern here, what do you think about the guess that you made just before this?

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.866
Do you want to keep it as is, or do you want to change it? Think about what

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:13.136
pattern you see. Think about what you think the exponent in each of these

00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:17.426
expressions means, and then use that information, that pattern to write down

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:24.105
the balance in this form after 4 years, after 10 years, and after 100 years.

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:28.404
I'll also give you another chance to write down your hypothesis. You can write

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:31.752
in exactly what you wrote before or you can change it this time, taking into

00:01:31.752 --> 00:01:37.580
account the new information we have now. Once again, this part won't be graded.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.170
We are, however, going to see how your numbers look.
