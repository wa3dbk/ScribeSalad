00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.490
Before going any further, let's put some
module level variables into our code.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.200
We can see these are pretty
straight forward.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.150
The first one is just the tag
that we're going to be using, and

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.296
the tag is just the string with the
details of the application that you're

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:14.938
going to use for logging.

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:19.260
Then we're going to create a Google API
client, called mGoogleApiClient,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.720
a location object that we call
mLastLocation, a text view object,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.900
that we call mLatitudeText, and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.770
another text view object,
that we call mLongitudeText.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.720
So next up, what we need to do
is update the onCreate function.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.960
We're going to create it to set the
content view, get a reference to each of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.460
our views, and then finally
build the Google API client.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.989
Let's see what that looks like.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.620
So here's the code.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.370
I'm just again, creating a text view
by finding the latitude text and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.392
setting that to my latitude text,
text view.

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:53.142
And then ditto with the longitude text,
finding the item,

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:55.789
cast it to a text view and
assigning it to longitude text.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.283
And then I've written a helper
function called buildGoogleApiClient.

00:00:59.283 --> 00:01:00.805
As you can see, it's red right now.

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:03.752
That's okay, it's just because I
haven't actually implemented this yet.

00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:05.420
We'll do that in the next step.
