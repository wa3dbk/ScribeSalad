00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'll now ask you to make your own scatter plot.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Please graph this new data and tell me based on the graph--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
please really draw it on a piece of paper--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
whether the function between price and size is linear--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that is, can you draw a line through all the scatter plot data on your diagram?

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is this linear? Yes or no?
