00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's a sketch of the algorithm as we were just running it by hand.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Largely, we're trying to find shortest distances from D to the other nodes in the graph.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we initialize D's distance to V as 0, then we imagine that all the other distances

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to all the other nodes in the graph were as yet unknown, and each time we go through the loop,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that there's still nodes left that haven't been completed yet.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We find the node with the shortest known distance and then we locked it down.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
By marking it as known and then going through the list of its edges--all that edges out of W--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for example, just some other node and we check if the new distance, the distance to W

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that we just locked down plus the weight of the edge from W to X.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If that improves on the best known distance to X, then we update X's distance to be this new value.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And once we've done that for all the neighbors of W, then we could finished W

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and we go back up to this loop and say not all nodes are complete.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You get a new W, a new shortest distance to lock down. So that's the basic structure.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Let's actually look at that in--I'm going to say Python.
