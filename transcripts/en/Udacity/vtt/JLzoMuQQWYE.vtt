00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We will now give a slightly more complicated problem of the form we're going to be using

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we're going to be using and I hope you won't be too confused.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, this is it. There's two parts to it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There's the print command as before but rather than printing 0.3 directly,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we're going to print the function that computes something from 0.3.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Right now it's identity is going to print out exactly the same value

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but we're doing this is to set ourselves up to print something else.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.680
And here is how f is defined.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.000
We define f with the argument p that will be set to 0.3,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to be just a function that returns exactly the same value.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.730
Why do we do this? Well, to practice programming.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.557
So, hit the run button and see what happens.
