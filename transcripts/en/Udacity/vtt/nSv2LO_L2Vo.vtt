00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.981
In general, the elimination method is useful when one variable has the same

00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:08.026
number or the same coefficient in front of it as the other. But they need to be

00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:12.116
opposite in sign, just like these y's. We can eliminate the y variables in the

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:16.084
last problem, because the y here had a positive 1 as a coefficient and this y

00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:19.899
had a negative 1 as its coefficient. We know, if we added these two terms

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:24.218
together, we would get 0. So this is what we want to strive for. We want

00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:27.999
variables with the same coefficient, but with opposite sides.
