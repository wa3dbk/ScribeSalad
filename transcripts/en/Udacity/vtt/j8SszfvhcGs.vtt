00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.920
There are a few solutions,
I happened to choose this one here.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.960
Note that although the minimum
vertex cover is three,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.420
the maximum matching is only two for
this graph.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.350
The size of the vertex cover serves as
an upper bound, but it is not tight for

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.970
general graphs.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.560
As we'll see next, however,
it is tight for bipartite graphs.
