00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For this first problem, we're going to be writing a program that checks Sudoku grids   

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to make sure that they are valid sub-grids, and if you haven't played Sudoku before we'll go over    

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
briefly or you can go check the Wikipedia page,  

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which probably has a far more in-depth explanation than we could ever give here. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Sudoku is a game played by on a 9x9 grid, which will be representing as a list of lists    

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that contains 81 elements and each one of this 81 elements has to be a number between 0 and 9  

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
including 0 and 9 and if either of this doesn't hold,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
then we'll be returning none right away before we do anything else. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If we do pass those any checks, then we're going to return true if all of these hold,   

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which are the basic checks that go on in a Sudoku game.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Each number 1 through 9 occurs only once in each row.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It also occurs only once in each column and in each 3x3 sub-grid on the box on the board,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and it also occurs only once in each 3x3 sub-grid in the over all grid 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and it might be clear with a bit of a picture.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Here you can see all nine 3x3 sub-grids.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Each of this should only have the number 1 through 9 once for each sub-grid.  

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now, you can have zero in a valid sub-grid, it means it hasn't been encoded yet.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We don't have any solution, for instance, that has those numbers in it. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Your program would have to account for that, and I will give you a few examples before we expect.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
First, we get an L form board where, see that this row doesn't have mine elements. It only has eight.     

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We should return none immediately.  

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This is a valid board with no zeros and it shouldt return true. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
This is an invalid board that should return false, because it has the elements 1 through 9 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
either in more than once in a row or a column or a 3x3 sub-grid.  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We need to check that is indeed the case for this one,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and then we have two that aren't finish.   

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
One that's a fairly easy Sudoku puzzle appeared going solid by hand    

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and one that is actually quite difficult

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 to solve by hand at least for me and both of these should return true. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You can solve those piece with a valid different answers.    

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You're going to write this in the check_Sudoku function,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and give you these different statements to check them.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now these are the only test cases we're going to be testing against for this problem set.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
That's not really the point of this assignment though.  

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What I'd like you to do is go to the forums and post the code that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
you used to solve this in the forums and we'll have a link to a specific forum post   

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
in the instructor comments down below the video, so please check that.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'd also like you to look at other people's code  

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and see if you can think of some fuzzers that would break these people's code.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Either a specific instances in those code or if you have a general purpose fuzzer      

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that would run well against general Sudoku checkers then go ahead and post that in the forums.  

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I'd really like you to think about what kind of inputs   

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and what kind of testing you would have to do in order to do this well.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I hope you had fun with this.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I hope there's a lot of great discussion on the forum about it,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and I look forward to seeing all of your solutions.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Okay, great. Have fun.
