00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So far all of the procedures you've written have been quite simple,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
only needed a line or maybe two of code to finish them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.400
Now we're going to try a quiz which is going to be much more challenging,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.000
and I'm going to give it a gold star to show that this is an especially challenging quiz.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.769
If you can get this one on your own, you're really understanding things very well.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.123
If you get stuck on this one, that's okay.

00:00:21.123 --> 00:00:25.000
They'll be some hints to make it a little easier, and then hopefully you'll understand

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the answer after you see it, and you'll have a lot more chances especially on the homework

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to try some harder questions on your own.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So here's the question.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Your goal is to define a procedure, and we'll call this one find_second.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.892
It takes 2 strings as its inputs, so the first input is the search string.

00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:46.708
The second input is the target string.

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:51.000
And your goal is to print out the position of the second occurrence of the target string

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
in the search string.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.538
It should output a number that is the position of the second occurrence of the target string

00:00:57.538 --> 00:00:59.000
in the search string.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.815
I'll show you an example in the Python interpreter of what find_second should do,

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.000
then you should try and solve this on your own.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
For an example, here's the quote we had in unit 1 from George Danton,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and if we evaluate find_second, passing in danton as the first input

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and 'audace' as the second,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
what we should get is the position of the second occurrence of 'audace'

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in the input string danton.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
When we run this, we see that we get 25, which is that position.
