00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.690
Next up, we've got dot notation for

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.550
objects, which we just used to access bio.name.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.680
Dot notation allows us to declare an object, and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.210
then define its properties outside the curly braces.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.090
&gt;&gt; The syntax looks like so, we'll have object.someproperty=somevalue.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.210
&gt;&gt; For instance, bio.email equals my email address.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.440
&gt;&gt; Hey, I see we didn't use var.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.020
&gt;&gt; Nope, with dot notation, there's no need to use var.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.030
We're adding properties to an object, not creating new variables.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.130
&gt;&gt; Right, and then we'll access them the same way we did before.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.280
&gt;&gt; Yep, we can use dot notation to access properties and

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.850
append them to the page.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.870
&gt;&gt; There's at least one more syntax pattern to define the properties of

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.100
an object right?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, bracket notation.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.090
There's actually one more, but to learn more about that one,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.240
you can check out the instructor's notes.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.270
Bracket notation is similar to dot notation in that we can

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.740
declare an object ,and then later in the code define its properties.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.678
This time, rather than dots, we'll use brackets.

00:01:02.678 --> 00:01:07.780
So, we have bio with the string, city, in brackets equals Mountain View, and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.490
bio, with the string email in brackets equals my email address.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.540
&gt;&gt; Right, so the syntax looks like object, then a string of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.160
the property name inside these square brackets equals some value.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.050
So, if we wanted to append our city to the page,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.120
we just write this code right here.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.590
And when we refresh our page, we see that it still says mountain view
