00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, so now that we know that while sometimes we can be clever

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a lot of the time we just can't test everything we would like.   

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
How useful is any individual test case? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Is there any way to make a test case that is a little bit more useful in practice?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's look at this real quick--we just enqueued 7 into our

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
fixed-size queue and then immediately dequeue it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So we should get 7 back out and if that's the case then we print success 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and otherwise we have an error.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
How useful is this? Let's go ahead and turn this into a quiz. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The question is if we passed this test case, what else have we learned

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
about our code or have we learned anything?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And your options are our code passes this one test case,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
our code passes any test case where we replaced 7 with a different integer,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
or our code passes many test cases where we replaced 7 with a different integer.  

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Check all that apply.
