00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.410
Now I'll move forward with
the JSON example, and

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.200
I think you're really
going to like this.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.350
Now the code is almost identical, but

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.202
what happened to all of our functions
that help us visualize the maze?

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:16.670
I'm going to show you something
that's pretty cool with playgrounds.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.296
So we're looking at
the maze JSON example.

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:24.049
If we drop this down,
let's look in this Sources.swift file.

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:25.800
Now here it is.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.710
In this file, we have all
the functions that we defined earlier

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.530
that help us visualize the maze.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.030
So everything defined in the Sources
folder, so this Sources.swift file, and

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.870
any additional files we may have,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.520
they can be accessed by
our Maze JSON Example.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.070
So let's go back to that file here.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.490
And you'll notice just some small
differences between this example with

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.240
JSON and
the PList examples that we've seen.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.080
But the difference is small.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.686
First, we need to create a URL that
points to the JSON file instead of

00:00:57.686 --> 00:00:58.587
the PList file.

00:00:58.587 --> 00:01:02.526
Then we load the JSON data
into an NSData object.

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:05.110
Now this is a little bit
different than we saw earlier.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.970
At this point our data is raw,
it's not organized into an array, or

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.700
a dictionary, we're going to
have to do that ourselves.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.260
These next few lines of
code use the do keyword,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.030
which we'll discuss later
when we get to errors.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.580
Do will allow us to run some code that
could potentially cause an error, but

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.860
in our case, it'll work,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.640
as long as we specify the file name
here and the extension correctly.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.740
Inside the do block,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.970
we run some code that'll convert the raw
JSON data into a usable dictionary.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.370
Then from there, we call our
visualizeMaze function again and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.240
it visualizes the maze as this string.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.250
So now we've created the same maze
from two different data formats,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120
with a Plist and with JSON.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.390
That's awesome, and for
a little fun I encourage you to try

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.260
messing with the truth values
in either of the files, and

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.020
see how it affects this maze
that's ultimately generated.
