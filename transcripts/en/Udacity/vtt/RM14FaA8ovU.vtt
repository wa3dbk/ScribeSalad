00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.280
A class works great when you want to produce a fleet of similar objects as

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.939
with the target code in this run.js example.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.880
But what if you wanted a second category of objects that was

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.280
vaguely similar to this Car category?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.280
Maybe you decide that in addition to enemy vans,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.018
your game also needs cop cars that can be called to the player's aid.

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.900
So you decide that cops would behave pretty similarly to vans, but

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140
they'd have a few important differences.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.320
You'd probably need to refactor this code so

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.680
that the cops can behave a little bit differently.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.509
So imagine cal is going to be one of these cops.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.960
The cal object ought to have all the same vehicular powers as the other two

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.970
cars did.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.050
What function could you use to build this object?
