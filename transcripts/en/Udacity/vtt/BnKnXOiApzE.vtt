00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.360
So at this point, once the kernel has

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.570
doctored this client thread to start executing the

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.950
server procedure, it can transfer control to the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.960
server. So it transfers the control to the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.490
server, and so now, now we're starting to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.930
execute the server procedure in the server's address

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.615
space. And in the server's address space because

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:25.230
A-stack has been mapped in, this is also available

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.680
to the server domain. And the first thing

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.650
that's going to happen in the server domain is

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.440
our server stub is going to get into action

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.160
and take the arguments that are sitting in

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.230
the A-stack, and copy them into the stack

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.750
that the server procedure's going to use. Remember I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.410
told you the kernel provides a special stack

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.680
for the purpose an E- stack, execution stack and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.666
that is a stack into which the client,

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.500
the server stub is going to copy the A-stack

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.800
argument into that E-stack and then at that

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.440
point the procedure foo is ready start executing.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.420
So at this point, procedure foo is like

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.090
any normal procedure, it finds the information it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.060
wants on the stack, it does its job.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.170
Once it is done with executing this procedure,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.280
it has to pass back the results to the client and what is going to happen is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.700
that the server stub is going to take the results

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.225
of this procedure execution and copy them into the

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:30.130
A-stack. And of course, all of this action is

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.830
happening in the server domain without any mediation by

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.150
the kernel. So once the server stub has copied

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.410
the results into the A-stack, at that point it

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.270
can trap into the kernel, and this is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.740
the vehicle by which the kernel can transfer control

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.090
back to the client so it, it does a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.850
return trap. Now, when this return trap happens, there

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.980
is no need for the kernel to validate this

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.930
trap as opposed to the call trap, because the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.040
up call was made by the kernel in the

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.350
very first place, and therefore it is expecting this

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.870
return trap to happen, and so the kernel doesn't have

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.230
to do any special validation for this. And at this point,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.630
what the kernel is going to do, is it is basically

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.600
going to re-doctor the thread to start executing the client address

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.310
space. So basically it knows the return address where it has

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.660
to go back in order to start executing the client code,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.170
and it knows the client's address space so it's going to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.760
redoctor the thread to start executing in the client address space.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.440
So when the client thread is rescheduled to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.630
execute, at that point, the client stub gets

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.650
back into action, copies the results that are

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.310
sitting in the A-stack into the stack of the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.130
client, and once it has done that, the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.110
client thread can continue on with its normal execution.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.930
So that's what is going on. And the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.040
important point that you notice is that the copying

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.000
through the kernel that used to happen

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.300
is now completely eliminated, because your arguments are

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.770
passed through the A-stack into the server. And

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.840
similarly the result is passed through the A-stack

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.940
into the client. So let's analyze what we've

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.110
accomplished in terms of reducing the cost of

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.820
the RPC in the actual calls that are

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.570
being made between the client and the server.
