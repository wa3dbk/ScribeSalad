00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.370
We want the user to be able to
toggle between viewing set memes

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.280
as a collection and
viewing them as a table.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.848
We'll do this using
a tab bar controller.

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:11.170
Tab bar controllers
are fairly straight forward,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.980
let's practice by setting up
the Bond Villian's app using tabs.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.500
Here I've got the Bond Villian's app
with the master detail structure and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.479
I'm going to drag in
a tab bar controller.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.180
The tab bar controller comes
automatically connected to two items.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.780
I don't need those though, so
I'm going to go ahead and delete them.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.710
I'll connect the tab bar
controllers first tab by dragging

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.630
from the connections menu.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.570
Here under triggered segues to the
navigation controller for my table view.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.150
Next up, we'll connect
the collection view controller.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.050
Here you can see I've added the
Villain Collection View Controller for

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.880
showing bond villains in a grid.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.280
And I've assigned it as the root
ViewController to this second navigation

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.520
controller.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.110
I'll connect the second tab to
the navigation controller for

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.730
the collection view, again, by dragging
from the ViewController segues

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.800
in the tab bar controllers
connections menu.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.480
And then once I've got the tab
bar controller all connected up,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.150
I want to make sure that it's set
up as the initial ViewController.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.830
Which I can do here in
the attributes inspector.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.660
And then we'll run it.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.740
Okay, there's our table, and
we can toggle to a collection and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.560
back to a table.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.990
Alright.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.870
And if you want to change the appearance
of the bar items, you just go back into

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.610
Storyboard, click on the bar item in its
respective navigation controller, and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.650
then in the attributes inspector,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.170
you can change the title [SOUND]
or you can add an image.
