00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.680
Congratulations, you've finished the first lesson of the course.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.630
In this lesson, you learned why saving old versions of your files might

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.360
be useful, and you learned some systems that can help you do this

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.640
called version control systems.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.000
You also learned a particular system called Git, and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.620
got practice using it to review the history of existing projects.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.500
In the next lesson, you'll create your first Git repository and

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.180
create that history.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.500
See you then.
