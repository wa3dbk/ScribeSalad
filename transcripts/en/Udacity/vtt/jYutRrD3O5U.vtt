00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is a straight line, and the reason is really subtle.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's because we're not modifying the first and last point.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Otherwise, it would be a single point.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I just hit the run button, and if you look at these coordinates, they go in 0.5 increments

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the same is true with this coordinate over here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is obviously the coordinates of a straight line

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
as a result of our smoother applied with a smoothing weight of 0.1 and no data weight.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If we change this to no smoothing weight, we obviously get the original path.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If we look at the right side as well as the left side, it's not identical.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
When you implement your algorithm, please test this on those settings,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we will give you a different path in our testing to see if your algorithm is implemented correctly.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Congratulations!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You just learned how to produce a smooth path. There are a few caveats.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If you apply this algorithm in a robot world like this where an A-star planner might give you something like this,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the smooth path might then lead straight through the obstacle, which you don't want.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There are ways to accommodate this, which I'll just hint at.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
One is to use dynamic programming with a stochastic action function.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You've learned this in the previous homework assignment.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That way we stay away from the obstacle.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The second one is to introduce a term that propels you away from obstacles.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I won't go into any depth here, but in your optimization you could have a term

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that pushes you away from obstacles

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
by maximizing the distance between the nearest obstacle and data point.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
When you toss that in, you get a path that might look more like this

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that is still smooth but maximizes your clearance from obstacles.

00:01:35.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We will revisit this in the homework assignment.
