Okay, so a quick quiz. What does a database refer to?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Is it a program that stores and retrieves data?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Is it the machine running that program?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Or is it a group of machines working together to store and retrieve data?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Check all that apply.
