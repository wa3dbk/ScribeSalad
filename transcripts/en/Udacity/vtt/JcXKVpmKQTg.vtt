00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.270
Hi. Welcome to the coding portion of lesson 4.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.380
Now we're going to create some conferences. A conference management

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.940
application really needs to be able to create and

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.970
save conferences. After we've created some conferences, we're going to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.500
learn how to run queries and use filters to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.330
query those conferences. For example, suppose you've got a trip

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.790
planned to San Francisco in June and you want

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.950
to find out if there's any conferences going on then.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.440
I'll show you how to write the code to

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.370
find out. Then we're going to delve deeper into indexes.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.610
We're going to look at the index configuration file and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.960
then we're going to use the index viewer in the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.160
admin console to explore our indexes, to make sure

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.040
that they're serving so that our users don't get index

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.750
non existent errors. Another thing our application really needs to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.260
be able to do is to allow users to register

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.120
for conference, and the registration process

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.010
needs to take place inside a transaction.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.300
Suppose you give us your credit card number, you want to make sure you've

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.040
really got a seat before the payment goes through. So, we're going to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.440
use the registration process to practice

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.120
writing transactions. Let's go create some conferences.
