00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.460
Now that you know a little more
about enumerations, structs, and

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.590
classes in Swift, I want to play a game
I'm calling enum, class, or struct?

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.610
Choose the right type for the job.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.210
So for each type I describe,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.350
we're going to choose whether we should
use an enum, a class, or a struct.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.830
The first one is a triangle.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.970
It has two properties, an array
of angles and an array of sides.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.830
And I think we should choose, struct.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.780
This is a simple type, just a couple
collections with few values each.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.200
And one might imagine that each time
we make a triangle we want a distinct

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.570
copy to be made.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.850
Also, there's no need for inheritance.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.040
If we did want inheritance, for
example for an isosceles triangle and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.690
a right triangle
the subclass from triangle.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.448
In that case we'd choose class.

00:00:45.448 --> 00:00:49.810
Number two,
UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.240
This is the type that indicates
where images should be chosen from,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.400
when they're being attached to
a text message, for example.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.680
Our biggest clue here is that the source
type has three distinct values,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.489
photo library, camera and
saved photos album.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.630
So we should choose, enum.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.570
The UIImagePickerControllerSourceType
is indeed an enumeration.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.640
Enums are convenient for

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.740
types that can be described as one
property with a finite number of values.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.010
Here's another one.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.080
We need a type for a name object which
holds two strings, a first name and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.690
a last name.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.800
Again, I would choose struct
because we're dealing with few

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.610
relatively simple values.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.420
And we're probably going to want every
instance of a name to have its own copy.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.230
Let's go through just a couple more.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.030
let's say we need a type to represent
a subject in secondary school.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.550
This is a very traditional school at
which there are only four subjects.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.240
Math, English, Spanish and Science.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.650
What would you choose?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.090
For this one again with a finite
number of values an enumeration

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.280
would work well.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.960
This last one is a little more complex.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.700
Here we need a type to
represent a student.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.430
It will have a grades property to hold
an array of grades, a name property to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.180
hold a name, a favorite subject
property which holds a subject, and

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.960
a computed property to hold
the grade point average.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.090
Additionally there are a few
different types of students.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.670
High school, elementary school,
and middle school.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.800
So we want those subtypes to be able to
inherit from the more generally defined

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.200
student type.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.260
So what kind of type should we choose?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.080
For this one, we'll want a class.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.140
Between classes, enums, and structs,
only classes have inheritance.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.090
On top of that, the structure of this
type is a little more complex than

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.620
you see in most structs.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.720
A struct could hold the data,
but it would be unusual.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.860
That ought to give you a good
start on structs and enumerations.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.410

deepen your understanding of value types

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.500
and reference types, and for more
practice choosing the right type for

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.670
your needs.

and customize the functionality of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.147
all of these type's with protocols and
extensions.
