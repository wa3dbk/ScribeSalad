00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.210
It turns out that content distribution networks and ISPs have a fairly symbiotic

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.950
relationship when it comes to peering relationships. CDNs like to peer with ISPs

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.680
because peering directly with ISPs, where

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.650
a customer's located, provides better throughput. Since

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.180
there are no intermediate AS hops. And network latency is lower. Having more

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.830
vectors to deliver a content increases reliability.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.310
And during large request events, having direct

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.620
connectivity to multiple networks where the content

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.710
is hosted allows an ISP to spread its

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.534
traffic. Across multiple transit links. Thereby potentially

00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:45.281
reducing the 95th percentile and lowering its

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:50.020
transit costs. On the other hand, there are other good reasons for ISPs to peer

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.200
with CDNs. First of all, providing content

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.750
closer to the ISP's customers allows the ISP

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.800
to provide the customers with good performance for

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.400
a particular service. For example. You could already

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.584
see that Georgia Tech has placed a

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:08.830
Google cache node, in its own network. Resulting

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.587
in very low latencies to Google. And thereby

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:15.129
happy customers. You can imagine that providing good

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:18.096
performance to popular services is a major selling

00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:21.730
point for ISPs. Another reason that ISPs like to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.860
peer with CDNs or host cache nodes locally

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.840
is to lower their transit costs. You can imagine.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.670
That if there are a huge demand for

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.640
a particular video on YouTube and all the requests

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.670
and responses were going over expensive transit links,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.560
then the ISPs cost would be potentially prohibitively high.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.111
On the other hand peering with the CDN, or hosting a local cache

00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:46.121
node, prevents all of that traffic

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:49.450
from traversing expensive links, thus reducing costs.
