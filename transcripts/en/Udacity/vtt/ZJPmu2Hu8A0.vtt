00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here is an example of an alternate starting point.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We could have started with the observation that, if I have a strain "foo"

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
contained within tags, contained within quotes, then the quotes are stripped

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but the tags are still there.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And from that we could have devised the hypothesis that tags in

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
double quotes are not stripped.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If we will take a look into our code, now again in the buggy version,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in order for the HTML markup to appear in the output, tag must be false.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In order to have tag remain false, quote must be set.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And quote can only be set in this line, and then this would also have left us

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with this precise condition to look at.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So although we start with a different hypothesis, we end in the same diagnosis,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we also end up with the same fix. And here we go.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So from our hypothesis, we can deduce the tag must be false,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
because otherwise the markup wouldn't be in the output.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Therefore, quote must be true, and therefore we have again our

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
erroneous condition, which sets quote.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Alternate starting hypothesis, same diagnosis, and same fix.
