With all the work that we've already done to load assets in a batch form, the

00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:06.600
code here is actually pretty simplistic. We take the input scripts array of

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.480
file names, pass it to load asset, and on the call back function we simply call

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.679
window.alert letting the user know that everything has been loaded.
