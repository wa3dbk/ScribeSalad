00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.785
So, since 7 is the number that we're multiplying by itself over and over again,

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:09.600
it is the base number, and it goes here as the big number that we write first.

00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:14.340
Now, we have four of these 7's multiplied together so the exponent that we want

00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:17.710
is 4. So that means that 7 times 7 times 7 times 7 equals 7 to the 4th power.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:22.590
Now, there are several different ways of saying this answer out loud. You can

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:27.299
say 7 to the 4th power 7 to the 4, 7 to the power of 4, or just 7 to the 4th.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:32.366
Certain other exponents have special names that we use, but they're pretty self

00:00:32.378 --> 00:00:37.464
explanatory. For example, 7 times 7 is equal to 7 to the 2nd power. But instead

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:42.148
of saying that, we might also say 7 squared, right here. In the same way, if we

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.494
have three 7's multiplied together, 7 times 7 times 7, we get 7 to the 3rd

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.793
power. But sometimes we say 7 cubed instead.
