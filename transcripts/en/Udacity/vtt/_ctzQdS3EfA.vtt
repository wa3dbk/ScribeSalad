00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.070
So our goal is to write code now, that computes

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.998
the formula that we worked out earlier. Then we want to compute

00:00:06.998 --> 00:00:10.250
the rank, for each page. The thing that we're going to do,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.920
instead of using this recursive definition, we're going to write a loop,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.950
that goes through the time steps, and we're going to figure out

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.590
how many time steps we want. The more time steps, the

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.430
more accurate rankings we'll have, but the longer it will take.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.180
So we'll just pick a value for the maximum number of

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.300
time steps, and we'll make our loops go through

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.310
those steps, computing these equations. So let's work out the

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.605
code to do that. So now that we've got the

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:37.390
graph. All that's left to do is figure out how

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.830
to use it, to compute the page ranks. So to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.310
do that, we'll make a procedure called compute_ranks. It takes

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.410
as input, a graph that gives the link structure. So,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.230
as an example we have our graph that has the

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.920
URLs, and each URL, followed by the link of pages that it links to. And this is

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.930
the graph that was produced by our crawler, and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.940
crawLweb produced as outputs, a graph as well as

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.390
an index. We're going to use the graph as

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.664
the input to compute_ranks. So the output from compute_ranks,

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:12.990
will be a dictionary, giving for each URL, the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.420
Urank, the ranking that we compute using our formula.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.360
And, the higher the rank, the better. And, what

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.520
we're going to do once we have those ranks, and this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.250
last part is going to be left as a homework

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.900
assignment for you. We're going to instead of having just look

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.012
up, we're going to have lookup_best. And lookup_best will take

00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:35.050
three inputs. It will take the keyword we're looking for.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.640
It will also take the index that came from the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.550
crawl, and it will also take the ranks, and from

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.000
those three inputs, the index will give us all

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.070
the pages that contain the keyword, and then what lookup_best

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.160
will do is, use the ranks to find the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.700
highest ranked page, and give that as the output. So

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.810
once we've done that, you'll have a complete search

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.020
engine. You'll have a crawler that starts from a seed,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.610
finds pages, produces an index, produces a graph. That

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.580
graph is the input to compute_ranks, compute_ranks uses our page

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.860
ranking algorithm to figure out the pages that

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.420
are most popular. And then lookup_best takes the graph

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.570
as input, the index as input, and the keyword,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.330
finds the pages that contain that keyword, and identifies

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.840
the one that's best, using the ranks. So that's

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.940
what you'll have after the homework of this unit.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.140
We're going to finish compute_ranks now, and leave it up

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.810
to you to define lookup_best as a homework question.
