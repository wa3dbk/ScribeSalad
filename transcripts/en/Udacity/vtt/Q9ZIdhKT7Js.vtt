00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I'm going to do now is read a short quote from Julian Seward,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the author of the Valgrind Tool.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you haven't used Valgrind and if you're a serious C++ developer, you really should.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 It's an amazing tool that runs dynamic checks on your running program.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and it looks for errors such as null pointer references, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
out-of-bounds array accesses, and other things.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
He said, "This code is absolutely loaded with assertions, and these are permanently enabled.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
As Valgrind has become more widely used, they have shown they worth,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
pulling up various bugs 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which would otherwise have appeared as hard-to-find segmentation faults.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I am of the view that it's acceptable to spend 5% 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of the total running time doing assertion checks."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, what Julian is saying here is that he's going to cost everybody 5% of total running time

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in order to make testing and debugging of Valgrind easier.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I've included this somewhat long quote because I really agree with Julian here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I think it's generally worth our time to try to make our code fail early, fail fast,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
rather than keeping going and failing in confusing ways later

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or even providing people with completely wrong results.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
On the other hand, let's imagine we're working at NASA or someplace like that,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and we're writing software that's going to be controlling a spaceship

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
as it lands on Mars or some other planet.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We have to ask ourselves the question do we want 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to enable assertions checks for this kind of a mission?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I actually talked to a NASA engineer some time ago

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
who had worked on the software for one of the Mars missions.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
What he told me was for most of the mission--

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that is to say for the launch phase, for the cruise phase, for orbiting Mars--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
they had plenty of assertions enabled in the actual mission software--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that is to say, in the software running on the spacecraft.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
On the other hand, for a short period of time during which the spacecraft

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
was actually landing they disabled all of the assertions

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
on the idea that they got only one shot to land on the planet

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and that if anything went wrong with the software during the landing process

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
it was better to just try to keep going, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
because an assertion violation leading to a system reset

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
could cause the lander to become unstable 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in such a way that it wouldn't have been recoverable.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That gives us a summary.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you're doing something so critical that it keeps going that it resembles landing

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
a spaceship on Mars, then go ahead and turn off assertions in your production software.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Otherwise, you're probably better off leaving them enabled.
