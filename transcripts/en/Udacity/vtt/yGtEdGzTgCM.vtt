00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.865
Now that you've seen one, let's see if you have the hang of it. Try finding the

00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:07.440
solution set for this inequality and write the solution in interval notation

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.900
here. As a hint, this solution will be a union, just like the last problem.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.930
We'll have two different regions.
