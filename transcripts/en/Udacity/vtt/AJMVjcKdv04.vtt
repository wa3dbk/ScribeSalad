00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.290
To make the coins yellow,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.720
first I'll use git show to look at the changes introduced by the color commit.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.670
Scrolling down, I can see that within the Ship, the color was set to navy and

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.010
solid was set to true.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.120
Similarly, within the Asteroid, the color was set to lightgray and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.820
solid was set to true.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.050
That probably means that I have to add lines like this to the coin object.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.030
Next, I want to compare the first commit before coins were introduced to

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.490
the final coin commit.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.990
I can find the IDs for those by using git log --graph --oneline.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.900
So I'll use git diff and here's the latest commit before the coins branch and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.540
here's the latest commit with coins.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.080
So if I scroll down a bit, there were a lot of changes, but

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.100
I can see that the coin was introduced here.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.830
So I'll open the file game.js and search for coin.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.632
And once I find the correct place, then I'll add the lines,

00:00:56.632 --> 00:01:01.270
this.color equals yellow and this.solid equals true.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.990
Now I'll save the file and check whether it worked.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.680
And here's a yellow coin, so it looks good.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.820
Now I'll double check what my changes were using git diff,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.870
add them and commit them.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.190
And I'll use the commit message, Make coins yellow.
