00:00:00.522 --> 00:00:01.138
All right,

00:00:01.138 --> 00:00:05.088
now that we've got the first demo loaded
up let's see what we've got here.

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:08.914
Well first what we've got is a README
file that actually contains the text

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:11.640
version of everything I've said so
far this level.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.542
So if you need a refresher,
well you know where to find one.

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:16.402
To find the real meat
of the demo though,

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:18.768
let's open up the the TODO
pane down at the bottom.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.589
Find a nice entry that says
TODO: Start here to learn more about

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.090
ApplicationListener and ShapeRenderer.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.163
Sounds good.

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:30.604
Let's close the rest of these panes so
we have some room to work with.

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:32.491
If you open up this file
on your own machine,

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.310
you may notice that there's a whole
bunch more comments in here.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.518
And again, that's more or less the text
version of what I'm about to tell you.

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:42.639
So the entry point into your
code that you write for

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:46.216
a game is a class that
implements ApplicationListener.

00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:50.558
ApplicationListener has six required
methods that we'll walk through.

00:00:50.558 --> 00:00:54.403
We've also inserted logging messages
that fire when each of those methods

00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:55.021
is called.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.015
So in this demo, first thing,
we're setting up a tag so

00:00:58.015 --> 00:01:00.131
that we can identify our log messages.

00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:03.194
And then we declare
a private shape renderer.

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:06.875
Create is the first one of the required
methods on an application listener and

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.990
that's basically where you do anything
you do in a normal constructor.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.028
This will get called when
the host application is ready for

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:16.263
your ApplicationListener to come alive.

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:19.503
And of course, this is where we
initialize our shape renderer.

00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:22.678
Immediately after our
application listener is create,

00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:26.260
resize will be called to let
us know how big the screen is.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.810
We won't be doing anything
with resize just for now, but

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.770
next level we will be using it to make
sure our camera doesn't go out of whack.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.609
Next, we have the dispose method.

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.539
Now, you might be thinking this is Java,

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.647
don't we get automatic
memory management?

00:01:39.647 --> 00:01:42.259
I thought garbage
collection was a thing.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.330
Well, while it's true that Java can
usually be relied upon to clean up

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.276
your memory for you, a garbage
collection event takes a long time.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.936
And when you have a game that trying
to render itself 60 times a second,

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:57.657
a garbage collection event can easily
make you drop a whole ton of frames.

00:01:57.657 --> 00:02:01.314
That makes it look like the game is
just frozen and users don't like that.

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:05.109
So, there's a number of places where
we have to manage our own memory.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.811
In this case, when our application
listener receives a call of dispose,

00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:11.510
we should dispose of any
resources that we are using.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.700
All right, the render method.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.930
This is the real heart of the operation.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.139
This gets called every time
our game should draw itself.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.077
So, you know how I said we didn't
have to talk to OpenGL directly?

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.468
Well, that's mostly true.

00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:30.930
These two lines clear
the previous screen.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.588
These lines get repeated pretty much
verbatim at the start of every render

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.251
method throughout this course.

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:39.791
The first line tells OpenGL, hey,
what's the background color?

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.310
In this case it's black, that's opaque.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.465
And the second line actually tells open
GL to go ahead and clear the screen.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:50.105
All right, then we tell shape
renderer to start a new batch and

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:52.492
we pass in the shape
type we want to draw.

00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:54.628
In this case we want to draw points.

00:02:54.628 --> 00:02:57.993
Then we draw point at location 100 100.

00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:01.927
So that's going to be 100 pixels
up from the bottom of the screen,

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:04.677
100 pixels right of
the left of the screen.

00:03:04.677 --> 00:03:08.400
And then, we've got to remember
to end our shape renderer batch.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.470
Pause is the second to last of the
required application listener methods.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.564
And it gets called right before
our application is disposed of.

00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:20.840
It can also be called when our app goes
offscreen and is no longer active.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.220
This will usually happen in Android
when you hit the home button.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.659
Pauses where we want to save anything we
want to persist about the game like how

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.519
many lives the player has left.

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.021
Resume gets called if the game comes
back to life after being paused.

00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:36.802
Again this is pretty much
an android specific thing and

00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:38.862
we'll talk much more about this later.

00:03:38.862 --> 00:03:43.540
All right so we expect this code to
draw a single point to the screen.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.465
Let's give it a try.

00:03:46.465 --> 00:03:49.086
All right, it's not much,
but there we go.

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:51.419
We've got a single point illuminated.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.350
It's kind of pretty kind of
like a star in the night sky.
