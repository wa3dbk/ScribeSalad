00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.620
So far we've strongly encouraged using
native elements because they give you

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.260
focus, keyboard support, and
built in semantics essentially for free.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.670
But there are instances when
native HTML won't cut it.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.980
The Web Accessibility Initiatives
Accessible Rich Internet Applications

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.320
spec is good for bridging areas
where there are accessibility

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.570
issues that can't be
managed with native HTML.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.930
I don't have time to keep saying the Web
Accessibility Initiatives Accessible

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.530
Rich Internet Applications
specification.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.310
So for the rest of the course, we'll
be calling it by its much friendlier

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.460
nickname, ARIA, but you'll often see
it referred to as Wai-Aria as well,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.130
which is helpful if you
want to search for it.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.120
Aria works by allowing you to
specify attributes on elements

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.610
which modify the way that element is
translated into the accessibility tree.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.060
Let's take a look at a really basic
example to show how this works.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.600
If we create a plain check
box we saw in less than three

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.883
that a screen readable
announcer as a check box,

00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:59.420
tell you its label if it has one and
tell you whether it is checked or not.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.010
And similarly uses of other assistive
technologies like voice control

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.155
will be able to operate it.

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:06.230
However, what happens if for

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.576
some reason we decide,we really need
to reimplement a basic checkbox?

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:14.230
Well, for a start, we know from lesson
two that we need to make it focusable

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.260
and handle the same keyboard
interactions as a native check box.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
But what happens if we then try
to use it with a screen reader?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.440
The screen reader gives us no
indication that the element is meant to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.840
be a check box.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.890
Sighted users can see the visual cues
which indicate the check box pattern,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.560
but nothing is announced
to screen reader users.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.160
Using ARIA allows us to tell the screen
reader that extra information.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.100
To give you an idea how it works, let's
look at this toy fake check box example.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.110
Just to clarify,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.740
there's very little reason you'd
ever want to write code like this.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.760
You're usually much better off
styling a regular check box, but

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.360
this gives us a taste of
what ARIA allows us to do.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.798
So I'll run Chrome Vox
light on this page,

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:55.328
to show what things are like
before we do anything.

00:01:55.328 --> 00:02:01.160
&gt;&gt; Tim-tams, mint slices.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.282
&gt;&gt; We have a checked and
unchecked custom check box up here.

00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:07.200
Chrome Vox reads out the labels
as tim-tams and mint slices,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.678
but doesn't give us any indication
that either one is a check box.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.632
If we compare that with
the native checkbox.

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.101
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Tim-Tams check box checked.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.913
[SOUND] Mint slices,
check box not checked.

00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:21.586
&gt;&gt; ChromeVox reads out the label,
the role, and the checked state of each,

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:25.495
and plays a small earcon, which is that
small sound effect you might have heard

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:29.430
at the start, to give a quick indication
of the role and checked state as well.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.228
So I'm going to pop open DevTools,
and add an ARIA role of check box and

00:02:37.228 --> 00:02:43.430
an ARIA-checked state to each
of those custom check boxes.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.930
So the first one gets
an aria-checked state of true and

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.559
the second one will get
an aria-checked state of false.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.520
Note that I need to explicitly specify
that aria-checked is true or false.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.560
Just adding the attribute
with an empty string,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.940
like we often do with other HTML
attributes, won't do the job.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.120
ARIA attributes always need
to have explicit values.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.860
So now we're going to
close the dev tools and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.000
start up Chomebook slide again.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.979
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] TIm-Tams checkbox checked,
[SOUND] mint slices check

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:18.479
box not checked,
[SOUND] Tim-Tams check box checked.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.445
&gt;&gt; So now we can hear that there's
really no difference from ChromeVox's

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:26.490
point of view, between the fake check
boxes and the native check boxes.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.027
They all sound identical, so

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:33.390
adding that role attribute and
that aria-checked attribute

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.010
causes the node in the accessibility
tree to have the desired role and state,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.340
without changing anything else about
that node's appearance or behavior.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.360
In terms of the accessibility tree,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.150
what ARIA does is allow you to
essentially do some tree surgery.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.440
We take the accessibility tree as
generated from the plain HTML tree,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.190
add ARIA and
get a different accessibility tree.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.560
It may be subtly different or

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.220
radically different depending on
what attributes we use and where.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.850
However, we need to keep in mind that
this is the only thing ARIA changes.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.140
It doesn't change anything about the
behavior of the element it's added to.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.450
For example, it's not going to
make the element focusable or

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.130
add keyboard event listeners.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.060
We still need to do the work by making
sure we're keeping the promise we're

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.370
making by telling assistive
technology that it has that role.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.140
We'll be looking closer at what that
means throughout this lesson, but

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.030
I'll point out right now that
it's no coincidence that we're

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.650
covering ARIA after the lesson
on focus and keyboard.
