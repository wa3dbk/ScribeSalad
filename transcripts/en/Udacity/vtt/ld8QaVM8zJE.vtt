00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.580
One thing you need to know right away about software processes

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.750
is that there's not just one single process, but there are multiple,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.840
possible processes, depending on your context, depending on the kind of

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.535
applications that you are developing. In this course, we are going to try

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:14.760
to cover the spectrum of the possible processes, as much as

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.900
possible, by focusing on four main software processes. The first one is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.480
what we call normally the waterfall process. And, we call it waterfall

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.490
because in the process we go from one phase to the other

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.300
in the same way in which water follows the flow

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.910
in a waterfall. The second process that we consider is what

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.580
we call evolutionary prototyping, and in this case, instead of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.790
following this set of rigid steps, all we're trying to do

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.930
is to start with an initial prototype and evolve it

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.670
based on the feedback from the customer. We will then move

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.150
towards a slightly more formal process, which is the rational unified

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.590
process or the unified software process. And this is a kind

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.040
of project heavily based on the use of UML, so we

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.263
will also cover UML when discussing this kind of project. Finally,

00:00:56.263 --> 00:00:58.680
the fourth kind of process we will consider is the family

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670
of agile software processes. And these are processes in which we

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.280
sacrifice the discipline a little bi,t in order to be more

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.380
flexible and be more able to account for changes and in

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.760
particular for changes in requirements. We are going to cover each

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.620
one of these four processes extensively in the rest of the class.
