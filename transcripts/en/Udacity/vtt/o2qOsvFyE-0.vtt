00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.384
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, the first equation is in slope intercept form. The slope is 4 and the

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:08.618
y-intercept is 7. This second one is a little bit tricky,. It is in slope

00:00:08.618 --> 00:00:13.142
intercept form. I know the slope is 3 and the y-intercept is actually 0. If I

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:17.730
add a 0 in the end, I don't change the equation, so this is also in the correct

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.047
form. This third option is not in slope intercept form. It's actually in

00:00:22.047 --> 00:00:25.867
standard form. It's a form we're going to learn about soon. We know it's not in

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:29.692
slope intercept form because we have a coefficient in front of the y. The y

00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:33.602
should be sought for, or it should be alone on one side of the equals sign. This

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:36.981
equation is also in slope intercept form. The slope is 1 3rd. And the

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:40.807
y-intercept is negative 4. Even though our form has a plus sign in it, I know I

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:45.250
can rewrite subtraction as adding the opposite. So, this is definitely in slope

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.295
intercept form. This fifth option is not in slope intercept form. I have a

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:53.637
coefficient of 3 in front of the y, so the y isn't solved for. And finally, this

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:58.074
last equation is in slope intercept form. Because remember, even though we don't

00:00:58.074 --> 00:01:02.221
write it, there's a 1 in front of a x. This is the coefficient, or the slope of

00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:06.702
our equation. If you got at least half of these right, excellent work. You've

00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:09.661
really got an understanding of slope intercept form.
