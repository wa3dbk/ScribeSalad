00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.859
Here is what I gather from the code.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.020
We are importing AV foundation at the very top.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.140
This tells me that we will use a library from this framework, and

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.670
sure enough, we use AV audio recorder which sounds like a library that

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.420
will help us record audio.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.920
If you look at how this object audio recorder is being initialized a little bit

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.440
further down the cord.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.170
We will notice that while creating its instance,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.380
we are giving it something called a filePath.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.570
Now this seems like the path, or the address,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.490
of a file on our phone where we actually want to record our audio, and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.040
it seems that this last line will actually record the audio.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.310
So far, so good.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.130
Let's investigate this thing called filePath a little bit more.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.370
Now, all of this code here, it seems to me, is helping us get to the filePath or

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.440
the location of our recorded audio.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.460
It looks like this line of code here is getting the path of

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.760
a directory within our app.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.030
Now the thing to notice here is that our app can't just

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.220
store a file anywhere on the phone.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.230
That would actually create serious security implications.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.210
So what we are doing is getting the path to the document directory

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.280
within our app.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.750
This is a place where our app is actually permitted to store files.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.510
Then we are getting the current date and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.130
time from the phone and converting it into this format.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.000
And it seems to me that we are using that as the name of our audio file.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.840
I think what this mechanism does, is that it ensures that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.890
no two audio files are of the same name in our documents directory folder.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.470
All right.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.090
Now that we have a high level understanding of this code,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.720
let's add this to our project and see if it works.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.540
By the way, all of this code is available in the instructor notes for

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.460
you to experiment with.
