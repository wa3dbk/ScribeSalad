00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.350
Now, we're going to display the notes.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.370
We have a storyboard, and

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.060
our storyboard has been updated with
a table VC, a table view controller.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.390
Also, we have a nodes view
controller class that inherits from

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.960
core data table view controller, and has
a pretty standard cell forRowIndexPath.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.870
We get the note, we get the cell and we
sync note and sell and return the sell.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.100
The interesting part really isn't
that prepare for say on notebooks VC.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.590
Let's take a look at it
the first thing we need

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.970
is a fetch request for the notes.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.520
Next, we need to specify how
we'd like them to be sorted, so

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.660
we going to do that by creationDate and
also by the text.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.900
The next step would be to create
the NSFetchedResultsController and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.530
we inject it into the notes view
controller and we can display it.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.680
Let's take a look at how this displays.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.840
So have the notebooks and
I'll select these notes,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.960
the ones in Coding Notes,
and we get them all.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.390
Instead of two, we get three.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.340
So what is missing here?

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.830
What's missing is a way to
filter only those notes that we

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.760
are interested in in this case those
that belong to the specific notebook.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.070
And the way to filter the circuit result
by adding an instance of an NS predicate

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.160
to our fetch request NS predicate is
a class that filters the search results.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.420
It can be configured with
a special micro language

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.400
called predicate query language.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.630
Don't worry about that.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.410
It's extremely simple.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.000
So let's add one to a fetched request.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.470
The easiest way to create an NS
predicate is with the format string.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.990
So in order to create the predicate
first of all we need to find

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.710
what's the exact notebook
that we're selecting

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.250
at this point because we will need
that information in order to filter.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.820
So first thing we get
the indexPathForSelectedRow and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.080
then with objectAtIndexPath
we obtain the Notebook.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.760
Always remember to cast it to Notebook.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.470
Once we have this you can go ahead and
create the predicate.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.200
The easiest way is using this
initialize and this predicate.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.060
And then, a format which is simply
a string, a kind of a template string,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.940
and an array of arguments of
objects that will be substituted or

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.530
inserted into the template.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.700
So the template simply states notebook,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.660
that means the property notebook,
of the note must be equal to.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.530
And this is a marker that says that
we're going to substitute here

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.430
an object.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.390
What object?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.470
The notebook.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.380
So it's that easy.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.650
We're just saying the notebook.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.630
Must be equal to this one and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.880
you're done add it to the fetch
request and if you run.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.350
You have two notes and
once we click here.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.870
We only get it.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.800
So yeah it's that simple,
check it out for yourself.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.100
And I also recommend you take a look
at the NSPredicate documentation

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.890
as you can create very
complex filters with it.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.840
We barely scratched the surface and
it's an extremely powerful class.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.200
Definitely a tool worth
having under your belt.
