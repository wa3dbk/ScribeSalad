00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.440
Let's have a look at these relationships, beginning with associations.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.010
Associations are denoted by solid lines connecting two class rectangles.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.530
Here's an example of a UML class diagram containing two relationships and

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.170
three classes. We have the Polygon class, the Point class, and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.260
a GraphicsBundle class. Between Polygon and Point,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.160
we have a association called Contains. That is a polygon contains points.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.800
The little filled triangle to the right of the word Contains means that,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.530
when reading aloud that particular relationship,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.700
you would read from left to right. So polygon contains point.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.220
You wouldn't say point contains polygon. You would say something like point is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.060
contained by polygon. The second association at the bottom,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.430
between GraphicsBundle and Polygon, isn't named directly. This is fine.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.960
We'll see that we can describe it using roles, which are ways of saying,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.890
giving similar information about how the association is relating the two,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.870
the two classes. There's lots of possible notational affordances for

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.210
associations. You can have a name, as in contains.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.930
You can have association classes. They weren't shown in this diagram, but

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.100
we'll look at them a little bit later. And you can have aggregation and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.715
composition. In the example, we saw both of these.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:52.450
The open diamond indicated aggregation and the closed,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.310
that is the filled diamond, indicated composition. In both cases,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.110
we are saying that the two classes are related by some kind of containment

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.380
relationship, that is a polygon is made up of points. We saw reading direction,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.570
that was the filled, filled triangle. We can also express Navigability,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.060
which is the appearance of an arrowhead on one end of, or

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.450
both ends of the association line. This indicates that the primary

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.540
access pattern for those classes is in the direction of the arrow.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.550
That is, we are going to be going normally from polygons to their points and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.760
not in the other direction. You can express multiplicity, in the,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.420
diagram we saw star. We saw 3 dot dot star. Star means any number of,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.860
instances. 3 dot dot star means between 3 and any number of instances.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.220
We also saw a property ordered which indicates that at least for

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.690
the case of the polygon and its points, those points are in a particular order.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.490
They might be, for example, in clockwise order.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.690
Not shown in the example diagram is the ability in UML to, UML class model

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.800
diagrams to express associations which involve more than two classes.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.840
In our text browser example, there were three classes involved and

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.940
we used a rhombus into which the various lines,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.150
the various lines come in to indicate all the participants within that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.450
particular association. We saw also the fact that you could have role names.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:58.190
The word bundle, adjacent to the graphics bundle class,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.220
indicates the graphics bundle is playing the role of bundle in that particular

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.500
association. You can have these role names on either or

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.440
both ends of the association line, or you don't need to have them at all.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.970
Also not shown, are the fact that you can express qualification.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.380
You can think of qualification as this as indicating what are the keys

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.600
into the set of instances. We'll see an example of that in a minute. And

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.370
you can express also, certain, Constraints on the association. For example,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.100
that they're ordered, that they're frozen, that is,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.820
the association can't change, that you can only add things to it and so on.
