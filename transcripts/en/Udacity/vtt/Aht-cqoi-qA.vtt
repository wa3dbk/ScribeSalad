00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this problem, given a list that possibly contains lists,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we want to count all of the elements in all of the lists.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So to go through an example, the black list has 2 elements.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This blue list has 3 elements, and the pink list has 2 more elements,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
leaving us with the total of 7 elements.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So this is what we want to compute, and we can take a second to think about

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
how we're going to do that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're basically going to start with the length of this list,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then we're going to iterate through each element

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and repeat the process for every sublist.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let me show you how that works.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We're going to start with our sum at 0,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and then we're going to iterate through each element.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
For every element we see, we increase the sum by 1,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and if it's a sublist, we're going to do deep_count on the sublist.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Once we've gone through every list, we're going to return the sum.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
[Mouth sound mimicing explosion] I've got to get like a catch word, like pow!
