00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.075
The learning goals, outcomes, and
assessments of this course all mention

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:06.020
the idea of contributing to
the field of educational technology.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.110
So it's really important that we ask,
what is educational technology?

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.260
Is educational technology
only the use of technology

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.940
in the context of learning?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.750
As far as we're concerned, no.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.570
For us, educational technologie
is any place for education and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.490
technology intersect.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.690
Even if it occurs far away from
the actual learning process.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.610
So, for example, we could use technology
to help the admissions process,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.980
to identify what students
are more likely to succeed.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.250
We can use technology to
facilitate registration.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.500
In fact, we already do, but
we can use it to make it better.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.763
We could use technology
to help load balance or

00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:36.606
anticipate what classes are going
to draw more students so

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:39.170
we can allocate our resources
more intelligently.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.683
We could use technology to facilitate
collaboration at a distance,

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:44.585
to help students work on group projects
together even when they're not located

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:45.440
in the same place.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.880
And there's also a big field that's not
the education using technology, but

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.920
it's the education of technology.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.530
Teaching students to use technology or
to program or things like that.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.120
So there are a lot of
places where education and

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.640
technology intersect that aren't right
there in the context of learning.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.230
And as far as we're concerned,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.660
they all fall under the umbrella
of educational technology.
