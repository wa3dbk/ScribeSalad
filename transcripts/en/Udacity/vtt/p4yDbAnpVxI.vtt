00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:07.275
crazy place full lots of little things that we didn't plan on coding in the

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:13.397
first place. And you'd be right. So the question I have for you is, do you wand

00:00:13.397 --> 00:00:18.522
to see how far the rabbit hole goes? Yes you do or no, you've really got other

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:23.510
stuff you need to worry about when making your game. Check whichever one you

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.420
feel applies.
