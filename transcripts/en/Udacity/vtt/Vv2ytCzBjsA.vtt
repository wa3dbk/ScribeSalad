One really awesome take away message about facial expressions is that they

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:09.450
don't only express emotions, they can actually amplify and regulate emotions.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.246
This is through what's called the facial feedback effect. This is the tendency

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:17.074
for facial expressions and the muscle activations that cause them to actually

00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:22.332
produce a corresponding feeling, such as happiness or anger. Now, I want you to

00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:27.465
try something. Grab a pen. If you don't have one, press pause and get one. And

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:31.668
take this pen and put it between your teeth, like this. Doing this activates

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:37.090
the muscles that make you smile. Then, I want you to grab the pen again and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.944
hold it between your lips, like this. Doing that activates the muscles that

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:49.322
make you frown. If I had you watch a video with a pen between your teeth like

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:53.418
this to activate a smile, and then watch another video with a pen between your

00:00:53.418 --> 00:00:57.514
teeth like this to make you frown, do you think that would actually affect how

00:00:57.514 --> 00:01:04.060
amusing you thought the video was. Yes or no.
