00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.512
If you said one solution, nice work. We can use our properties of equality to

00:00:04.524 --> 00:00:09.083
solve this equation, and we can figure out exactly how many answers there are.

00:00:09.187 --> 00:00:13.804
We subtract 2 from both sides, then we divide both sides by 3. So, x must equal

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:17.412
2. There's no other choice here. So, there's just one solution.
