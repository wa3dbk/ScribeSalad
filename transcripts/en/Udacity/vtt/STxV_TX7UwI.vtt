00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Alright, let's go ahead and take a look at this code.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.500
We start out by grabbing the length of the n by n matrix

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.000
that we're interested in, and we store that in n.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then we said v equaled -1; this is the vertex that we're currently looking at.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, for every element in the graph, every vertex in the graph,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we check if the assignment is none.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And if so, we set that to be the vertex that we are looking at right now.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Then we check, for each of those vertices, whether there is an edge

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
between that and any other vertices.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If there is, then either the assignment for i or j, the vertex we're starting at

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500
and the vertex we're ending at, should be 1.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.500
If both are zero, then this isn't going to work, so we return float infinity.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
Now if we fall through checking every single element, and we don't get

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.500
float infinity as a return value, then if v is still equal to -1,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
then we set the size equal to zero, and for every element in the assignment

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that is equal to 1, we increase the size of the vertex cover until we return the total size.
