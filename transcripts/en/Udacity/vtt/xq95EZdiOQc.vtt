Okay. I want to add one more piece to our URL's. And

00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:06.310
that's called a fragment. A fragment is separated from the rest of

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.290
the URL by a hash sign. A fragment is generally used

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.330
to reference a particular part of the page you are looking at.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.650
There are other fancier uses if you're, if you're going to do

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.430
some complex JavaScript things. But for our purposes, it's just there. And

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.080
all I really want you to know is that when you

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.710
see it in the URL, it is not sent to the server

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.270
when you make a request. The fragment purely exists in

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.953
the browser. If we had a URL with both queries and

00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:35.410
a fragment, I'll show you how that looks. When there are

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.210
query parameters, the fragment follows the query parameters. It comes last.
