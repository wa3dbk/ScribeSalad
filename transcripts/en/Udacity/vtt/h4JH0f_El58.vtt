00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.145
So now I have a question for you. It's going to involve the story from the last

00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:07.564
video, so if you weren't clear on that, listen to it again. In this scenario,

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:11.250
name the part that your selective attention, inattentional blindness, change

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.327
blindness, and cocktail party effect. Put the appropriate letters in the

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:19.700
appropriate box. Now, more than one image can represent a part of each one of

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.440
these. This might be a little bit difficult, but give it a try, or listen to

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.202
the story again and see if you can figure it out. If you can't get it, go on to

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:30.430
the solution video, and let's talk through it.
