00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.394
The 1st thing that I'm going to, in trying to simplify this expression, is to

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:08.523
look at each of the terms and figure out if I can squish it down at all. So

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.577
first, we have 15x squared, there's nothing that I can do to make that more

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.857
simple on its own, so I'm just going to rewrite it. Then 3x to the 7th, same

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.409
thing. Then I come to. Negative 7x times 2x. Now, there are definitely some

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:26.058
factors here that I can combine. If I rearrange the order of these things I can

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.625
put negative 7 and 2 next to each other and then the x's at the end. Negative 7

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:35.233
times 2 is negative 14, so I'll have a coefficient of negative 14. And then we

00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:40.062
have times x times x and we know that x times x is just. x to the 2nd power. So

00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:44.868
I can write that as well. Moving on we have negative 4 times 2x. We can again

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.933
combine the constant factors. So you have minus 8x, negative 5 times 4, 5 times

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:54.597
4 is 20. So we have negative 20 plus x times 3. We could just rearrange the

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.148
order of those two and then we have 3 times x. Which is just 3x, so plus 3x.

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.744
Great now each of the terms in and of itself is as simplified as it can get. The

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:08.329
next step is to figure out which terms are like terms. I'm also going to already

00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:12.455
start writing like terms next to each other in a modified version of the

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:17.595
equation. We have 2x squared terms, only 1x to the 7th term, 2x to the 1st terms

00:01:17.607 --> 00:01:22.385
and 1 constant term. Now I just need to combine the terms that I know are like

00:01:22.397 --> 00:01:27.215
terms. Remember that we add the coefficients of like terms together and then

00:01:27.227 --> 00:01:32.125
multiply by the variable. 15 minus 14 is 1, so we have 1 times x squared or just

00:01:32.302 --> 00:01:36.583
x squared, 3x to the 7th is on its own, it's not combined with anything else.

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:40.901
Negative 8 plus 3 is negative 5, times the variable x, and then we have our

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:45.509
constant term. So this right here is our final answer. Our long, not very pretty

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:49.589
expression, has been squished down to be something much more managable.
