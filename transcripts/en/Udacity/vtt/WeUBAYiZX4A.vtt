I said earlier that the reason we needed
to put parenthesis around 3w + 12n, or the

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:08.406
total amount of money that Grant would
have gained from the orders that have now

00:00:08.418 --> 00:00:12.561
been canceled, was because this is one sum
of money, we want to subtract the whole

00:00:12.573 --> 00:00:16.773
thing, not just part of it. If we didn't
have parenthesis here then we would only

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.853
be subtracting the money that he would
have earned from the wipers that are now

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:25.211
canceled, but we would still be adding the
amount of money that he would have gotte

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:28.692
from the nozzle orders that are now
canceled. But we know that both of these

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:32.131
sets of orders have been cancelled, so we
need to make sure that both of them are

00:00:32.144 --> 00:00:35.518
subtracted from the original sum of money.
So let's put those parentheses back.

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.745
However, I don't really want these
parentheses here in the end version of

00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:42.690
this expression, so we need to get rid of
them somehow. Intuitively like I just

00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:46.777
said, you want to subtract both this
quantity 3w the money from the cancelled

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.038
wiper orders and this quantity 12n the
money from the cancelled nozzle sales. So

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.291
we want to subtract both of them and if I
get rid of these parentheses I should just

00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:58.881
be able to switch this plus sign to a
minus sign and have the expression that.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.844
That I want. This makes sense. Here's our
original amount of money that Grant

00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:06.482
would've earned from all of the orders
that he had. And then we take away both

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:10.300
the wipers that he's not selling anymore
and the nozzles he's not selling anymore.

00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:13.938
That makes sense. Now the problem is
simple, you've done this so many times

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.754
before. You just need to rearrange the
order of the terms, so that like terms are

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:22.519
now. Next to each other and then simplify.
So, first we rearranged the order of the

00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.629
terms so that w terms are next to each
other and the n terms are next to each

00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:30.675
other and then we just add their
coefficients together and multiply it by

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:35.115
the proper variable. So 87-3 is 84 and the
variable there is w and 72-12 is 60 and

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:39.761
the variable there is n. So here's our
final answer. Answer, 84w + 60n. Awesome

00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:44.343
job. That quiz had a bunch of steps in i
t, and some new material. So if you got it

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:46.786
even partially right, that's really great.
