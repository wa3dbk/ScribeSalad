00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's try to reason these out since they're extra complicated.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Suppose you give me your finite state machine A.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here I've drawn all these dots to mean it could be bigger in the middle.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I don't get to know what it is. This is going to have to work for any finite state machine.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But I do know that it has a start state and an end state--a final state.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to draw another copy of A on my paper.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Then I'm going to go back to the first one and where it was a final state,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm going to make it not a final state, so I change this part.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then I'm going to add an epsilon transition here, and I'm going to erase this other start state arrow.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now I have a new finite state machine that accepts strings of the following form--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
there has to be some part x here that would've been accepted by A.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then there's some possibly different part y here that would be accepted by A again,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so in general I accept x epsilon y or just xy.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In fact, I can always do this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you give me any finite state machine, I can always make a twice as big finite state machine

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that accepts one string from you followed by one independent, separate string from you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
However, for this one it's going to be a little more complicated.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It turns out that the answer is only sometimes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let me give you an example for yes and an example for no.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Let's say the finite state machine you give me for big B just has one string in it--lowercase b.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll do the same trickery as before, and now I have a new finite state machine that accepts bb.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Since there is only one string in the language, I've now doubled it. This works fine.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I can do it at least once, but now here comes the evil part.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This upper example--this blue example--of B totally worked.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now I'm going give you an example for B that does not.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Here, B is a*x.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This finite state machine accepts the regular expression a*x.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Any number of a's, possibly zero, but then you need an x.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now, note the difference between this sentence and its earlier copy.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This requires exactly the same string double.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's imagine that I do complete this finite state machine construction--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the same sort of thing I've done before.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Now I'm going to write out some of the strings that would be in a*x twice.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Well, I could have no a's, so then I have no a's followed by an x.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Or I could have one a--that's looking okay so far.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Or I could have two a's, or I could have three a's.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This pattern should be looking ominous.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Or in general, if I were able to double this machine so that it accepted the same string both times

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
rather than a new string each time, I would be recognizing (a^n)x(a^n)x.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
For the same reason that a^Nb^n can't be recognized--it's not regular--neither can this.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Here we have one positive example and one negative example,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
so it only holds sometimes.

00:02:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This was super tricky. Do not feel bad if you didn't see this the first time.
