00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.290
So here we have our function, inName.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.650
It takes in a parameter called name, so when we take a name we want to call

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.610
trim, which removes the white space from the front and the back of that string.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.010
So our string currently will look something like this, we can

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.140
see that this string doesn't have any differentiation between the first name and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.170
the last name.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.570
So we have to call a function called split, and we pass in the character or

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.050
string that we want to split the source string from.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.760
So in this case, it's a space which occurs here between Sebastian and Thrun.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.830
Now when we call split, it returns an array of Sebastian and

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.440
Thrun, our next line here prints out that to the console.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.230
This next line, name one equals name one to

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.520
uppercase changes our last name to totally uppercase.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.230
So in this array down here, we have name zero and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.460
we have name one which has been turned into totally upper case.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.210
This next line is a little bit tricky.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.487
Let's take it piece by piece, name[0].slice(0,1).toUpperCase().

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:12.820
The .slice function takes in two parameters of where to start and

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.270
where to end in a string and creates a substring.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.640
So for this one in name[0] right here it's starting at position 0.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.220
It's converting that to upper case, which it already was,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.590
but our function doesn't have a way of knowing that and then it appends it to,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.660
to a slice starting at position one, and converting that string to lowercase.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.770
If you don't pass in a second parameter, it goes to the end of the string.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.920
So looking at this example again.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.680
We'll start at position one and go all the way to the end where the n is.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.350
So our last line takes those two values and appends them together.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.920
It return to the other string, and our string becomes.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.420
All done.
