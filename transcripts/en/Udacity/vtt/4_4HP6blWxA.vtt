00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.380
The world is awash in data.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.320
It's growing in exponential rates.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.520
People have even coined the term big
data to refer to this phenomenon,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.670
but can't quite agree
on what that means.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.810
What separates big data from what
I guess you could call everything

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.740
else little data.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.960
Caesar Hidalgo at MIT's media lab says
that to qualify for this distinction,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.450
data must be big in size,
resolution, and scope.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.722
To reframe this idea in a way that is
directly relevant to transforming health

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:40.360
care delivery systems,
data must represent many patients and

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.460
providers, must do so in great detail,
and must be combined with

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.460
other data to give a context within
which that care is delivered, and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.630
the external rules and policies within
which that delivery system must operate.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.080
The data must, in summary,
be sufficient to represent the behavior

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.810
of the complex adaptive health
care system we've been discussing.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.320
Where in the health IT landscape
might you best go to find big data

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.850
as we just defined it for health care?

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.160
Would that be in an enterprise EHR for
a major health system,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.165
all the installations of a specific
EMR in a state or region,

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:26.020
a service area health information
exchange, or none of these?
