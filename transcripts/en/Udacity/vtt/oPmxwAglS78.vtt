00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.200
Git user media, is also a bridge to

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.420
audio input. This means it's relatively straightforward to

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.520
input a voice memo recorder, or voice processing,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.550
through the web Audio API. Now, the Web Audio

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.940
API is a pretty huge subject, so we

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.410
won't really be going into it in this course.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.450
For more on the Web Audio API, check

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.430
out HTML5 rocks. Or webaudiodemos.outspot.com. I did briefly want

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.750
to mention though while we're on the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.880
topic of audio, mobile devices typically prevent

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.250
audio from auto playing. Audio elements need

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.780
to start playing in response to user input,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.330
like the full screen call we talked about earlier. On Safari, web audio is also

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.740
the same. You have to create the audio context in response to an input event.
