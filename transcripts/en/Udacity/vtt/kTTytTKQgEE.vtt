00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.830
At this point,

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.000
I want to do a review of what we've built thus far using the document outline.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.530
You will notice that there are two scenes in our app currently,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.190
one with the microphone button and the other one that is empty.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.180
If I expand this first scene, you will notice that it has the microphone button,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.820
the recording in progress label, and also the stop button.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.650
All of these three elements are enclosed within this view here, and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.620
this view is managed by this view controller over here.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.660
So if I slide out Utilities, we can actually confirm that the class that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.200
is managing or controlling this view is called ViewController.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.228
The second scene is empty right now,

00:00:39.228 --> 00:00:42.760
which means that it currently has nothing in its view.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.670
And its current view controller, if I slide out the utility area,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.678
I can see is the iOS class UIViewController.

00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:54.270
So another way to visualize this is to say that in the first scene,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.580
we have a view with several buttons.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.500
We also know that this view is controlled by a class we

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.970
made called ViewController.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.630
This class inherits from UIViewController, which is a class that Apple wrote.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.510
The second scene currently has an empty view,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.980
which is controlled by UIViewController directly.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.950
So we can easily spot views and view controllers in this image.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.020
You may notice, however, that the M of this acronym, or

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.870
model, is currently missing from our image.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.750
This is because we haven't recorded any audio just yet in our app.
