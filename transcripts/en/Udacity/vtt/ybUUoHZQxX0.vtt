00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.940
So we've been talking about simplifying terms in the context of simplifying

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.893
expressions for a while, and our whole goal with doing all this is to make our

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.796
expressions look prettier. To make them easier to read, but still let us know

00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:15.612
what kind of math we're talking about. So something we're doing a lot of is

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:20.045
taking shortcuts. In fact, most of the time that you do this, you probably don't

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:24.060
even realize that, that's what's happening. let's say for example that we have

00:00:24.072 --> 00:00:27.945
something like 2 plus 2, plus 2, plus 2, plus 2. So we have five 2's added

00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:32.072
together. Now normally if we wanted to express this quantity, we wouldn't write

00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:36.249
it this way. We wouldn't write all the 2's added together. Instead we would say,

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:40.302
okay, how many 2's do you want to add? 5, well that's just the same as 5 times

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:46.172
2, since we've added 2 to itself 5 times. So as it turns out, multiplication is

00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:51.408
actually just a major short cut to repeated addition. In the same way, we can

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.959
use exponents to indicate repeated multiplication of the same number. So let's

00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:01.598
say that instead of having 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 We have 5 2's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.453
multiplied together. In this case, we can use another kind of shortcut. We can

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:09.389
rewrite this using an exponent, Just like we talked about in the last quiz. You

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:13.382
may have already had a lot practice with exponents in previous courses, but just

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:17.267
in case you've forgotten exactly how they work, we're going to talk about that

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:21.285
right now. So let's write this, these 5 2's multiplied together, using

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:25.722
exponential notation. So we're going to start by identifying the number that we

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:29.918
want to multiply it by itself. So in that case this is 2. So let's write that

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.125
down, and then we count how many of these 2's are multiplied together. So we

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:38.255
know that we have 5, And we take that number 5, The number of 2s we're

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:42.520
multiplying. And we write that as a superscript of 2. So superscript is just a

00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:46.915
small number written to the upper right-hand corner of this other number. And we

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:51.215
call 2, the number that we're multiplying over and over again, the b ase number,

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:55.897
and we this little 5, its exponent. Now, since you're going to be entering most

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.951
of your answers on a computer for this class, or probably all of your answers,

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:04.262
actually, considering this is an online course, you're going to have to type in

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:08.366
answers with exponents in a special way. So what you do is you type in the base

00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:12.288
number, normally, so you would type in a 2. But then, in order to type the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.309
number that's in the exponent, or in order to indicate that this 5 is in this

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:20.669
exponent slot, we need to write a caret before the 5. So these are the three

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:25.425
keys that you will type, in order, to enter this exact answer on a computer.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:30.344
It's like this little arrow here is pointing up to indicate that this number

00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:35.430
that follows it is going to be in that higher elevated exponent position, as you

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:40.300
can see down here. Now if you have more than just a number in the exponent, then

00:02:40.312 --> 00:02:44.140
you put parentheses around the entire expression that you want to have

00:02:44.152 --> 00:02:44.922
positioned in that exponent spot.
