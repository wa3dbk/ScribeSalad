When I run this, we remember that this is the or operator,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so we get the set that is all of the elements--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
tomato, carrot, apple, orange, and broccoli. Great.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now I think you have a good understanding of what sets are.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is a powerful programming tool, and we're going to use it throughout CS212.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
There are other set operations, which you can read about in the link below this video.
