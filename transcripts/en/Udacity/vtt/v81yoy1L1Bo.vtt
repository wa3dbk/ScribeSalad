00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.589
There's one last thing I would
like to teach you today,

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.580
and it's called Template Inheritance.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.360
Now, we can make this quite complex, but
for our purposes we're just going to do

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.860
this simple thing that'll make
our templates much easier to use.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.180
If you notice on a web page,
let's draw one.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.470
Most web pages have a title and
a footer.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.670
And then they have some
content in the middle.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.850
This might be the page slash.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.120
And then you might have another
page that looks identical.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.839
Maybe this is the /about page.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.464
It also has a title.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:30.770
It also has a footer.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.110
The same title and the same footer,
and has some different content.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.350
When you generate in HTML, you don't
want to have to write the same title and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.030
the same footer over and over again.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.110
Just like in your code
when you use functions and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.800
classes to better organize your code, so

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.720
you don't have to write the same
piece of code over and over again.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.070
You can organize your
templates in the same way.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.940
And that's what I want to
talk about right now.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.850
You can use template inheritance.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.160
So you can have one template
that includes the header,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.436
and the footer and
then you can have a bunch of

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:07.590
subtemplates that redefine
the content in the middle.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.970
So here's how we're going to
organize our code now.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.478
So here's what we have
right now in our code.

00:01:11.478 --> 00:01:16.750
We have shopping_list.html, and
we have fizzbuzz.html, and these files

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.510
don't have anything in common, but we
want to add a little title to this page.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.700
We're going to make each of these
inherit from the base.html.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.547
And we're going to make each of
these inherit from base.html, and

00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:31.090
base.html's going to have
some common html that

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.970
these two templates will share to
make them match a little better.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.420
And I'll just go ahead and
show you an example of how to do this.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.195
So first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to make a new filed called

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:41.080
base.html.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.210
I'm going to go ahead and put in things
I want these files to have in common,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.500
and I'm also going to do
a proper HTML document this time.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.260
I saved it as base.html.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.732
Now remember,
HTML documents start with a doc type and

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:53.401
then we have the html tag.

00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:55.920
And then we have the head.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.230
And within the head,
we can have the title.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.650
And so,
both our pages will share this title.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.600
Within html, we have body.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.310
And now,
I'm going to add a new syntax here.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.030
Okay so then we have our body, open and
close, and then we close our html.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.860
This is basic structure
of an HTML document.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.330
And it's what goes inside body
that makes the page unique.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.350
And I wanted to change that title too,
while we're at it, but

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.880
let's just worry about the body.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.447
In jinja, the syntax that we can
use will look something like this.

00:02:24.447 --> 00:02:26.340
The syntax for creating a block, and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.402
a block is something that will be
shared amongst templates, you just say,

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:33.200
{ % block, and
then you give the block a name.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.470
In this case, we're going to call it
content, and then you can say endblock.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.180
And we can make each of our
templates use this block of content.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.050
So, let's show how we would use
this base.html in shopping_list.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.659
Let's add some code to our body that
all of our templates are going to

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.331
have in common.

00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:52.222
I'm going to add a little
header across the top.

00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:55.667
Okay so if it's add a little title that
we're going to put across the top of our

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.880
page, it's just an h1, and
I gave it a little extra styling.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.280
This is CSS.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.150
We gave it a background color of ddd,
and a foreground color of 888.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.760
This is kind of gray with a slightly
darker gray on top of it.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.930
I got rid of it's margin and
I gave it a height of 50px.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.660
Also I'm going to add
a little style to the body.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.470
This will make it layout
a little bit nicer, margin: 0.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.590
Okay, so let's go ahead and
use this template in our shopping_list.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.670
The syntax for this is quite simple.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.870
All we do is at the top of our
file we say extends "base.html".

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.560
This tells this template that we're
going to be a part of base.html.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.280
Now let's see what
this does in practice.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.970
Let me make sure everything is saved.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.090
Nothing here has changed and

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.550
our main handler, we're still
rendering shopping_list.html.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.390
Let's go to our front page.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.945
Okay, it's still quite a mess here,
let's reload this.

00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:49.365
Once I reload it, we can see that
the header that I wrote is here

00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:51.435
with the kind of grey
on grey background.

00:03:51.435 --> 00:03:52.375
But none of our content is here.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:54.205
Let's look at the source for this.

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:57.605
Okay, we basically see this
is our base.html file, but

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:00.815
we're not seeing any of that content
because that was in that block content,

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.260
and we didn't overwrite that.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.540
Let's go ahead and
take a look at our templates again.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.720
This is our base.html.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.980
This is basically what we were
seeing as the source in our browser.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.550
But our shopping_list.html hasn't
actually filled in this content yet.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.160
Let's see how we do that.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.100
All you do is here,
you say block content.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.540
And this line here, block and

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.000
then the name content,
matches this line here in base.html.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.430
And I've put a closing one
at the bottom, endblock.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.560
We save this file and
we go back to our browser.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.360
Then when I reload this page,
we see all of our stuff done here now,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.250
within our base.html template.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.310
And when we view the source,
we can see we have the base.html header.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.553
Then we can see we have our form
contents, here in the middle.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:51.110
And then we can have down here, it's
hard to see because of the scrolling,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.130
but the end of the base.html template.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.120
So, that's pretty handy.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.770
This allows us to separate the content
of our pages and the templates for

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.330
that content from
the surrounding content that

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.530
all of our other pages
might have in common.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.615
And I use this a lot in this course,
especially during the blog and

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:08.720
some of the other things.
