00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.671
The midpoint between 3,15 and 10, negative 2 is the point 6.5, 6.5. Of course,

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:09.342
you could write this as a fraction instead of a decimal too, if you wanted to.

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:14.180
But how do we get that? Well, in order to get halfway from here to here, we know

00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:18.780
that we need to go half as far both horizontally and vertically. Let's once

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:23.715
again start with the horizontal distance, or the distance in x. Our x

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:29.020
coordinates or our given points are 3 and 10. So halfway between 3 and 10 is

00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:34.215
what? Well, the distance from 3 to 10 is just 10 minus 3. So that means that

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:39.566
halfway between 10 and 3 is just 10 minus 3 over 2. And simplifying that gives

00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:44.652
us 7 halfs, or 3 and a half. This, however, is not our coordinate. This is just

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:49.613
the distance that we need to move from one point toward the other point. So to

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:54.815
figure out our actual coordinate, we need to start at one of our points and walk

00:00:54.827 --> 00:01:00.328
toward the other point this far. So our x coordinate is just equal to 3 plus 7

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.642
halves, which is just 13 over 2, or 6.5. Let's do the same thing for the y

00:01:05.654 --> 00:01:11.379
coordinate. Our y coordinates are 15 and negative 2. If we use our handy dandy

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:16.892
grid here to count how far this distance actually is, we can see that it is 2,

00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:23.495
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, plus 1 more to be even with this point, 17. So we each

00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:29.010
move 17 boxes vertically to get from negative 2 to 15. Half of that is just 17

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:34.365
over 2 or 8 and a half. But again, this is not actually our Y coordinate. This

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:39.859
is just the distance vertically between these 2 points. To find the coordinate,

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:44.828
we need to start at one of these points, and then move this vertical distance

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.780
toward the other. So if we start at 15, we need to move down 8 and a half, since

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:54.515
negative 2 is below 15. And this gives us a y coordinate of 13 over 2. Let's

00:01:54.527 --> 00:01:59.225
graph this point just as a sanity check. 6 point 5 6 point 5 should be right

00:01:59.237 --> 00:02:03.890
about here. And if we draw a line from our first point to our second point, we

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:08.280
see that this point does in fact lie on the line, and looks half way between

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:08.565
them.
