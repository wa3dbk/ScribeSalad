00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.886
Here are the answers, and great thinking if you got all three correct. For the

00:00:03.886 --> 00:00:06.692
first one, we want to multiply by the square root of 2 divided by the square

00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:10.770
root of 2. We really multiply by a form of 1 so that way we can change our

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.618
denominator to the square root of 2 squared. This allows us to take the square

00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:19.416
root, so we get 2 in our denominator. And this is what we mean when we

00:00:19.416 --> 00:00:24.361
rationalize a denominator. We multiply our fraction by a form of 1, so that way

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.935
our radical does not appear here. For the second one, we want to get rid of the

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:32.859
square root of y in this denominator. So we multiply the numerator and

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:37.120
denominator by the square root of y. This gives us the root of xy here, and the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.680
root of y squared here. Our factor of y appears twice inside of our square

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.134
root, so the root undoes our power and we're left with y. Notice, another

00:00:47.134 --> 00:00:53.280
fraction with no radical in the denominator. That's rationalizing. And finally,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.430
for this last one, we just want to multiply the numerator and denominator by

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.540
the square root of 2xy. Now you might be wondering, how did I get this. Well

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.180
there's an intermediate simplification step. In the numerator, we'll have 4

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.416
times the root of 2xy. In our denominator, we know if we multiply the same

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:14.435
square roots together, we'll just get the radicand, which is just 2xy. Now we

00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:19.883
simply 4 divided by 2 to get 2 divided by 1. Here's our final result.
