00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.698
We're going to use these prime factorizations to find the greatest common factor

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:09.395
for 216 and 192. The greatest common factor for these two terms, is the product

00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:13.670
of the lowest power of each of the factors that appears in each term. For

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.134
example, if we looked at 12, and 44, we could see that they both share a two to

00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:22.380
the second power. They don't share a power of three, and they don't share a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.357
power of 11. So two squared, or four, would be the greatest common factor for 12

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:31.880
and 44. So what do you think is the greatest common factor for these two

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.546
numbers? Write your answer in this box. You'll also want to simplify your

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:41.050
answer. For example, if you think two cubed times five is the greatest common

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.466
factor, you would really write that as 40, since two cubed is eight, and eight

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.454
times five is 40.
