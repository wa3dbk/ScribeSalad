00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.600
Now we are at the end of this lesson, and I

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.450
just want to wrap it up by summarizing what we've seen. We talked

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.340
about black-box testing, the testing of

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.760
software based on a functional specification,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.510
a description of the software rather than its code. We saw a

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.500
systematic way of doing that, that allows for breaking down the problem

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.140
of testing software, so the problem of going from this functional specification

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.540
to a set of test cases into smaller steps, more manageable steps.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.466
And we saw two main ways of doing this. One by identifying

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.304
relevant inputs for the main features in the system

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:31.802
and then deriving test case specifications and test cases from

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.180
this set of inputs. And the second way by

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.780
building a model for the main features of the system

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.210
and then using this model to decide how to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.680
test the system. In the next lesson, we are going

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.440
to discuss, how to do testing by looking inside the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.716
box? So, how to do testing in a white-box fashion.
