00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.090
Welcome to lesson two.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.700
By now, the shell doesn't look so
weird to you as it once did.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.960
You've used several shell commands and
you've seen their results.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.260
In this lesson, you'll learn
some more shell commands and

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.800
get practice using them.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.070
&gt;&gt; But first, since we're going
to be working with files and

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.890
directories a lot in
the rest of this course,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.480
let's talk a bit about files in Linux,
or more specifically, file names.
