00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.261
Now for the answer.

00:00:01.261 --> 00:00:05.000
At this point, n is equal to three, so we need to split the the input--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that is, the select tag--into three subsets.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We now have eight characters in here,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so the first subset has either two or three characters.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is not the right answer,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because we now need to remove these subsets.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the entire set. There's nothing removed in here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Over here there is not a 3rd removed but an entire half, namely the second half.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Therefore, this is wrong as well.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Over here, however, we have the first 3rd removed.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That is, the less than sign and the s have been removed.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This could possibly be a next test for delta debugging.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Other alternatives could also be the less than sign, the s, and the e,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which have been removed, but this option is not in here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The last option is just testing the last third of the input,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and this means that not only 1/3 but 2/3 are removed,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and this is also not in the description of the algorithm.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.104
This is the next test that delta debugging conducts.
