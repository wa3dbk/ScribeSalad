00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.530
So a word is just something that has meaning that speakers

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.290
of a language will understand. We could define words as just

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.460
what's in the dictionary, and then there would be a clear

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.440
answer for that. But certainly there are lots of things that

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.360
are words that aren't in the dictionary. And the important thing

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.530
about words is that we have rules for making new words.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.140
For example we have a rule that says if we have

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.310
a word, we can make a new word by adding counter in

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.240
front of the old word.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.415
I'm using the same notation that we used back in unit

00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:34.950
one. This is a BNF replacement grammar. If you need a refresher

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.750
on this, please go back to the video that introduced that

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.420
in unit one. But the basic property is that we can replace

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.690
what's on the left side with what's on the right side.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.020
So, anytime we have a word, we can replace it with counter-word.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.450
And the meaning of the new word is something that goes

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.110
against the original word. So, if we started with the word, intelligence,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.950
and I mean this in the sense of spy

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.340
craft. Not in terms of smarts. Well then, we can

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.680
use the rule. We can make the word, counter-intelligence. Intelligence

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.080
was a word. We added counter in front of it

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.350
to make counter-intelligence. And that means trying to thwart

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.910
intelligence from the enemy. We can use the rule again,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.230
so now this is a word, and we can replace

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.270
this word with counter in front of that word, and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.420
we get counter-counter-intelligence. And that would be trying

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.610
to thwart the enemy's counter intelligence, that's preventing you

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.340
from getting intelligence. And we could keep doing

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.060
that. We could have counter-counter-counter-intelligence. And so forth, and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.980
these are words that, once we get up

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.970
to at least three counters, it's not something that's

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.010
used before. But it's still something that has

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.400
a sensible meaning, and we could do this for

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.475
other words. So we saw that one of the very long words was this

00:01:50.475 --> 00:01:58.340
hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.120
And if you knew that this word meant fear of long words. Even if you've never

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.845
seen the words counter in front of that before. So now we can make the new word

00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:17.845
counter-hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.810
Quite a mouthful. But even though you've never seen

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.710
that word before. And I expect most of you

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.600
have never seen that word before. Well, you could

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.960
guess that this is something that goes against the fear

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.690
of long words. Maybe, there's some new medication that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.536
cures people of this phobia. And you could also figure

00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:43.336
out, well, if there was a counter-counter-hippo and so

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:48.355
forth phobia. Well that would be something that counteracts the

00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:51.450
counter-hippo, and that might be something where this

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.840
new drug doesn't work if you have too much

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.250
coffee. Then coffee would be a counter-counter-hippo so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.520
forth phobia. So the point is, because English has

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.930
this rule that allows us to make new

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.590
words from old words. There's no such thing as

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.170
the longest word, we can always make a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.510
longer word, starting from any word that we have.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.030
If you remember how BNF grammars work, then

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.040
you should be able to answer the next quiz.
