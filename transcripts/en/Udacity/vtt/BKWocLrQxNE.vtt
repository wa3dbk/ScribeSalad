00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.260
So here I am back at my code and I have pasted both the account_sid and the

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.730
Authorization Token, into my program. Now the next thing I want to change, is

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.000
the body of the text message. I will change it to something I actually want to

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.070
send which is, My name is Ron Burgandy?

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.530
With a question mark. Now for this 'to' number the commons in the code

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.350
suggests that I have to replace it with my

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.159
phone number. So, I'm going to select and change

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.590
this to my phone number with my country code.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.500
This by the way is also the number I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.930
registered with twilio previously. Then they say the from

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.460
number, I have to replace it with my Twilio

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.950
number. Now, I remember that Twilio actually gave me

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.790
a phone number, but I didn't quite save it.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.310
So, if I go back to my accounts page, and click

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:59.210
on Numbers. I can get my phone number from Twilio. All right,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.720
back to the code and now I can change that number along

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.140
with the country code. Next I will save and run my program

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.480
and this is the phone that I'm going to receive

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.940
the text message. So I'm just going to give my program

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.660
a few seconds op, there it is, there's my text

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.870
message. Let me read it. You probably can't read it but

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.540
it says my name is Ron Burgendy. Alright this just

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.930
blows my mind that a few lines of code like this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.260
can help us send a text message. Okay, so now

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.710
that this code has worked, let's figure out what's actually going

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.420
on with this code.
