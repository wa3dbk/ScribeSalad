00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's a quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Five guys and a monkey are stranded on an island.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
On the island are many coconut trees with many coconuts.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The guys and the monkeys spend all day collecting a huge pile of coconuts.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When night falls, they are all very tired except for the monkey,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and they all fall asleep after they agree 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to divide the divide the coconuts into 5 equals part the next morning

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and part different ways.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, in the middle of the night the first guy wakes up,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and he doesn't trust the others, so he decides to take his 5th right now and hide it,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but unfortunately, the number of coconuts is not divisible by 5.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
However, if he gives one to the monkey, then the remainder is divisible by 5.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So he takes his 5th and hides it in a safe place.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Afterward the guy falls asleep again.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The same scene now repeats 4 more times for each of the guys.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The next guy wakes up, realizes that remaining number is still not divisible by 5,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but if he gives a coconut to the monkey, who now holds 2 coconuts,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
then the remainder is divisible by 5, so he takes his 5th and hides it in a safe place.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now, the guys falls asleep again.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The next guy wakes up, he gives 1 coconut to the monkey,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
which makes the remainder divisible by 5.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
He takes his 5th and hides it in a safe place before he falls asleep.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The monkey now holds 3 coconuts.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The fourth guy wakes up--same story--he has to give one to them monkey.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
He takes his 5th, which of course now is much smaller than the original 5th

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and hides it and falls asleep.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Finally, the fifth guy wakes up, and again, the number of coconuts remaining

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is not divisible by 5, but as he gives 1 to the monkey, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the remainder becomes divisible by 5, so he takes his 5th and hides it in a safe place

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
before he falls asleep again.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
As the sun rises, all 5 guys wake up at the same time,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and they all realize the mountain of coconuts has shrunk substantially,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
but they can't say anything, because each of them took some away in the middle of the night.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So they decide to proceed as planned, but the number of coconuts, surprisingly,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
is not divisible by 5.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
By giving 1 more coconut to the monkey, the remainder is divisible by 5,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and each one takes his 5th, and then they part their ways,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
leaving the monkey behind.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Here's a question. How many coconuts has the monkey?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Well, no. That's easy.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
How many coconuts were there originally?
