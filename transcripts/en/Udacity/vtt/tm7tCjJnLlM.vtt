00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.780
So now that we know what the ROB's purpose is, let's do a ROB quiz. So

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.510
we need the ROB because we want to remember the program order until commit.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.350
Because we need a place to temporarily store the instruction's result until

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.850
commit, to serve as the name or tag for the result of the instruction.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.930
To store the source operands until the dispatch of the instruction. And

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.610
to determine which instruction goes to which execution unit. You should select

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.130
all of the correct answers here. There could be more than one that are correct.
