00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.470
We actually have full access to the DOM in the JavaScript console.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.540
If you type document, you can see what is returned is the entire DOM document.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.030
Contained within it, is the HTML of the page and the HTML tag.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.420
The other top level object available is the window.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.540
The window corresponds to the browser window and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.440
the document corresponds to the HTML page that's been loaded.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.830
One thing that you may want to do when working with D3 is select elements of

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.180
a web page either by something like their class, their ID or

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.030
even just what type of tag they are.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.650
But the way that D3 actually does its selections, is based on

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.390
the native DOM selection API that gets exposed through native JavaScript.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.510
If we would say, like to access a DOM mode by its ID,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.620
we can call the appropriate selector function on the document itself.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.010
If you notice here, if I type document.get,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.580
Chrome is smart enough to auto complete what function I might want, but

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.710
if there's multiple options it shows me all of them.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.260
As you can see here I can get an element by its ID.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.490
I can get multiple elements by their class name and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.840
get multiple elements by their name.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.460
I can get multiple elements by their tag name and so forth.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.140
Typically you never need to access the DOM from this low level of a function,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.750
due to the wealth of libraries that make selecting elements much

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.410
more convenient.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.320
One of the most popular is jQuery D3 has a very similar method of

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.880
selecting DOM nodes as jQuery does.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.260
But for now, let's start with the simplest and try to get an element by it's ID.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.310
If we try to get a footer, this is going to look for

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450
a DOM node that has ID equal to footer.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.740
And what we see here, is a div tag ID equal to footer, and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.320
we can expand this, and see everything that's contained with in it.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.300
The second and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.090
last query function, defined in the DOM is what's called querySelector.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.510
querySelector is actually much more general than getElementById, and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.620
is what D3 uses internally.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.440
querySelector allows us to use CSS select our syntax to grab DOM elements.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.970
If you're not familiar with CSS query selector syntax I recommend looking it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.420
up as its a very powerful syntax.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.380
The simplest and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.310
most commonly used CSS query selector is probably the class selector.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.510
If you prepend a dot to whatever class you're searching for,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.660
the document .QuerySelector, will find the DOM nodes that have a class,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.720
in this case of Viewer, Maine.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.910
As you can see here,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.340
Viewer, Maine, corresponds to the main window that the video player is in.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.400
And this is actually the same object that gets returned down here.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.440
Notice if I hover over the DOM node in the console or in the HTML frame up here

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.870
Chrome's smart enough to know that I'm trying to inspect the DOM node, in this

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.540
case a div with class viewer maine, and highlights it for me in the left pane
