What Athena really wants to do now is to find the area of this triangle that we

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.127
saw at the top of the building. This quantity a in our new equation for volume.

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:11.436
But how? Well, her life would be made much easier if she didn't have to worry

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:14.649
about this side length that's tacked onto the right side of the equation, 2x

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.981
plus 8. Now, if we want to get rid of this factor of 2x plus 8 on the right

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:23.650
hand side. What should we do to that equation? Should we subtract 2x plus 8

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.228
from the right-hand side? Should we subtract it from both sides? Should we

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.940
divide the right-hand side by 2x plus 8, or should be divide both sides by this

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.392
factor?
