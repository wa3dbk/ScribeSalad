00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.230
And how does this tie into your work?

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; So one of the things that my colleague and I have been working on, is a whole

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.330
entire book that actually attends to the role of technology in couple and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.125
family relationships. Because even though there's been a ton of research in the

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:18.675
field of communication in the field of of technology and cyber technologies and

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:24.137
digital stuff. There has been very little research in the field that looks at

00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:29.475
relationships in the context of technology. And technology in the context of

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:33.606
relationships. So what we did was write a book called The Couple and Family

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:38.202
Technology Framework Intimate Relationships in a Digital Age. And what we did

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:41.898
was we synthesized what little research there is in the field of relationships

00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:47.640
and technology. And then all of those other disciplines. Put it into one book.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.552
And we really try to get people to think about things like the role of

00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:56.370
technology in your sexual relationships with each other. is being friends, on a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.473
social networking site, for example, with an ex, is that okay? Is it not okay?

00:01:02.473 --> 00:01:08.354
is just chatting with people infidelitous? Is watching pornography a form of

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:13.990
infidelity? When is the appropriate age for children to get cell phones. when

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.698
should they be on social networking sites? Should they be playing games? How

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:21.860
will that influence them? How do we make sure that our kids have access to

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.160
comprehensive sex education. That we can monitor while blocking sites that we

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.699
don't want them to have access to because its not age appropriate yet. So, all

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:36.047
of these things are things that are really emerging. Couples, families,

00:01:36.047 --> 00:01:39.464
individuals are experiencing them, but there's been very little written about

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:44.244
it and not really a comprehensive way for people to look at it. And so our hope

00:01:44.244 --> 00:01:47.862
is that our book is going to be really a big step in in a beginning of of

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:53.924
really this revolution of this field of couple and family technology.

00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:57.326
&gt;&gt; Now if you're interested in learning more about any of these topics, which I

00:01:57.326 --> 00:02:00.674
highly suggest you do, check out Dr Markie Blumer's website or the book she

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:06.920
co-authored. Check out the instructor's notes section, where you'll find links

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.219
to information about Dr Blumer.
