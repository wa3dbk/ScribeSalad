00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.620
Okay let us do an exercise together.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.710
This time instead of showing that an object is an instance of a cup,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.050
we are going to try to show that an object is an instance of a Mug. So here is

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.330
the definition of a Mug. A mug is an object that is stable, enables drinking,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.210
and protects against heat. Notice that we have added one more element here,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.630
not only stable like a cup, not only enables drinking like a cup, but

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.760
also protects against heat. Here is an object, I will label in the cushion.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.190
The object is light and is made of clay. It has concavity and has a handle.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.970
The bottom's flat and the sides are thick. You can assume that the agent

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.150
knows about all four examples as earlier, the glass, the bowl, the brick, and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.100
the briefcase. [UNKNOWN] in this particular case the agent also knows about yet

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.730
another example, a Pot. The Pot carries liquid because it is concave,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.750
It limits heat transfer because it has thick sides and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.450
is made of clay. Your task is to. Build an explanation that shows,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.400
that this object is an instance of a Mug. Can we prove this?
