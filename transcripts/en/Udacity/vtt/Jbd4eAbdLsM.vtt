00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Assertions are an important enough topic  

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
that we're going to want to cover them separately.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What an assertion is is an executable check

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for a property that must be true of your code.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For the square root example that we have been using,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we're defining a function called "sqrt,"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which takes an argument.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We're going to use that argument to compute our result,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and here we're going to assert that the result is greater 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 than or equal to zero.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So let's return to the square root example we've been using.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here we're going to define a Python function called 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
sqrt, which takes an argument.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's going to be some code at the top which computes the result

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And now what we're going to assume is that if the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
argument to the square root was negative--this bailed

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
out with some sort of exception--so if we reach

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
this line in the code, then we successfully computed

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a square root result, and what we're going to do

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is assert that that result is greater than or equal to 0 and then return it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Why did we assert that the square root was always greater than or equal to 0?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Because we know, by definition, our square root function

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is returning the positive square root of its argument.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
At this point in the code, we know that 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
we must've computed a positive number.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So it's good to go ahead and assert that.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So let's look at some basic guidelines for

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 putting assertions into code.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The first rule is that assertions are not for error handling.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So, for example, it would've been a mistake

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
at the beginning of this routine probably

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to assert that (arg) was greater than or equal to 0.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That would reflect a condition that we want to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
handle with an exception--

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that is to say with Python's established error handling mechanism--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and not with an assertion.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The assertion that we put into the code asserts the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 result of our logic that we wrote as seen.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's not asserting something about

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the behavior of some other entity in the program.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That would generally be more in the domain of error checking.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Rule 2--and this is really important--

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is never make assertion calls that have side effects.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
An example of a side affecting assertion would be

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
asserting that a function foo returns the value of 0

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but where foo changes the value of global variable.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And the problem with side effects and assertions are

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
when we turn on optimization in Python,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
it's going to drop all of the assertions in our program.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So what we're going to have is a program

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which happens to work correctly,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because the assertion changes a value 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in some way that's needed.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But, on the other hand, when we turn on optimizations

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and drop all of the asserts, then

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the program's going to stop working.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And this makes the assertions worse than useless.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This is almost the worst possible thing you can do with an assertion

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is have an assertion in your code that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
changes the global state in some observable fashion.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So we definitely don't want to do this.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now rule 3 is we don't want to put 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
silly assertions into our code.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And let me give an example.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So here we're asserting that 1 + 1 = 2

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now is it conceivable that in some Python program,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
1 + 1 was not equal to 2?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Sure, it's conceivable if the Python interpreter is incredibly broken.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But, on the other hand, if the Python interpreter is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that broken, nothing is going to work.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Our program isn't going to run at all, so in any case,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
there's no point whatsoever in doing a silly assertion like this.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The best assertions are those which check

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
a nontrivial property that could be wrong

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but only if we actually made a mistake in our logic.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's not something that could be wrong

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
if the user did something wrong,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and it's not something that's wrong that's 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
just completely silly to check.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Now I'm going to let you guys write some assertions.
