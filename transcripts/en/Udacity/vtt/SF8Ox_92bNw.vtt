00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
Welcome to our extra challenged problems. This is

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.785
the first in will be a set of problems designed to

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:08.172
test, refresh, and reinforce the various skills we’ve

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:11.321
learned in the class. I recommend that if you’re still

00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:13.373
working through the class then you finish that first

00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:14.682
and then come back to this challenged problems

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:17.240
later. Before we get to the first problem, I want to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.639
tell a quick story.

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:20.822
I used to live in Chicago and I wanted to bike for

00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:24.058
my apartment in Lakeview down to work in the

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:26.853
Loop, so I did what anybody would do and I looked

00:00:26.853 --> 00:00:30.001
for directions online and the suggested route took

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.788
me along the Lake Shore bike path and basically

00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:38.981
cut across to work. This seems like a great route,

00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:41.899
it’s along the bike path, along the lake, which is a

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.147
very pretty ride, unfortunately it’s also a very

00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:46.911
popular place for people to walk, for people to run,

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:49.607
and for people to take the dogs for a walk and it’s

00:00:49.607 --> 00:00:51.567
actually a very hard place to bike.

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:53.934
The suggested route along the Lake Shore might

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:56.104
have been based on some factors such as

00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:58.883
distance or how hilly the route was and whether

00:00:58.883 --> 00:01:02.429
you want a bike path or a bike lane and there is

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.541
probably some other ones but they don’t take dogs

00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:08.067
into account. One possible solution is to find two

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.872
paths and then let the user choose between the

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:14.278
two options. If you’re curious, I ended up taking a

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:20.095
route down Clark Street and Wells Street to work.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:22.803
Now with that idea, in this assignment, we want

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:25.381
you to take a graph and a starting node and

00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:27.567
calculate the top two paths every node – every

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.121
other node in that graph. In addition to passing the

00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:31.860
greater you should try to write your algorithm as

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.541
efficiently as possible. There is a link to the form

00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:36.469
where you can discuss your approach and your

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.067
calculated run time. If you post code, please

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:42.746
explain what you are doing at each step and why?
