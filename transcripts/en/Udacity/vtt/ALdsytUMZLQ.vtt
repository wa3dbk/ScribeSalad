00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.117
We've looked at some exponential functions. But, now we're going to take a

00:00:04.117 --> 00:00:07.362
short break from them to look at representing very small and very large

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:11.356
numbers. Imagine you want to travel to the far, far regions of the known

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:16.075
universe. Out past Mars, right past Pluto, out past where Voyager is sending

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:21.290
back images, far beyond our own galaxy, past our nearest neighbor, Andromeda.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.849
On, and on, and on, traveling over. Well, traveling a very long distance, a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.290
distance so long that it's hard to express with words. We could write this out

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.958
as 5, another 5, and then 22 zeros if you want to talk about it in miles. In

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:41.560
kilometers, this would be 8, 8, and then 22 zeros, or perhaps you want to

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.902
examine some bacteria. How big is a tiny organism like this. If we wanted to

00:00:48.902 --> 00:00:56.405
talk about how long the bacteria is, we could write it like this, 0.0000005 m.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.187
Apart from it being really boring to write out all those zeros, it's easy to

00:01:00.187 --> 00:01:05.960
make a mistake when we write out numbers like this, and it's also hard to read.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.870
We really need a better way to write quantities like this. And guess what,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.417
there is one. It's called scientific notation. And as you've already seen, it's

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:18.955
very useful, especially when we're talking about very big and very small

00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:22.039
quantities. Let's get ready to talk about it.
