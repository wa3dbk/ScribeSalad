00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.610
Well, if you remember, we stopped execution with the JavaScript debugger,

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.340
in the original HTML source file.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.750
Looking back at the code, here, the debugger in line 19 paused execution.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.280
In the web console, we created and appended an new SVG, which we then

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.290
drew a chart in, all before continuing from the initial debugger statement.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.480
So when we stepped past the debugger statement at line 19, the original code got

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.930
run, which appended another svg to our page and added a second chart to it.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.100
Usually, this isn't too much of an issue, because in practice you don't develop

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.380
your final chart in this interactive way where you pause execution,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.380
write some code in your interactive console and then continue execution.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.800
Usually, a visitor comes to your graphic, the HTML gets loaded,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.170
and the JavaScript code gets run once.
