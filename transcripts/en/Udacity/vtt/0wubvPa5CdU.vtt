00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is our initial constraint would touch this guy over here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The one to second motion touches these things over here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The second to third, these guys, and then the landmark observation over here

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
puts something between x0 and the landmark

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that sits here, here, here, here again, and here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This observation over here puts something between x2 and the landmark--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
these guys over here and the guys over here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That means we have only the following places that are still 0.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This means there is no direct constraint between x2 and x0.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That is, there is no direct motion information between these guys,

00:00:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and there is no direct constraint between x1 and L, which is this guy is missing over here.
