Congratulations, we're at the end of Lesson 2.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.050
In this lesson, we looked at the App Engine

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.500
development cycle and how to create an App Engine

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.650
project. We also looked at Cloud Endpoints that allows

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.430
you to build a single backend that can work

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.370
with many different frontend device technologies. Together with Cloud

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.420
Endpoints, we explore the API explorer, that allows you

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.550
to test your backend and also other Google services.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.420
And finally, we got conference central up and running in

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.960
your App Engine project, which is great, you've got a real

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.660
application running in the Google Cloud now. In Lesson 3

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.150
we have a look at storage. It'll be fun. Join us.
