00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.243
This question was a bit tricky. Whenever we start factoring, we should remove

00:00:04.243 --> 00:00:09.256
the greatest common factor first. 9 is the greatest factor that goes into 9x

00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:14.150
squared and 36y squared. So I can factor that 9 out of my expression and I'll be

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.230
left with x squared minus 4y squared. So the first term is a perfect square

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.094
since x squared equals x squared, and the second term is also a perfect square

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:29.494
since 2y squared is 4y squared. We can factor this inside parenthesis using a+b

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:34.650
times a-b. When I write the factored form, I want to remember to keep my GCF, my

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.618
greatest common factor. That stays on the outside of the other parentheses. So

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:44.053
here's our factored expression. And in this case we have three different

00:00:44.053 --> 00:00:49.915
factors, one of them being the GCF of these terms. You might have thought to

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:54.655
factor this as 3x plus 6y times 3x minus 6y. There's a common factor of 3 in

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:58.762
this term, so we can factor it out. There's also a common factor of 3 in these

00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:03.104
two terms, so we can factor a 3 out from this parentheses as well. So I've 3

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:09.220
times x plus 2y times 3 times x minus 2y. And we can easily see by distributing

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.456
we'd wind up with these parentheses back from before. We know the order of

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:17.614
multiplication doesn't matter, so I can just multiply the 3 times 3 and then

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:21.382
list my other two factors. This would have been another way to get our same

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:25.629
result. If you want to avoid removing common factors between pairs of terms,

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:29.988
then it's best to factor out the GCF first. If we do that, then we won't need to

00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:31.093
do this in the end.
