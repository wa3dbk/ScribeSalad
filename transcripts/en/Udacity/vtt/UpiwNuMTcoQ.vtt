00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.945
First, we divide both sides of our equation by 5, to get x squared equals

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:08.281
positive 6. Next, we take the square root of both sides and we indicate the

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:12.956
plus or minus sign here. This gives us our answer of positive root 6 and

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:17.643
negative root 6. You could have also written the answer like this, root 6,

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:22.748
negative root 6. Or switch the order of these 2. So solving this equation isn't

00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:26.280
that much harder, you just have new symbol of plus or minus.
