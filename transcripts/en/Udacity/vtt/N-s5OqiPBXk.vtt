00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.900
So once you've set up
the billing account,

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.240
it's time to create a new project
using the Create Project button.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.940
Enter the human friendly name for
your application.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.540
I'm just going to call it My First Map.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.380
Then you enter the project ID.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.450
This ID needs to be unique across
all of Google's infrastructure, so

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.920
you'll need to get specific here.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.040
As you can see,
I've just called it udacityfirstmap1,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.080
because this isn't taken and
it's available.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.420
Then you select the billing account
that' you're going to use, and

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.370
if you remember when you're
setting up the billing account,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.000
you gave a profile name, and I have
a profile that I call My Cloud Project,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.370
and I'm just billing based off of that.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.980
Then you just click Create.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.480
As you can see,
it will take a few moments creating.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.850
But when it's done, you'll be
taken to the project dashboard.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.950
Now you can see I'm on
the project dashboard.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.200
So the first thing that I
want to do to enable maps,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.540
is to go to APIs off, then select APIs.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.900
And here's a number of APIs
that are available to me.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.900
But we can see there
are Google Maps APIs here.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.540
So I'm going to go to the Google Maps
Android API and I'm going to enable it.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.460
Now that it's enabled, the final
step is to set up the credentials.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.760
Over here I can click on the credentials
link, then under public API access,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.390
I'll create a new key.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.944
When it asks what type of key,

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:19.686
I'm going to select Android key
because I'm building an Android app.

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:23.286
It will give me a dialogue asking me for
the SHA1 that I got earlier,

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:25.490
followed by the name of my app.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.640
Because I'm not deploying this app,
or doing anything with it that would

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.430
require the certificates to check,
the restrictions are much looser.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.530
And one of these is that
the name doesn't really matter.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.980
But I am going to use the fully
qualified name of my app.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.050
The SHA fingerprint is what we
got in terminal earlier on.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.533
Let's take a look at that.

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.880
Here you can see my SHA1 key.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.060
So I'm just going to copy all of that,
and then I'm going to put a semi-colon,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.300
and after the semi-colon I'm
going to put the name of my app.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.140
In this case, it's
com.google.devplat.lmoroni.firstmap.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.030
Don't worry if you need
to change the name.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.280
You can do this later with the edit
allowed android applications button.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.366
But, I'll just create for now.

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:11.360
And we can see that my
key is listed here.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.490
And if I wanted to change my name,
I just say, Edit,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.340
allowed Android applications.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.169
And I can go ahead and change the name.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.790
The API key is listed at the top.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.880
Make a copy of that, or
keep the console open,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.810
because you'll be needing
that in the next step.
