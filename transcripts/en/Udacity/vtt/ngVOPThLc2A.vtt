00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.750
One way of thinking about this is to talk in terms of differences. This chart

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.960
illustrates the differences between different states and the goal state. So, for

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.000
example, if the current state was this one then this red line illustrates

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.220
the difference from the goal state. So we should pick an operator that will

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.430
help reduce the difference between the current state and the goal state.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.120
So the reduction between the difference with the current state and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.190
the goal state is the end. The application of the operator is the means.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.030
That's why it's called the means-ends analysis. At any given state,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm going to pick an operator that will help you deduce the difference between

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.330
the current state and the goal state. Note in a way this problem is similar to

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.330
the problem of part finding in robotics, where we have to design a robot that

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.210
could go from one point to another point in some navigation space.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.280
&gt;From my office to your office, for example, if all our offices were in the same

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.870
building. There too we would use the notion of distances between offices. Here

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.349
we using the notion of distance in a metaphorical sense, in a figurative sense,

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.570
not in a physical sense. So I'll sometimes use the word difference instead of

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.780
distance but it's the same idea. We are trying to deduce the distance or

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.530
the difference but in an abstract space. So going back to an example of going

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.210
from this initial state to this goal state. I can look at initial state and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.920
see that there are three differences between the initial state and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.050
the goal state. First, A is on table here, but A should be on B.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.260
B is on table here, but B should be on C. And third, C is on top of A here,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.180
the C should be on top, on table there. So three differences. Here the number of

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.180
operations are available to us. Nine operations in particular. Let us do

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.220
a means-end analysis. We can apply an operator that would put C on table.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.325
In which case the difference between the new state and the goal state will be

00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:01.940
two. We could apply an operator that will put C on top of B,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.590
in that case the difference between the current state and the goal state will

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.720
still be three. Or we can apply the operator putting B on top of C,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.830
in which case the distance between the current state and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.330
the goal state will be 2. Notice that the notion of reducing differences now

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.166
leads to two possible choices. One could go with this state or with this one.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:27.240
Means-end analysis by itself does not help an AI agent decide between this

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.570
course of action and that course of action. This is something that we

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.860
will return to, both a little bit later in this lesson and even much more in

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.120
detail when we come to planning in this course. For now, let us resume that we

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.150
choose the top course of action just like they had done already there. So

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.590
this chart illustrates the pot taken from the initial state to the goal state.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.755
And the important thing to notice here is that with each different move

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:58.135
the distance between the current state and the goal state is decreasing,

00:02:58.135 --> 00:03:03.276
from three to two to one to zero. This is why means-end analysis comes up

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:07.920
with this path because at each time it reduces a difference
