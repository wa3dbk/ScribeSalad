00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.240
Here's how I would suggest that
you handle disagreements around

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.220
best practice.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.270
Do the thing that the other
person wants to do first.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.740
That's always a good way, right?

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.790
Feels inclusive.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.260
It's going to feel terrible to you

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.280
because you're going to feel
like you know the right thing.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.250
It's going to feel awesome to them
because they're going to feel like

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.780
there's some trust and willingness.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.530
That's one way to go about it.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.610
Maybe an easier way to think about this

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.800
is that there's no such
thing as best practice.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.310
There are good practices
that are context bound.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.990
As a matter of fact, the things that you
are going to see that cause pain inside

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.930
of an organization or
that make the interactions

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.860
between the development staff and
the operations staff difficult.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.180
Those are actually the result
of earlier best practices.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.200
So the thing that we need to be very,
very clear about

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.180
is that there's only good practices and
those good practices have a lifespan.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.250
And so when you walk in the first
thing you want to do is you want to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.349
develop that sense of
appreciative inquiry.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.440
It's not, man how did it get like this?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.000
It's, I wonder how it got this way.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.990
What was the value that
drove the organization?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.370
What value were there chasing?

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.480
What things did they see as being
amazing that brought them to this place?

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.120
And how do we recapture the things
that we think are valuable?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.530
It's very, very easy to declare
the thing bad and then to

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.620
want to describe some new good state and
this is often how best practices work.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.960
I cannot tell you how many times
I have shown up on the site

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.100
to talk with some executives or
with a team and the first

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.850
thing they want to know is Jeff give me
the checklist of all the best practices.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.330
And in fact, I can't do that.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.170
Even if I wanted to and
often I do want to because it feels like

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.180
they would be super happy
if I could give it to them.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.940
I know that it's a little bit of a fib

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.770
that in fact what's going to have to
happen is the organization is going to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.040
have to work together to
find a set of tooling.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.650
That set of tooling is different
contextually from place to place.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.010
Different vendors take different
approaches to the problem domain and

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.640
some work better in some contexts and
others and in others and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.760
I think your job in the role of develops
engineer is to really to help to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.050
help the organization to discover
the right set of tooling.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.880
[LAUGH] Well,
what no organization needs right now

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.310
is another voice unlike
the war on which tool is best.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.170
It's an easy, easy trap for
a junior engineer to fall into.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.499
I would encourage you at the beginning
of your learning process to avoid it,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.360
avoid it.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.000
First of all, learn all the tools.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.570
There are differences in approach and

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.140
technique that are super valuable and
you never know when you're going to need

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.340
that sort of super special screwdriver
to solve that particular problem.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.040
So as a new engineer working in the
DevOp space, you're going to come into

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.930
an organization and often you're
going to come in with a list of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.125
like, these are all the best practices,
these are the best tools.

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:20.560
And it would be great if you just landed
at a place where everyone agreed.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.410
But in fact, what you're probably is
going to happen, is you're going to

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.060
land into a place where people are
already in sort of violent disagreement.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.080
And if what you bring is more advocacy.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.510
You're never going to get to
the place that you want to get,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.920
which is the ability
to unlock that value.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.530
So as it is it develops an engineer
in an organization that's

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.420
sort of can't find its
way toward a tool set.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.360
I think is taking the stance of
advocacy for any particular tool is

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960
not going to be the place where
where you're bringing value.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.570
The most valuable stance you
can take is the one in which

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.900
you help the organization to kind of
CO discover what works in its context.
