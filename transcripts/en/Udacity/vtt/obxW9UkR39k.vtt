00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.932
This works fine, but things can get a little bit more complex particularly once

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:09.040
you start wanting more data out of the collision. For instance, it's generally

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.870
useful to know the exact point of intersection. Now, let's take a bit of a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.792
closer look at that. So, the question I want to answer is, what point should we

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:22.214
single out for the specific point of intersection between these two? Should it

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:26.302
be over here, over here, right here, here, or here? Which point should we use

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:31.159
as the point of intersection? Check any that you think would be a good choice.
