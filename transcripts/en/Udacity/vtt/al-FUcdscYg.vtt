Since days are represented on the horizontal axis on this graph, what this

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:08.390
question is really asking is what vertical coordinate goes with the horizontal

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:12.715
coordinate of 7 on this graph. So we start by counting over 7 horizontally, and

00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:16.930
then moving up to find the point on the graph that has a horizontal coordinate

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:20.207
of 7. Then we just need to see what vertical coordinate this corresponds to.

00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:27.121
This is right above the line representing 160 for n, so that means the answer

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:32.133
must be 161. Remember to be super careful about which axis represents which

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:37.466
variable. What's even more interesting is comparing this to our equation. If we

00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:42.538
let d equal 7 here, or just substitute in 7 for d, and then solve for n, we get

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.083
161, which is exactly the point that we found on the graph. The equation and the

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:51.578
graph are just different ways of describing the same thing, so of course, they

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.346
have to agree.
