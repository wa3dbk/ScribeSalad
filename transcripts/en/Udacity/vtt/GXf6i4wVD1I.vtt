00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.692
Now, that we can receive the position of our physics object in the world, we

00:00:02.692 --> 00:00:05.316
have to figure out how to set the position of a physics body, which in contrast

00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:09.700
is a little bit trickier. Scrolling through the documentation, you'll most

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.400
likely see a nice API called set position, which will do exactly what you

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.100
think, and set the position physics body in the world, regardless of how

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.897
physics are acting upon it. Note that this type of teleportation will ignore

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:23.705
any types of collision that may occur before the position is set. In other

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:26.495
words, set position teleports you to the desired position first, and then

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:30.884
calculates the physics response. As such, you should only use set position when

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:34.710
you're intentionally trying to teleport, and, when you know where you're going.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.393
Imagine how Nightcrawler feels. So, in order to get moving with this, the first

00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:41.016
thing we need to do, is once the physBody has been created, we can actually

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:45.319
call the SetLinearVelocity function, on the physBody. Setting its initial

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:49.354
velocity vector, so this body can be simulated and updated properly. And if you

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:52.426
recall, we remove the velocity from objects each frame, in order to keep them

00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:56.965
from sliding around our world like hockey pucks. As such, any objects that want

00:00:56.965 --> 00:01:00.516
continuous movement, say for instance a rocket moving at a constant speed, need

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:05.740
to set the linear velocity of the physBody, each frame, to insure it's moving.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.535
We see a perfect example of this in the simple projectile class, which will set

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.560
the linear velocity, before sampling from the physBody.
