00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.546
Now, before when we talked about parabolas, we said that changing the

00:00:03.546 --> 00:00:08.670
coefficient out in front of the x squared changed the width of the parabola.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.891
Putting a fraction out in front, like 1 3rd or one half, made the graph really

00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:18.019
wide. And putting a bigger number like 2 or 3, a number greater than 1 as the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.747
coefficient, made the graph skinnier, like we see in C and D. However, let's

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:28.188
think about this from a vertical point of view instead now. Instead of thinking

00:00:28.188 --> 00:00:31.428
about these as making graphs wider or skinnier, we can think about these

00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:36.588
coefficients actually making the graph taller or shorter. Changing this

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:41.140
coefficient, changes what the y value is going to be for any given x value.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.794
Graph E down here, is our parent problem, y equals x squared. While we see that

00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:50.409
point 2 comma 4, here. On graph B, we can see that when the x coordinate is 2,

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.538
the y coordinate is not all the way up at 4. It's only halfway as tall. You can

00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:59.444
imagine that if I drew a vertical line going from the x-axis all the way up to

00:00:59.444 --> 00:01:03.161
where the line meets the graph, we can compare how tall graphs are to one

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:10.193
another by picking the same x value and then seeing how tall that line is. How

00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:15.266
many units in the y direction it takes to hit our graph. But, what determines

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:19.572
if a graph is stretching, like in graph D, or shrinking like in graph B?

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:24.039
Remember, this is in the y direction, the vertical direction. Something clearly

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.343
has to happen in their equations to make this happen in their graphs. let's use

00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:33.001
good old y equals x squared, as our starting point, the function that we're

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:38.020
going to transform. When x squared, in this function, is multiplied by a value

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.620
that is greater than zero but less than one, will the graph be vertically

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.059
stretched or vertically shrunk? Now, on the other hand, if x squared is

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:51.240
multiplied by a value that is greater than 1, what will happen to the graph?
