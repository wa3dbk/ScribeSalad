We'll that's enough abstract ideas for now without coverage.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, let's take a concrete look of what a coverage can do for us in practice.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
How it can help us do better testing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What are we going to do here is look at some random open source Python codes

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that implements a splay tree and before we go into the details

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
let me briefly explain what a splay tree is. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And broadly speaking a splay tree is just a kind of binary search tree.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And a binary search tree is a tree where every node has two leaves

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and it supports operations such as insert, delete, and lookup. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The main important thing about a binary search tree, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the keys have to support an order in relation. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And so an order in relation is anything that assigns a total ordering to all the keys in the space.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Just a simple example if we're using integers for keys then we can use less than for order in relation.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Or for example, if we're using words as our keys, then we can use dictionary order.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And so again, it doesn't matter what kind of a data type the key is in a binary search tree.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
All that really matters is the keys we're going to use to look up

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
elements in the tree have this order and relation.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The way the binary search tree is going to work is,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we're going to build up a tree under the invariant that the left child of any node 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
always has a key that's ordered before the key of the parent node

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and the right child is always ordered after the parent node using the ordering. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And so, hopefully which we can see now,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is that if we build up some sort of a large tree with this kind of shape,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we have a procedure for fast lookup.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And the way that lookup works is, when we're searching for a particular key

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in the binary search tree, we only have to walk one path from the root down to the leaves.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We always know which subtree might contain the key that we're looking for,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and of course, we have to actually go down into that subtree to see if it's there,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but the point is we only have to walk one path to the tree.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And the upside is that generally, operations on this kind of a search tree, 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we're going to require a number of tree operations logarithmic in the number of tree nodes. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So for example, we if we have a tree with a million nodes and if that tree that we build ends

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
up being relatively balanced, then usually, we're going to expect to do about log base two

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of a million tree operations as part of a lookup, or insert, or delete

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and so we're going to end up doing roughly 20 operations.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, you can see some speed number of operations is far lower than a number of nodes in a tree 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that this is generally considered to be an efficient kind of a data structure.
