00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.602
Athena started interning at an architecture firm, to learn the basics of

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:07.582
designing and planning for the construction of new buildings. This isn't just

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:11.592
any architecture firm, though. It just so happens to be the firm that designed

00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:15.570
the new office for Grant's gleaming glasses company. So we're going to go back

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.535
in time to follow Athena through the work that went into creating Grant's

00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:23.359
awesome new space. Since Athena is just getting used to being a part of the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.324
world of architecture at all, the firm gave her a pretty simple project to work

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:31.564
on first. Since Grant's such a fun guy, he wanted his office to have a separate

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:35.880
space, just for having fun. Thus, the fun room, which Athena get's to plan.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.360
Grant has picked out a very special wallpaper that he wants used in this room.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.518
And has a pattern that he wants to make sure is fully expressed on every wall,

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:48.514
but he also wants there to be natural light in the room. So he wants windows

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:52.887
along two of the walls. However, since he's not willing to sacrifice any of that

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:57.175
wallpaper pattern, the two walls with the windows on them are going to have to

00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:01.844
be longer than the other two walls. Let's call the distance from one wall to the

00:01:01.844 --> 00:01:06.367
edge of a window x. And assume that each of these windows are placed in the

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:11.010
center of either wall. So that there's a distance of x on either side. Now,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.916
since Grant loves natural light so much, he wants these windows to be really

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:18.758
big. In fact, he's already picked out, surprise, surprise, the exact windows

00:01:18.758 --> 00:01:23.565
that he wants. And they are each 3 meters across. Now, since we're calling each

00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:27.990
of these lengths of wall x, we know that this length of wall is going to be

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.640
equal to the sum of those two. So this is just 2x. Now, the thing that Athena

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.093
needs to figure out is how much carpet is going to need to be laid down in the

00:01:37.093 --> 00:01:41.330
fun room. So considering these side links and your understanding of, area of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.685
rectangles, please come up with an expression for the number of square meters of

00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:49.941
carpet Athena's going to need for this room. You could either multiply or not

00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.386
multiply out your answer.
