00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.046
IQ tests have been controversial over the years. One of the major concerns is,

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:09.680
are IQ rests reliable and valid measures of intelligence? Now the simple answer

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.162
to is an IQ test a reliable measure, is yes. IQ test will produce consistent,

00:00:15.162 --> 00:00:19.988
meaning reliable, scores over time. In fact, the reliability of IQ tests are

00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:24.217
among the highest in social sciences. Now, how they find this, is they look at

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:27.379
people's score at one point in their life, and then they compare it to their

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:32.159
score at another point in their life. And even though time has passed, they

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.110
find that the scores they have on IQ tests at different times are highly

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.702
correlated. This shows that it's reliable. However, just because it's reliable

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:44.080
doesn't mean there might not be problems with validity. So let's go back to

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.022
Susan to talk about the validity of an IQ test.
