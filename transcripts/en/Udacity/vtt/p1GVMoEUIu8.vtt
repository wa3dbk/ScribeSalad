00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.320
To answer this, you have to remember which symbols we used for the population

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.330
slope, and that's beta one. Since we're doing hypothesis testing for the slope,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.840
beta one will be the symbols we use when we represent our null and alternative

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.190
hypothesis. Just like before with all our other hypothesis tests, our null is

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.940
that, whatever we're doing the hypothesis test for, in this case the slope, is

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:31.450
equal to zero. And again, we could have a negative directional alternative or a

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.359
positive directional alternative, or a non-directional alternative.
