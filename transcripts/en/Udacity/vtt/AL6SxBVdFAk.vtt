OK, so the next step is for us to

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.920
understand how Python knows about this thing called the turtle.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.100
But before we do that, here's your task. I want

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.520
you to reproduce this entire code on your computer. And

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.200
oh, and by the way, you can customize this

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.880
turtle. You can change it's shape. You can also change

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.830
its color, and you can change the speed at which

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.000
it moves. Let me quickly save and show you the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.540
output. Alright. So it seems like we've changed a few

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.990
things about the turtle. Its color, which is yellow now,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.760
and shape and also its speed. Oh, by the way,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.170
if you need more information about how to customize your turtle.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.850
There are some helpful links in the instructor notes. After

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.630
you have created your own custom square I want you to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.280
take a screenshot of your output and post that on

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.080
the forum. Make sure to check this box before you continue.
