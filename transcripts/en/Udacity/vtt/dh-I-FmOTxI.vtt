What do you think is the biggest challenge facing the field of interactive rendering at this point?

00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:07.537
I think it's mobile graphics. Everything seems, everything is going in that

00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:11.206
direction right now. Things are moving away from the desktop onto the pads and

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:16.364
the phones. And when you go from a standpoint of trying to get performance per

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:21.165
dollar or performance per, in the, in the film industry it's performance for

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:24.930
BTU of cooling capacity.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.280
[LAUGH]

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.430
And now we're going into, performance per watt of power that you can have, on

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.144
your device. It, that's a really interesting challenge for how to get what you

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:37.255
want on your device for that little tiny bit of power.

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:42.924
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Managing complexity. We have so much high definition data, like. Sometimes you

00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:46.401
just want to render a house but the bolts in the house all contain a million

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:52.496
polygons. How do you turn that rich information into something that is just the

00:00:52.496 --> 00:01:00.380
most important for rendering a pretty image? I think that's the big thing.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.223
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think in my field, coming from that, that maker, everyone is a designer,

00:01:04.223 --> 00:01:08.381
standpoint, is, is that, that play between 3D printing, and physical objects,

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:12.287
and rendering, and the, the hardship that is when I create something on the

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:20.068
screen, I can do it in whatever I want. When I create that reality, sometimes

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:20.731
the reality doesn't

00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:21.004
[LAUGH]

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:22.570
match up with the rendering.
