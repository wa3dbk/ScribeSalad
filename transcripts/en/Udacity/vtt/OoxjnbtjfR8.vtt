00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.154
These are our 3 answers. Fantastic work if you've figured those out. For our

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:09.730
first problem we want to combine the routes of 5. So we'll have 2 square roots

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.480
of 5 minus 5 square roots of 5. When we subtract 2 minus 5 we'll get negative 3

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.548
groups of 5. For the roots of 11 we'll have 4 root 11 minus 1 root 11. Keep in

00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:25.271
mind that there's a 1 in front of this square root of 11. So, when we subtract

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:30.790
4 minus 1 we'll get positive 3 times root 11. This second one is really tricky.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.874
You want to pay attention to the index of the radicals and the radicands. Here

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:40.689
the index is a 2. But here the index is a 3. This means that these 2 radicals

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:45.590
are not like terms. We have a square root of 2 and a cubed root of 2. This

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.524
means that we can't add the 2 terms together which means we just list them as a

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:53.732
sum. It might have been easy to make the mistake of writing 10 root 2. Or 10

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:58.532
times the cubed root of 2. But again, the indexes are not the same. So these

00:00:58.532 --> 00:01:03.450
would not be correct. For our third one, we want to combine the 5th roots of x.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.392
The indexes are 5, all match. And the radicand are all x. So we have like

00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:14.554
terms. So I have 3 plus 5 plus 1 times the 5th root of x. This would make 9

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:20.900
times the 5th 3 of x and our answer. This positive 3 is not like terms with

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.153
anything else so we just carry it on and add it to the sum in our final answer.
