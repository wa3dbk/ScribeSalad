To make it a little bit easier to visually differentiate between our lines, I've

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:08.515
redrawn our graph and changed teh scale on either axis. So that we're only

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:12.840
looking at a portion of the points that we were looking at before. I've also now

00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:17.140
color coded the lines to go with the different brands of solution. So brand one

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:21.675
over here, which is written in dark grey, has the grey line on the graph. Brand

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:26.564
two is in blue, and brand three is in orange. Now, using the techniques that we

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:31.860
learned in the last lesson to calculate slope from points, can you calculate the

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:34.051
slope of each of these three lines?
