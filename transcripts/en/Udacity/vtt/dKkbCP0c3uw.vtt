00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.033
So part of figuring out how to solve word
problems well is figuring out what

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:08.193
information isn't important for the
question that we're trying to answer. We

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:12.487
want to know how much money Grant's going
to make from selling nozzles. All that

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.772
this is going to depend on is the price
per nozzle and how many people want to buy

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:21.032
nozzles. That means that these answers
with 36, which has to do with the people

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:26.638
who want to buy wipers are irrelevant for
this question. Also w is the price per

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.523
wiper set not per nozzle, so this answer
which depends on w can't be correct. And

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:38.206
this one even though it also involves an
n, involves a w so, it can't be right

00:00:38.218 --> 00:00:44.090
either. We're only focusing on nozzle
sales here. So what are we left with 11,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.445
11 times 2 and 22 and 11n. Well, this looks
pretty good nothing having to do

00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:55.540
explicitly with wiper sales. However,
these 2 answers 11 and 22 don't involve an

00:00:55.552 --> 00:01:01.403
n. That will mean that no amount or how
many nozles Grant sells, he's going to

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:06.973
make either just $11 or $22. I would hope
that, for his sake, the more nozzles he

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:12.624
sells, the more money he makes so we want
to say that those answers aren't correct.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:18.403
So now we have 11 times 2n and 11n. The key here
is remembering that each of these eleven

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:24.545
people want two nozzles. Not just one
nozzle. So each person who buys two

00:01:24.557 --> 00:01:31.395
nozzles is going to pay him not n dollars
but 2n dollars. If 11 people paying 2n

00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:36.332
dollars so that means we need 11 times 2n which
is this answer right here.
