00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.320
You might have done some mental math or you might have shown all the work.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.758
Either way, the final answer is negative 1, 0, and 1. First, I factor 6z out

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:13.151
from both terms. This is the greatest common factor. Next, we factor this

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:18.176
difference of two squares. You have a squared minus b squared. So I can write z

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:24.075
plus 1 and Z minus 1. And we know the product of these factors equals 0. We set

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:29.470
each of the factors equal to 0 and then we solve for z. So z could equal 0,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.876
negative 1, or positive 1.
