00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.320
Now, let's look at use cases in a little more detail.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.480
And start by defining exactly what an actor is. An actor

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.710
represents an entity, which can be a human or a device,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.750
that plays a role within my system, so that interacts with my

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.660
system. It's some entity from the outside world, with respect to

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.510
my system, that interacts with my system. It is important to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.750
clarify that an entity can play more than one role. For

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.240
example, you might have somebody working in a bank that can be

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.400
both an employee of the bank, or a customer of

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.280
the bank, depending on how it interacts with the banking

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.360
system. And, obviously, more than one entity can play the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.570
same role. Using the same example, we can have both an

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.350
employee of the bank and just a regular customer, playing

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.280
the role of the customer. So again, it all depends on

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.120
what the entity does, how the entity interacts with the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.150
system, what kind of functionality of the system the entity uses.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.270
And finally, actors may appear in more than one use case.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.930
So it's fairly normal for the same actor to interact with

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.540
the system in different ways. And therefore, to appear in more

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.710
than one use case. Just think about the use cases in

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.230
scenarios of usage. If the same actor can interact with the

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.440
system in different ways, that actor will appear in multiple use

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.210
cases. Now let's go back to the description of our course

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.140
management system, and see how we can identify actors in the system.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.500
And as we did for the class diagram before, I encourage

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.160
you to stop the video and try to identify the actors

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.301
in the system yourself, before I do it.

00:01:23.475 --> 00:01:27.250
If we look at the description, we can see that, for example, the Registration

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.890
Manager is clearly an actor for the system. Students are actors

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.400
for the system. Professors are actors for the system. And notice

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.060
that we're not doing the same thing that we were doing

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.360
when identifying classes. Here we're identifying

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.460
entities that are from the outside

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.090
world, and have an active role in interacting with my

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.830
system. Again, Registration Manager, that we will just call registrar for

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.660
simplicity, students, and professors. So once we have identified the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.760
actors for our example, we can simply draw them, using the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.550
notation that we just introduced. So we have the registrar,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.830
and notice how for every actor we clarify the role that

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.450
the actor plays. We have the professor, and we have

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.480
the student. So here, these are the three actors that we

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.000
identified for our system.
