00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.939
Thanks Lauren. First let's look at delusions. Delusions are often bizarre and

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.645
grandiose and they are part of a patently false belief system that is

00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:12.870
maintained in spite of its irrationality, for example a person may believe he

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.900
is Jesus Christ and moreover these appear to be very real to that person, so

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.750
that person would actually believe that he was in fact Jesus Christ. We also

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.580
have hallucinations and these are convincing sensory experieneces that occur in

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.406
the absence of an external stimulus. Auditory hallucinations are the most

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:40.010
common and involve hearing voices inside their head often telling them negative

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.561
things about themselves or even sometimes telling the person to injure another

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:49.586
individual. However, some people with schizophrenia have reported that there

00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:54.424
are sometimes more positive voices in their heads, in terms of intentions. We

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:58.502
can also have a visual hallucinations. This involves seeing things that aren't

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:03.238
really there. There can be tactile hallucinations. And this involves feeling

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:07.019
something that isn't there. And finally, we can even have olfactory

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:11.691
hallucinations, which is smelling something that isn't there, either. Delusions

00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:15.723
and hallucinations are considered positive symptoms because they are not

00:01:15.723 --> 00:01:18.310
present in people in general.
