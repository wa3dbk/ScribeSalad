00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.900
Here's a graphic that describes one approach to web services.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.480
This one provided by J2EE, which is Oracle's technology for

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.490
dealing with new situations. Three remaining components on the left is your

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.410
web browser, which is going to be using HTMLs or applet's, or

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.750
possibly even application. On the right, is some kind of database services, and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.010
in between is where the beef is, as far as Oracle is concerned. And that's what

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.560
holds the business logic. This is the computational segment, that knows

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.060
about the particular application computations. And the way that J2EE has it,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.510
there's two parts. One is a web server, and the other is the EJB containers.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.070
EJB is enterprise java beans which is libraries are API within Java.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.980
Standard interactions then apply, and presumably you can build your

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.000
applications using this technology, in a way that can deal with some of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.960
the non-functional constraints that these applications have to be constructed.
