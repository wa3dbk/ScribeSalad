00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's work this out.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What I'm really asking you is the probability of a fair coin "f" given that I observed H.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This has nothing to do with total probability

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and all with Bayes Rules, because I'm talking about observations.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The non-normalized probability according to Bayes Rule is obtained as follows:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the probability of observing H for the fair coin is 0.5,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the probability of having grabbed the fair coin is 0.5 as well.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The non-normalized probability of not F given H, which is the loaded coin,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is probability of H given not f,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which we know to be 0.1--that's the one over here--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
times the probability of not picking the fair coin, which is 0.5,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
ends up to be 0.05.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
When we now normalize, we α = 0.25 + 0.05, which is 0.3.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If we now normalize the 0.25 over here with the 0.3, we get 0.833,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which is the same as 5/6.

00:01:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's our posterior probability we hold the fair coin after we observed H.
