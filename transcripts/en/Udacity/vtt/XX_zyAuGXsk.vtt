00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.650
It turns out that TCP is not a good fit for congestion control for streaming

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.710
video, or streaming audio. TCP retransmits lost packets,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.930
but retransmissions may not always be useful. TCP

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.280
also slows down its sending rate after

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.860
packet loss, which may cause starvation of the

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.240
client. There's also a fair amount of overhead

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.275
in the protocol. A TCP header of 20

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.530
bytes for every packet is large for audio

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.310
samples. And sending acknowledgements for every other packet

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.100
may be more feedback than is needed. Instead,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.050
one might consider using UDP. UDP does not retransmit

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.500
lost packets and it does not automatically adapt

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.330
the sending rate. It also has a smaller header.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.400
Because UDP does not automatically retransmit packets or

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.890
adjust the sending rate, many things are left to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.580
higher layers. Potentially the application, such as when

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.510
to transmit the data, how to encapsulate it, whether

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.470
to retransmit, and whether to adapt the sending

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.080
rate, or to adapt the quality of the video

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.619
or audio encoding. So higher layers must solve

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.860
these problems. In particular, the sending rate still needs

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.610
to be friendly or fair to other TCP senders,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.130
which may be sharing the link. There are a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.400
variety of video streaming and audio streaming transport

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.590
protocols that are built on top of UDP, that

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.665
allows senders to figure out when and how to

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:29.956
retransmit lost packets and how to adjust sending rates.
