Say I'm interested in finding out if giving my coworkers high fives makes them

00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:08.100
happier. I'll set up an experiment. I'll give half of them high fives and the

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.690
other half no high fives. Then as my measure of happiness, I'll see which group

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.568
smiles more.
