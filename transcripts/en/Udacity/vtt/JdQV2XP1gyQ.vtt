Before we move on and
create more complex tasks,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.000
let's talk a bit about
the concept of streams in Gulp.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Other built systems, like Grunt,
have tabbed their copier

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.710
files to a temporary place where
they make some change on them.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.050
As a result, every task incurs a penalty
for I/O in file system operations.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.588
Gulp on the other hand, converts your
input files into an in memory stream.

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:32.070
So the I/O is only done initially,
and at the very end of all tasks.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.890
This is what gives Gulp such a great
speed increase in many situations.
