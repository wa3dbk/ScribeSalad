00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.612
This hyperbola is centered at 0,0. It has an a value of 3 and a b value of

00:00:05.612 --> 00:00:11.770
positive 5. Nice work if you got these correct. Now, let's check your graph.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.457
We'll start with an ellipse. So, this ellipse will be centered at the origin

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:20.965
and will go 3 units in the x direction. And 5 units in the y direction. We'll

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:24.100
draw a dashed box around our ellipse, so that way we can start to draw a

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.274
hyperbola. Next, we'll draw in our two diagonals across our rectangle. We want

00:00:30.274 --> 00:00:33.460
to extend these along the graph, so that way we can draw in our hyperbola

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.725
branches. So now we're ready to cut the ellipse open. We turn each of the

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:43.781
pieces out. And then we can see we have our hyperbola. And notice again, that

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:49.316
we can get our rectangle, just by looking at the a value and the b value. We

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:53.464
start with the origin and we move 3 units in the x direction for a and 5 units

00:00:53.464 --> 00:00:58.910
in the y direction for b. This hyperbola opens to the left and to the right

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.310
since the x squared term comes first. Whichever term is positive, the x squared

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.110
term or the y squared term. That will determine which way our hyperbola opens.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.213
Since the x squared term here is positive, then we know that it opens left and

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:16.070
right.
