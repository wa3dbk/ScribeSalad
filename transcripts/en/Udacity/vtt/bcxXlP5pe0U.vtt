For this problem, we have to order these six graphs by the clustering coefficient of the red node,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the graphs will be ordered from the lowest clustering coefficient to highest.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Looking at the six graphs, we can see that c is a star network,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and star networks have a clustering coefficient of zero.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That is the lowest clustering coefficient.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You can see that d is a click to the clustering coefficient of one

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
as that will be the highest clustering coefficient.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Both b and f have two edges connecting the neighbors of the red node.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's take a look at those two.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Intuitively, since b has seven neighbors and f has five, b has a larger click and f has a smaller click,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and since they both only have two neighboring edges and b has load larger click,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and actually calculating the clustering coefficient, we can see that yes, b is smaller than f.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
For a, the degree of the red node is five and there are five links between the neighbors,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so we have a clustering coefficient of half and for e degree of the red node is seven,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and they are seven links between these neighbors, so the clustering coefficient is 1/3.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So, the final answer is c, b, f, e, a, d.
