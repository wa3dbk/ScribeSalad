Now, where would you place tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon on this chart? Would it

00:00:04.765 --> 00:00:09.338
go here? Not very awake and not very aware. Would it go here? Really aware but

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:14.211
you're not awake. Would it go here where you're not aware but you are awake? Or

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:18.784
would it go here where you're awake, but not completely aware? Select one that

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:22.432
you think is where the tip-of-the tongue phenomenon would be on this chart of

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:27.348
awareness and wakefulness. So, the more awake you are, you're over here and the

00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:30.036
more aware you are, you're up here.
