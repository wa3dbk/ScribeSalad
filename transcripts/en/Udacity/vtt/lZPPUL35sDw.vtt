00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.580
There are also minimum scale and maximum scale properties too. Which

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.860
is a way to limit the extents, that the system is

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.770
allowed to scale the page on the device. That seems a

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.350
little esoteric at first, but, there is one use that, I

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.400
wanted to mention. I don't want, you to think, that I'm

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.780
biased. So, after describing how you need to add initial scale,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.830
for iOS to work as expected. I wanted to give equal

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.040
time, for, Android. If your page, with device width happens to forcibly,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.850
overflow the page, like this page, where I've added an

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.410
element that's very wide, Android will actually, do some rescaling, when

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.050
you change screen orientation, to, try to get the whole

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.980
page to fit onto the screen. Now, unfortunately, it gets it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.840
wrong, and it tries to zoom it the wrong way.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.590
Now, the only way that I found, to get around this,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.410
other than not overflowing the screen to begin with, is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.480
to set the minimum scale and maximum scale properties, to one,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.990
which will prevent the user from zooming altogether.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.710
As well as, disabling automatic scaling. Let's do

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.120
that in the dev tools now. Now let's

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.800
try rotating again. We're back to normal here, and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.460
now, you see that even in landscape mode, we get the proper width. Now, the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.370
problem with this, of course, is i can't

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.480
zoom anymore. We really don't want to disable zooming,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.590
for, your users; this is an accessibility problem.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.750
So, don't do this in production pages, but,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440
it can help your testing, in, general just

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.400
don't overflow the page and you'll be good.
