00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.757
Now, I think this is a really difficult concept, so fair warning, this might be

00:00:04.757 --> 00:00:08.979
confusing. If you're totally good on this, awesome, move forward. If not, you

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.517
might want to spend a little bit of extra time trying to understand this

00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:16.350
concept. Since we said that we can substitute really whatever we want in the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.370
place of x, I can actually substitute in a different expression that involves an

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.605
x. So here we have a function defined with x as the independent variable. And in

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:30.100
the place of a independent variable I can plug in x squared for example.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.935
Remember that these variables are really just place holders for us to plug in,

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:38.190
other numbers that we know that they can equal. And if we decide that we want to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.364
plug in x squared, we are totally entitled to do that. So, how would you write

00:00:43.364 --> 00:00:48.662
out, in simplest terms, what f of x squared is? And yes, please remember to

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:50.383
simplify as much as you can.
