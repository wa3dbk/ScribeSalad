00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.090
The question is asking you to differentiate

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.780
between pointers in in Modula-3 and pointers

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.750
in C. And the choices I have for you are, there are no differences between

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.370
pointers in a language like Modula-3 and

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.062
C, C pointers are more restricted, or Modula-3

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:21.590
pointers are type-specific. So these are the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.390
three choices. And one right choice. Good luck.
