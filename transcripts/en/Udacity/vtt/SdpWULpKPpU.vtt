A question for you. Where does the displacement of the surface happen. That is,

00:00:04.234 --> 00:00:08.884
which part of the pipeline deforms and shifts the surface itself? Is it the

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:13.760
vertex shader, during rasterization, the fragment shader, or the Z-buffer?

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.520
There's only one part of the pipeline that can do this sort of operation.
