Okay, so in this quiz I'm asking you to identify which type of the 4 types

00:00:05.018 --> 00:00:10.355
of parallelism we've looked at is represented by which of these algorithms that I've written down here.

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:14.184
So, matrix multiplication, which is multiplying 2 matrices together,

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:20.020
finding faces in a photograph album where I might have hundreds of photographs and I'm trying to find faces in all of them,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.003
binary search, finding a number in a list of numbers,

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.197
and calling a parallel library from inside of a kernel.
