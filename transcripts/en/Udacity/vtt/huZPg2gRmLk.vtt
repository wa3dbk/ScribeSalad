00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.020
We can add an axis to our chart simply by calling an axis method and

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.610
the chart object.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.440
Since our x axis represents years, we use the addTimeAxis method and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.120
specify that the x axis should correspond to the year field of our data.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.450
Let's finish this by adding a semicolon, which is not only a good

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.950
JavaScript best practice, but in some cases your code will run into errors if

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.050
you don't include one after every line, and then add an axis to our chart.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.540
Previously, we tried to inspect my chart and it was quite hard to understand

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.910
what all the methods and properties meant, but let's inspect our x axis.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.880
If we look here, its a dimple.axis object, and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.650
it specified the chart it belongs to, the position,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.690
in this case the x axis, and also what fields it corresponds to.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.440
Something to note here,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.349
that the chart property define our axis actually is a reference to

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.680
the chart object we created earlier, rather than just an identifier string.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.570
And we've tried printing out what this chart object is x.chart,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.420
we get the same object as we got when we printed out myChart.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.800
As you can see here, they're both dimple.chart objects and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.700
they both have all of the same properties.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.290
Now this is possible even if two objects aren't identical, but

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.680
if they have the same properties defined.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.320
Going one step farther,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.680
we can actually compare the myChart object with the triple equals to x.chart.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.300
In this case, it says myChart is exactly equal to the axis chart property.
