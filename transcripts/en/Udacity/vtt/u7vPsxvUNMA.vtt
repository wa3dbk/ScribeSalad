00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first option--use dropdowns to limit what the users can actually enter--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
yes, that makes sense.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In fact, when you fill out your date online, I'm sure they usually have dropdowns

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
for month, day, and year because that simplifies things a little bit.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But no matter what we do, we also need to verify what the user enters

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and complain if the data is bad because as we talked about before,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
just because our form limits what the user can actually enter,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a malicious user or somebody goofing around can make a form that posts to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
any URL they want, including our server, and they can put in whatever junk they want,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and they very well could break our server verification.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A lot of forms--a lot of websites out there think just because they use dropdowns

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that they don't have to verify the data on the backend.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So have fun out there playing with that.
