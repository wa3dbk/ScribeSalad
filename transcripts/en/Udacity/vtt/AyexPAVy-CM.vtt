00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.150
Intrusion detection is also a part of
the network defense-in-depth mechanism.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.270
In this lesson, we're going to discuss
the system architecture, algorithms,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.600
deployment strategies,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.100
as well as performance metrics
of intrusion detection systems.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.500
We're also going to discuss attacks
on intrusion detection systems.
