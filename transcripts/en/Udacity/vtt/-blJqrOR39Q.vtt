00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.969
So the MCS tree barrier is, it's also a

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.290
tree barrier. It's a modified tree barrier, and what

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.980
you'll notice, and once again, to make life simple,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.750
I'm showing you an arrangement of the MCS tree

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.766
barrier with with 8 nodes. And it's a 4

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.185
ary arrival tree. So the arrival tree and the

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.410
wake-up tree are different in the MCS algorithm. The

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.230
arrival tree is a 4 ary tree, and I'm showing

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.558
the arrangement for N equal to 8. There are

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:33.640
2 data structures that are associated with every parent, and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.090
and this one data structure is what is called

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.940
have children, and the other data structure is what is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.200
called child not ready. And I'll describe to you

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.350
what each one of these things is. Have children is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.420
a data structure that is associated with every node.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.580
And this data structure is going to have meaning only

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.290
when a node is also a parent. So for example, if you look at this arrangement,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.210
node P0 has 4 children, P1, P2, P3 and P4. And if you look at node P1,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.630
it has 3 children. And so, P5, P6 and P7, has 3 children. And so we have a total

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.730
of 8 processes, so we've got all 8 processes accounted for here. And therefore,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.340
these guys, P2, P3, P4, all the way up to P7, they're not as lucky as P0 and P1.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.950
They don't have children. So P2 through P7, they do not have children.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.330
And therefore, their HaveChild vector is, is, is

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.460
false. So what you see here is a

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.440
HaveChild vector and the HaveChild vector is, is

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.830
true for P0 in all the big positions.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.310
And indicating that it has because it's a 4

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.610
ary tree, it can potentially have up to four children.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.535
And yes, P0 has 4 children. And the have child

00:01:49.535 --> 00:01:52.932
vector is true all the way, whereas, for P1, the

00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:56.250
have child vector is true for the first 3 children

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.252
and false for the fourth because it has only 3

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:03.580
children. And these guys don't have any children. And similarly,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.570
these guys don't have any children. So, the HaveChild vector

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.320
is completely false for P2 through P7. Now what

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.020
about this Child Not Ready data structure? The Child

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.810
Not Ready data structure is a way by which

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.420
each of these processes has a unique spot in

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.450
the parent to signal when they are arriving at

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.685
a barrier. So what I'm showing you here, the

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:29.470
arrows here are showing you the specific spot in

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.570
this data structure, the child not ready data structure

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.850
associated with his parent, for each of the child,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.860
there is a unique spot for this guy to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.530
indicate that they've arrived at the barrier. And similarly,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.970
for this set of children, the parent is P0 and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.730
each child has a unique spot in the parent's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.710
child not ready vector to indicate that they've arrived

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.090
at the barrier. So the black arrows in this

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.050
structure that I'm showing you is just showing the arrangement

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.740
of the tree. And in terms of the,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.560
the parent child relationship for the 4-ary arrival

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.250
tree. And the red arrows are the ones

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.330
that are showing you the specific spot where

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.060
a particular child is going to indicate to the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.570
parent that they have arrived at the barrier.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.020
And as you can see that since P1

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.250
has 3children, the fourth spot is empty indicating it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.210
has to wait only on 3 children to know

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.530
that the value is completed on the tree and so

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.280
it can move up. So, the algorithm for barrier arrival

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.800
is going to work like this. When each of these processors

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.510
arrive at a barrier, what they going to do is

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.470
they going to reach into the parent data structure, very specific

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.450
spots, statically determined. That's important,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.150
right? So it's statically determined

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.630
that this is a spot that P5 is going to indicate

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.410
to the parent that it has arrived. This

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.610
is the spot that P6 is going to indicate that

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.280
it has arrived. P7, and similarly, once all these

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.580
guys have arrived at the barrier, P1 can check,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.610
and the way P1 checks is, just sees whether

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.000
this CN vector has ones in all these pods.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.760
If there is ones in all these pods, it

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.930
can spin on this, and therefore, it knows that

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.860
its children have arrived at the barrier. Once

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.589
its children have arrived at the barrier, then it

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.769
can move up the tree similar to what we

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.820
saw in the vanilla tree barrier before. P1 is

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.060
going to move up, and it's going to inform its parent.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.720
And the way it does is by going to

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.434
a specific spot in the parent's child not ready

00:04:34.434 --> 00:04:37.900
vector. And there is specific spot assigned for P1.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.690
It's going to set this to indicate that it has arrived

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.040
at the barrier. So what P0 is doing is waiting on

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.650
everybody arrive. If P0 is the first let's say to arrive

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.660
at the barrier. It's basically waiting on everybody else to arrive

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.250
at the barrier. Could be P0 is the first one or

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.990
the last one, it doesn't really matter. When P0 arrives at

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.900
the barrier, it is going to wait on this child not

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.700
ready all the bits being set by the children. And so,

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.400
when each of these nodes arrive at a barrier, they

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.700
know because of the arrangement of this data structure, they know

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.730
their position in the data structure relative to other processes arriving

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.850
at the barrier. And therefore P2, when it arrives at a

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.670
barrier, It knows that all it has to do, given

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.650
the structure, it has to go to this part on the

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.770
parent vector and set it to 1. P3 has to go

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.600
to this part set it to 1 and so on, okay?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.130
And so once it is done, P0 will know

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.360
that everybody has arrived at the barrier. So, that's the

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.780
arrival at the barrier. So once again, the recap. The

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.920
arrival tree is a 4-ary tree. And the reason why

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.530
they chose to use a 4 ary tree is because

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.080
there is a periodic result backing the use of 4

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.610
ary tree leading to the best performance, and that's the

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.170
reason that they, they chose this particular arrangement. And the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.670
second thing that I want you to notice is that

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.510
each processor is assigned to a unique spot by construction,

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.540
a unique spot in this 4 ary tree. And because

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.560
of its unique spot, a particular process on may have children,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.730
or may not have children and in this case, I

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.080
showed you that P0 and P1 are have children, and

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.660
the rest are not as lucky, because N is equal

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.430
to 8. The other nice thing about this particular arrangement is

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.050
that in a cash coherent multiprocessor, it

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.460
is possible to arrange so that all the

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.730
specific spots that children have to signal the

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.470
parent can be packed into one word of

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.940
a processor and therefore, a parent has to

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.470
simply spend on one memory location in order

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.570
to know the arrival of everybody, so it

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.890
doesn't have to individually spend on memory locations

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.140
for different processes, they can all be packed

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.000
into one word, and the cash coherence mechanism

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.890
will ensure that P0 is alerted every time

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.440
any of these guys modify this shared memory location.
