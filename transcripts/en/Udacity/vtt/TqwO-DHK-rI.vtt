00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the example, we're just talking about with the marvel comic book characters,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the strength of the link between some character i and some character j

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
was the number of comic books they appeared in together.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now, this is an actually very useful metric for real life social networks.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I have not appeared in any comic books with anyone.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I have one friend who actually has appeared in a comic book,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
research her by the name of Micheal Bowling at the University of Alberta,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
actually had a comic book character made about himself, which is pretty awesome.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But I didn't appear in that comic book with him, so that's not a very good metric.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We won't really need to be studying weighted social networks just for comic book characters,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but there's lots of natural measures of the strength of a connection

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
between a person i and a person j.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You could imagine saying they're more stronger connected

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
as a function of how often they email each other,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or maybe how many years they have known each other,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the frequency at which they meet in a given week,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
how often they rate each others post on some kind of social networking site,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or maybe the number of news articles both have read

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and you can imagine ask more examples like this.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This notion of having a weight in a social networking is actually a pretty

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
important and relevant concept.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We had talked about shortest paths in a graph,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but now let's extend this notion to the shortest weighted path in our graph.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Here, in this example now, we're going to look at a high weight meaning a weak connection

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and a low weight meaning a strong connection.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can think of the weights as almost as being a kind of cost

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and we're looking for basically cheap roots from one person and a network to another.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The example of this sort of thing might be that we want to

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
send a message from one person to another in a social network

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
minimizing, say a social awkwardness.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
For example, my son is really interested in American history

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and my Dean is an expert in American history,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and he wanted to ask the Dean a question, but that's kind of awkward.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They actually don't know each other directly.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
They accept that they do know each other directly at see.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Random young man don't generally contact Deans of big school of arts and sciences.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
There's a sort of a high social awkwardness for that,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but I was able to help get a message for my son to the Dean

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because I have very low social awkwardness with my son

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and I have fairly low social awkwardness with the Dean.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The path of sending a message basically recommendation

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
for a book to read about American history, traveled much more easily through me to the Dean

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
than it would have to the Dean directly, and I should note that my son also has curly hair.
