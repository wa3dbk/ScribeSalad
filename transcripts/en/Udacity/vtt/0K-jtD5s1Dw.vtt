00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.497
I think this should be called vertex form since, as we've seen, we can just read

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:08.927
off the coordinates of the vertex, which is at h,k. That's why this form is so

00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:13.412
useful, and also because we can see from the coefficient of a about how wide the

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:17.469
graph is going to be. Now, there may be some variation depending on what source

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:21.373
you look at for what we should call this equation, but for the purposes of this

00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:25.404
class, we're going to call this the vertex form for the equation of a parabola.

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:29.229
You may see other names elsewhere and there's not one that's absolutely right or

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.048
absolutely wrong, but for the sake of speaking the same language, know that this

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:35.186
is what I mean when I talk about vertex form.
