All Android apps must be digitally
signed before they can be installed on

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.130
a device.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.119
The actual cryptography in math
of how the signing process works

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.290
is utterly fascinating, but also kind
of beyond the scope of this course.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.970
Digitally signing an app
accomplishes two things.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.540
First, it allows Google and
users who download the app to

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.690
verify the identity of
the developer that published it.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.600
Second, it guarantees that the app
hasn't been tampered with since

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.840
it was signed.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.210
Quite simply, signing is required for
apps on the Play Store, so

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.720
that users can be sure that the app they
are downloading was indeed published by

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.100
the listed developer.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.080
It also protects you,
as the developer, so

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.690
that no one else can publish
an app under your name.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.410
Gradle automatically
signs debug applications

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.230
with a special debug key that allows our
app to installed on development devices.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.310
However, app sign with a debug key can't
be published through the Play Store.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.090
In order to sign an app,
we first need to generate a key.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.890
This key will be unique to you and
should be used to sign all of your apps.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.080
We will also create a key store which
is just a special type of database

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.480
that we keep our key in.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.370
Android Studio makes creating key stores
and generating keys incredibly simple.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.560
Let's take a look at how this is done.
