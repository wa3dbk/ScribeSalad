00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.019
So, given this pipeline that was in the quiz, we found that B is the slow stage

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.877
here and B is, in fact, called the bottleneck. It's the slowest stage and it's

00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:11.628
the one that determines how fast anything is going to come out of the pipeline.

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:15.321
And there's always a bottleneck in the pipeline. In fact, there's always some

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:19.149
slowest stage. Maybe two or three that are tied for slowest but there's always

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:24.207
some stage that's the slowest. Objects 3 and 4 move on through the pipeline and

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:29.044
object 2 is still being processed by B. So, what this is called is when stage C

00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:33.332
is waiting for input and nothing's coming because we're waiting for B to finish,

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:37.790
that's called starvation. That's where C is not getting anything until B is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.105
totally complete. On the other hand, what's happening here is stage A has

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:46.383
finished processing object 1 but object 1 can't move on because, stage B is

00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:51.200
still processing object 2. This is called stalling. With the rendering pipeline,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.989
these same sorts of principles apply. Having the application run efficiently and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.695
keep the GPU fed with data is a common bottleneck for example. The bottleneck

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:02.250
will change over time. With sometimes one stage being the slowest sometimes

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.570
another. Gpu designers use different techniques to perform load balancing, such

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.604
as first in and first out queues. Where you sort of stack up a bunch of objects

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:14.636
so that if the stage suddenly gets faster, a bunch of objects can move into it

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:19.252
quickly, or other techniques such as unified shaders. We wont be describing

00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:22.969
these techniques in detail in this course, but it's good to be aware that the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.684
GPU has a lot going on inside of it. Various performance debugging tools let you

00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:30.129
see what parts of the pipeline are bottlenecks and so, can help you improve the

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:31.693
performance of your application.
