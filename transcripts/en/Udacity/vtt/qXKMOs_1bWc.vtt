00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.480
Programmers often take many
responsibilities within a team.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.710
Sometimes programmers wear many hats and

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.640
are able to branch out
of their specific roles.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.370
And other times they work
with other programmers

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.715
with more specialized skills.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.570
Front-end programmers have
a unique role on teams.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.710
They connect with other programmers
to collaborate on projects.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.244
Remember, every team and
company will function differently.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.025
Generally, front-end programmers link
with UX UI designers to translate design

00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:34.610
mock-ups into full functioning websites
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.480
They also connect with
back-end developers

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.825
to think through how client data
will be stored, used and displayed.

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:45.785
They also may interact with product
managers about the overall vision and

00:00:45.785 --> 00:00:47.295
requirements for the final product.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.055
Front-end programmers are just one piece
of the puzzle when it comes to creating

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:53.675
web application.

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:56.555
In the next lesson,
we'll learn about back-end programmers.
