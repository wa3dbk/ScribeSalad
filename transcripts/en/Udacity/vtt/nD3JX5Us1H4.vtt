00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.648
Let's look at each of these materials in turn. The problem with the highly

00:00:03.648 --> 00:00:07.938
reflective ball, is that you're picking up light that's reflected off of this

00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:11.244
surface. So, you're not just looking at the surface, and seeing how the light

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:14.752
affects it, you're seeing how other surfaces affect it. So, this answer is no

00:00:14.752 --> 00:00:18.150
good. This one works just fine. This wooden ball isn't really doing anything as

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.833
for reflecting other objects, it's just getting directly illuminated. So,

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:25.996
that answer is correct. Light bulb, oddly enough, is something that you can just

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:29.950
render very simply, there's not really much to it. You basically are looking at

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.783
the surface and the filament inside the light is Illuminating it. So, this

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:38.010
answer is also correct. Finally, this glass ball is no good because it's picking

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.873
up light contributions from other objects in the scene.
