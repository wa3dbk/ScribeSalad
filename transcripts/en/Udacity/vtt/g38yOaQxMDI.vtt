00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.740
Alright. Let's have something more concrete to work

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.230
on. If you've organized events, you've probably used sites

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.530
like [UNKNOWN] or eventbrite.com. Well, let's say you wanted

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.670
to create an app to organize conferences. That type

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.720
of application would need to support at least the

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.790
following. A user can register, a user can create

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.660
conferences. Users can attend conferences. And of course, it

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.720
needs to be accessible both from the browser and

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.425
the mobile device. Well, we're going to create such an

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:31.480
application. And it's going to be called Conference Central. And

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.800
you're tasked to build it. And since it needs

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.550
to support multiple backends, you will use Cloud Endpoints to

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.100
create this application. Let's get started with Conference Central,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.130
by having you download the skeleton code. Now, let's

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.600
take a quick tour of the completed Conference Central

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.700
application that you will build. But before we do that,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.710
let's do a quick demo of the finished application. As

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.330
you can see, you're presented with a very nice landing

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.200
page for Conference Central. And if we scroll down, you

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.730
can see options to view conferences. Create conferences and update your

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.990
profile. But, before that, let's sign into the application. Sign

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.910
in, we'll use Google Plus sign in. Once we are signed

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.230
into the application, we can start to explore the functionality.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.970
I can, for example, go to my profile where my personal

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.640
information is stored. I can also show the registered

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.870
conferences. So here you can see the name of the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.090
conference. The city where it will be in. The

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.950
start date, organizer, how many people are registered to conference.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.650
And how many tickets are available to the conference.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.970
You can also query for different conferences. For example, the

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.100
ones you've created. Or the ones that you will

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.120
attend. You can also query by other types of properties.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.650
And you can view the details for a conference. You can also of

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.329
course, create new conferences. Well that's an

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.030
overview of Conference Central. The application that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.660
you will build and run in the Google Cloud. Now it's time for

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.290
you to do some work and get you started building Conference Central. Good luck.
