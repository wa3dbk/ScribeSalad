00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.044
Remember that our degrees of freedom will be the sum of the two sample sizes, 6

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:09.528
plus 5, and then minus 2, because we subtract for this sample and one for this

00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:17.642
sample. We get our degrees of freedom is 9. Now, when we look at the t table,

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:23.285
we see that our t critical value should be positive or negative 2.262.
