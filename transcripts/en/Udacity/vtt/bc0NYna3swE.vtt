00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.660
Let me show you three different types of kernels that are used

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.960
in doing various types of of H detection.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.510
The Prewitt, the Sobel, and the Roberts.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.650
The Prewitt kernel basically uses negative values in this and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.460
positive values, and of course a transpose.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.450
The Sobel gives it a little bit more heavier thing to the middle kernel.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.720
Our middle values.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.750
Remember we looked at trying to look at points where sometimes just giving it

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.530
a ramp in the middle gives a little bit more information locally.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.710
Transpose of this is, of course, here.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.190
The Roberts one is even simpler,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.110
except it actually basically puts in values at the two different end diagonals.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.400
And uses that to compute radiance.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.050
Let's try this on our input image.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.780
I'm just showing you the response for the derivative in x.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.250
You can extrapolate and see what it would look like in y.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.550
You notice that, of course,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.700
it does actually a pretty good job in trying to compute the gradients.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.030
Or the gradient in x, in this instance.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm aware that the, perhaps at resolution, you can't see the details.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But hopefully, you'll trust me.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.390
And we'll try to make some of these available to you.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.920
Of course, we're interested in computing edges.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.970
So from this set of input images in Hx,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.210
let's see what we can what edges would look like.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.060
I have yet to explain how we're going to go to edge from here.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.530
But I just wanted to show you examples right now.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.720
This is basically doing edge detection from the original image

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.300
using the Prewitt, the Sabel operator, and the Roberts one.
