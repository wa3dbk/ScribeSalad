00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:07.387
Well, 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 is 10. And 10 divided by 4 is 2.5. So the mean is

00:00:07.387 --> 00:00:13.028
2.5, represented by Mu. This is called the expected value. Even though we don't

00:00:13.028 --> 00:00:18.832
really expect to get 2.5, because it's not even an option. But since that's the

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:23.392
mean of our population, we expect to get somewhere around 2.5 if we take a

00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:25.350
sample from this population.
