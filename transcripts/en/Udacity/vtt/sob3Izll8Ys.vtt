00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.541
Interestingly enough, we get 25. We know that when we multiply a real number by

00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:08.921
a real number, we get a real number. And we've seen before that if we multiply

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:13.477
two imaginary numbers together, since we're multiplying something with an i to

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:17.825
something else with an i, we end up with a real number for that term as well. In

00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:22.113
this case, we don't get an imaginary component for this final number because the

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:26.687
middle terms cancel one another out. We have minus 12i and plus 12i. We can

00:00:26.687 --> 00:00:30.911
notice that the only difference between these two terms and the reason we get

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:34.490
this answer is the sign of b. Keep this in mind as we move forward.
