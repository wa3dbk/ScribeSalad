00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
So if you fast forward a few years, there're been a lot of new ideas

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.004
that have come into CUDA between the time you launched 5 or 6 years ago and today.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:12.421
So what are maybe the 2 or 3 coolest ideas that you think have come in since the time you launched?

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:15.994
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well certainly we've added a lot of support for managing concurrency.

00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:20.246
There's no shortage of parallelism in these codes if people want to move to the GPU.

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:25.578
So we've added better support for concurrency, for streams.

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:29.325
We've even moved some of that from what started out in software support--

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:33.372
actually is now baked into the hardware with the Kepler and the hyper queue.

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:37.329
Those are pieces of silk and they're actually inspired by

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.658
some of the stuff we were doing in software, originally with CUDA 2.0.

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:43.964
Other stuff we've been doing is integrating closer with the memory hierarchy.

00:00:43.964 --> 00:00:47.827
In CUDA 4.0 we did the UVA work, which is unifying the virtual address base

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:51.744
of the entire machine such that--this was work we did

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:54.418
so tightly integrating with the operating system

00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:57.452
such that a bi-pointer value,

00:00:57.452 --> 00:01:01.246
the system can know if memory is living on the CPU or living on the GPU.

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:03.698
So there's no separate memory spaces anymore.

00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:06.743
You can simply dereference a pointer, it goes to the right machine--

00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:09.913
a right CPU or GPU or your peer's GPU.

00:01:09.913 --> 00:01:12.871
That made multi-GPU programming way easier

00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:15.664
than we had before CUDA 4.0.

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:18.293
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I mean as a professor, I think usually what I say is

00:01:18.293 --> 00:01:22.786
the most common error is accessing memory on the wrong side of the machine. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:26.245
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You think you're dereferencing a GPU pointer, and it's really on the CPU.

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:30.000
That's certainly very helpful in going out and doing those.
