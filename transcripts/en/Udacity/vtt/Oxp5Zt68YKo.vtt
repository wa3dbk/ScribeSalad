00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.488
Well we know that the formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:08.500
or a box like this, is just to multiply the length, the width, and height

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.580
together. So all we need to do is plug in the values that we know for each of

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.099
those quantities. So we'll have 10 centimeters times 8 centimeters times 5

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.897
centimeters, and that gives us a final answer of 400 centimeters cubed. Or, in

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:24.321
other words, 400 cubic centimeters.
