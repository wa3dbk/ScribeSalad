00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
So the Roadblock problem is know to be exponential-time complete,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.150
which means it's provably harder than any problem in NP

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.650
even on a nondeterministic machine.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.980
And the proof does not depend on whether P=NP or not.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.870
The proof is certain; Roadblock is harder than any problem in NP.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.180
So it's harder than, say, vertex cover.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.290
Now why is that? Why can't nondeterminism help us to solve Roadblock?

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.070
Well, it can help us, but it apparently can't help us enough

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.610
to make this problem solvable in NP.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.070
So there's several ways to explain this, and 1 of the differences

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.760
between NP and problems that are harder than NP is that in NP,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
or, more concretely, in a problem like vertex cover, you're dealing with a static input.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.680
You're given 1 graph, and for that graph you're trying to solve 1 question.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.390
And that question is: Do you have a vertex cover of a certain size?

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.550
Asking for an optimal strategy in a game like Roadblock is a bit different

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.400
because this game is played against a player.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.440
So the question kind of is: After player 1 has made a move, what can player 2 do?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.210
And player 2, of course, has a number of possible reactions to what player 1 has done.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.470
You need to take all of these possibilities into consideration.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.060
How player 1 makes the second move or the third move

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
always depends on what player 2 is doing in between.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.790
And that is why this problem here is intuitively exponential-time complete,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.860
because after every move that player 1 makes,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.150
you have to consider all of the possibilities that player 2 makes.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.280
And there's no way around that, instead of here,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.310
where we can just guess a small vertex cover.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.300
There's a description for this that is a little bit more formal.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.800
You can say that NP is kind of the set of problems that have a short proof.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.080
And by short, I mean a polynomial-time verifiable proof.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.880
So, for example, for vertex cover, when I tell you

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.030
I have a vertex cover that only uses 5 vertices,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.890
and you ask me, please show me that vertex cover,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
well, I can just specify those 5 vertices to you,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.920
and you can check yourself that they will make up a vertex cover for the input graph.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.160
Now, for a game like Roadblock, that is not that easy,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.039
because if you said, "Player 1 can always win this game,"

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.040
and I asked you--I wanted proof of that, then we again get into

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.110
this situation that the proof of the optimal strategy is exponential in size.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.510
Because that proof will basically start out by saying,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.270
okay, this is the first move that player 1 should make,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.340
but then there are a couple of reactions that player 2 could have to that move.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.130
So, let's say it branches out; so this is what player 1 is doing,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.130
and this is what player 2 is doing.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.530
Now, for each of these reactions of player 2, I will again in this proof

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.410
have to specify what player 1 is supposed to do.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.310
But then, as you see, it branches out. Player 2 again has a number

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.690
of possible reactions that it can have to this move.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.580
For Roadblock, if you think of this as a large search tree,

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.480
it doesn't suffice to show that there's just 1 single path that leads to a solution,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.610
but basically  you have to show that any path here in this tree

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.870
always leads to player 1 winning.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.090
So for vertex cover or any other problem in NP

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.400
and, of course, this is again talking very informally,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.940
it suffices to show 1 path in the search tree.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.480
Whereas for a problem like Roadblock, the proof that, for example,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.120
player 1 can always win, would require you to show the whole search tree

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.450
and not just a single path, and that is why problems such as Roadblock

00:03:23.450 --> 99:59:59.000
are provably harder than problems in NP.
