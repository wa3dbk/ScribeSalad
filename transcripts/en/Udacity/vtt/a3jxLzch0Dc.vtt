00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.090
So far,

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.320
we've been focusing on the technology
aspects of information security.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.390
However, the organization
note as assigned to aspects

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.910
are also very important.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.650
In the next few lectures Dr.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.190
Mustaque Ahamad is going to
cover several of these topics.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.150
&gt;&gt; We're going to start with managing
cyber security in the context of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.590
an organization.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.400
So what is it cyber risk?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.360
How can it reduce that risk with using
technical solutions that we discussed,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.510
and what are the cost benefit
trade offs for example?

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.360
Once we do that, we're going to move
on to how can we have consequences for

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.590
the bad guys.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.690
Well laws, or cyber laws in particular,
are one way to do that.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.540
So we'll discuss some of
the US cyber laws and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.700
then also some ethical considerations.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
Then we're going to wrap up with online
privacy which is a topic that is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.120
of great deal of interest to many of us.
