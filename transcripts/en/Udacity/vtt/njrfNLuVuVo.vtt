00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.075
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In order to satisfy this equation, we need to either have x equals 0 or need

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:10.521
to have 3x plus 2 equals 0. X has conveniently already been solved for here, and

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:16.088
this equation gives us a solution x equals negative 2/3. So x can either take on

00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:21.340
a value of 0 or it can take on a value of negative 2/3 to make this equation

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.302
right here true. The x-coordinates of the points where this parabola crosses the

00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:29.555
x-axis are 0 and negative 2/3.
