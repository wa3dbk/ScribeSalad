00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.300
There are many services out

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.520
there that let you create
clusters on demand in minutes.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.210
This allows you to pay for a cluster
only when you need the resources.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.950
Amazon's offering is called
Elastic MapReduce, or EMR for short.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.465
It works well with other
AWS services such as S3 and

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:21.721
automatically installed applications
such as Hive, Presto, and Spark.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.441
Google has a service too.

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:27.040
Cloud Data Proc allows you to analyze
data with MapReduce, Hive, Spark,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.844
and others.

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:31.677
Microsoft also has a Hadoop
cloud service, HDInsight.

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.330
Which one you choose
depends on your budget and

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.742
how well it works with other
cloud services you're using.

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:40.400
For this lesson you'll
be using Amazon's EMR.
