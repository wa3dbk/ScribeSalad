00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well that time we got it right but suppose we made a mistake.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Suppose we had access to the global environment

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so this is actually defined,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and instead of passing in the current environment,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
whenever we make a function, we're going to pass in the global environment instead.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is a bug. This is not correct.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's try to reason forward about what might go wrong,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and how we could see this bug or how it would behave.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm going to write some statements and you're going to tell me which ones are true.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here I've written four claims, and in this multiple choice test

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'd like you to note which ones are true.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The first, no test input with only one function can show the bug.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The second, we need at least three variables

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in the global environment to see the bug.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Here--see the bug, show the bug, expose the bug--all mean the same thing.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We can show the bug with only two functions,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
each of which is separately declared at the top level,

00:00:51.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and finally, we can show the bug with one function nested inside another function.
