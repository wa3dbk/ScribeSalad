00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.950
Let's briefly talk about magnetic tape, which is usually

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.150
used for backup purposes or so-called secondary storage, which

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.925
means that the magnetic tape is not the first

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:14.400
device on which you look for your data. You first

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.200
try to find your data on the hard drive. And only if it's not there, you go to

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.650
secondary storage. Either because the hard drive was lost

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.230
and you need to restore and back-up or because this

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.920
data was not used for a long, long time, so it was stored on tapes and put away

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.630
somewhere. Tapes can have large capacity and are usually

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.958
replaceable. Meaning you just bring a reel of tape and

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.164
you attach to the tape machine. But their access

00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:43.735
is fundamentally sequential. We need to seek along the tape

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:47.380
until we find the point we are interested in.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.356
So tapes are very good for things like back-up restoring

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:53.580
back-ups and so on when you're writing things sequentially

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.060
for a long time or reading them sequentially for

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.942
a long time. But tapes are not very good,

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:03.020
for example, as a virtual memory or something like that.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.125
Tapes are slowly dying out, mainly because they have

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:09.368
a low production volume because not many people actually use

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:12.258
tape. So the cost of tapes is not dropping

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:15.618
as rapidly as the cost of disks, which have much

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:19.482
more mass production, so their cost gets cheaper over

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:22.473
time. And at this point, it's cheaper to buy

00:01:22.473 --> 00:01:25.507
an entire hard drive together with all the motors

00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:28.837
and the head assembly and a built-in electronics for

00:01:28.837 --> 00:01:31.353
it, than to buy some tape and the machine

00:01:31.353 --> 00:01:34.379
that will read it. So people for example, use

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:37.343
USB drives which is pretty much an entire hard

00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:40.775
disk just packaged with a USB interface, as a method

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:42.770
of backup storage and so on.
