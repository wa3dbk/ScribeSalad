00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.110
If you picked any or more or all of

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.070
the choices that I gave you, you're not completely

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.300
off base. Let me just talk through each of

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.150
these choices and why it may be a perfectly

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.010
valid choice for the scheduler in picking the next

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.282
thread to run on the processor. First come first

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:22.140
search says well, you know there is an, an

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.630
order of arrival into the processor, there's a fairness issue,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.140
I'm going to pick the one that became runnable at the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.432
earliest, so there is a first come first serve policy, [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:35.150
in that. The second is, well somebody paid a lot

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.060
of money to run the program, and so I'm going to give

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.190
it a priority that it statically assigned with every process

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.420
or thread. And I'm going to pick the one that has the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.470
highest priority, so that's also a valid choice. The third possibility

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.930
is, a thread's priority is not static. It may be born

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.870
with a certain priority, but over time, it

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.770
might change. Why might it, might the thread's priority

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.490
change over time? Well, for one thing, operating systems

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.550
typically tend to give priority to jobs or processes,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.310
or threads what do we even want to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.170
call them that tend to be interactive. That tend

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.980
to take a short amount of time on the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.780
CPU and then go off and IO or synchronization.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.250
Those kinds of threads are shortest amount of time that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.860
it takes on the processor, the schedule may want to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.770
boost up the priority of the process and give it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.860
a higher priority, even if it was born with a

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.840
smaller static priority. And that maybe a reason why it

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.550
might choose a higher dynamic priority. That's a third choice.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.230
And the fourth choice is pick the one whose memory

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.770
contents in the CPU cache is likely to be the highest.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.800
What that means is the that thread that has

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.500
the cache warn for its working set is likely

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.690
to do really well when it gets scheduled on

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.500
a processor. And so it makes sense to suggest that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.030
this might be a good choice as well. So,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.460
all of these four choices, one can't argue for

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.790
and, for and against. But in this particular lecture,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.130
what we're going to think about is particularly look at this

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.900
last choice and that is picking the thread whose memory

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.369
contents are likely to be in the CPU cache. Picking

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.781
that as a choice, why that makes a lot sense

00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:21.337
especially in a multiprocessor, where there's going to be several levels

00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:24.151
of caches and, and cohesivenesses and so on and so

00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:28.050
forth. We'll discuss more about that in the rest of

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.120
this lecture, but I wanted to warm you up with

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.940
this particular quiz In which we have all these different choices.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.630
And one can, as I said, argue for or against

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.380
every one of these choices, and there are valid arguments

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.995
both for and against. But, this is the choice that

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:45.090
we're going to focus on for the rest of this lecture.
