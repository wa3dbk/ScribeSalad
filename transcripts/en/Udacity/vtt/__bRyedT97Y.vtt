Now let's see how object oriented analysis might work

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.640
in practice by considering the following requirement for an online

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.230
shopping website. The requirement says that users can add

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.890
more than one item on sale at a time to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.590
a shopping cart. So, looking at this requirement I

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.180
would like you to tell me which of the following

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.285
elements should be modeled as classes. And the elements

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:25.650
are: item, sale, shopping cart, time and user. So mark

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.370
all that apply.
