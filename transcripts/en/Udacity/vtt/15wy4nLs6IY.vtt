00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.060
The trickiest part of this
problem is setting it up.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.510
We need to figure out the correct
placement of the values

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.600
on the left-hand side on
the butterfly network.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.610
Even though as we go forward here,
omega is going to be negative

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.345
i instead of i because we're
doing the inverse transform.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:21.850
We need to order the values according

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.846
to the omega that was used
in the forward transform.

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:34.490
So thus, omega to the 1 is i, and omega
to the third power is negative i here.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.820
Carrying the calculation forward
a level we obtain these results here.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.370
Then for this last level we have
4 plus 8 which is 12, good.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.730
Then for this next one we want
omega to the first power times

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.450
this and because we're doing the inverse
transform that omega is negative i.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.170
And that gives us this result here of 4.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.890
For the next one,
we multiply the odd term by negative 1.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.420
So that gives us negative 4 here.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.530
And for the last one we multiply
by our omega cubed which is i.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.218
We multiply that by the odd term, and

00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:16.890
combining that with this
gives us a total of 8.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.110
To get the original polynomial,
we divide by n, 4 in this case.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.870
Thus we have that the original
polynomial was 3 plus x

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.360
minus x squared plus two X cubed.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.280
And you can check that
that all works out.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.710
Note that there is a sense in which
the ordering over here was arbitrary.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.220
We could have done the forward
transform with omega equal to -i,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.172
in which case I would've
flipped these and

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:49.525
then the inverse transform
would've used i here and -i here.

00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:52.690
And that would have given
us the same result.
