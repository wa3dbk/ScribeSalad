Say you tilt the view a little and set the linear filter. As you increase the

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.450
resolution of the texture, the checker edges get less and less blurry. At some

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.857
point, the edges become sharp. If you now use the mousewheel to move in towards

00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:16.097
the texture, at a certain distance the edges suddenly become smooth again. This

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:19.880
may not show up on the video, and the texture size it happens for you may vary.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.370
But you should see the edges suddenly get sharp and then smooth. Go back to the

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.530
demo and try it yourself.
