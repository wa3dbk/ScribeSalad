00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.110
The Hopcroft-Karp
algorithm goes like this.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.260
We first initialize the matching to the
empty set, then we repeat the following.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.658
First, we build an alternating
level graph rooted at the unmatched

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:17.460
vertices on the left part of the
partition using breadth-first search.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.340
Let's pause for a moment here and
see how this works in an example.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.220
The first iteration is trivial, so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.290
let's start with a later iteration
where we have some existing matching

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.840
marked by the orange edges here
that we're trying to augment.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.300
Level 0 consists of the unmatched
vertices on the left side and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.640
to go to the next level,
we follow the unmatched edges.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.420
Then we follow matched edges to
get back to the left hand side.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.680
And then we follow along unmatched
vertices which lead us to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.020
an unmatched vertex on
the right hand side.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.190
So that's a level we can stop at.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.390
And we end up with this here for
our total level graph.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.160
Having built this level graph, we use
it to augment the current matching

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200
with a maximal set of vertex
disjoint shortest augmenting paths.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.920
We accomplish this by starting at one
of the unmatched vertices in R and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.620
tracing our way back.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.540
Let's say that I used this path here.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.610
Well then because I'm looking for

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.920
a set of vertex disjoint paths, I can
go ahead and delete these vertices.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.090
And with these vertices deleted,
I can also go and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.370
delete all the other vertices
that got orphaned in the process.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.650
And at this point we note that I had
to delete the other unmatched vertex,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.740
nr, and
that tells me that I found a maximal

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.390
set of vertex disjoint
shortest-length paths.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.740
Once we've applied all these
augmenting paths, we go back and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.990
rebuild the level graph, and keeping
doing this until no more augmenting

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.524
paths exist, and then we can
return the matching that we found.

00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:57.890
&gt;From the description, it's clear
that each iteration of this loop,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.840
what we'll call a phase from now
on takes on the order E time,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.119
building a level graph is
done by breadth first search.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.479
And so that only takes order E time and
the second part

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.850
can also be thought of as a single
traversal of the graph essentially.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.490
As we're picking a path from one
of the unmatched vertices in R

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.300
to one of the unmatched in L
we can follow any edge here.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.900
We don't have to be careful at all,
because in effect,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.160
all roads lead to
an unmatched vertex in L.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.440
The key insight is that only about
the square root of V phases are needed

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.830
in order for us to get to a point where
there are no more augmenting paths.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.550
Overall then,
we seek to prove the theorem stating

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.250
that given a bipartite graph,
the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.590
finds a maximum matching in time
order E times the square root of V.
