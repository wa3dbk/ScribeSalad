00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now coming back to this picture here,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
you see what I meant when I said that hardness of a problem

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
can be measured as both a function of

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the size of the imput and the structure of the imput,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so in the case of the vertex covered, it turns out that

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what makes solving vertex cover hard

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is actually the size of the vertex cover itself.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So if there's a small vertex cover, then the problem is easy

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and if it's large, then the problem becomes hard.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now of course, this immediately raises a question for

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the book of the laws of NP-completeness

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and that question is, is every problem fixed-parameter tractable?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That depends, it depends on what you consider as a parameter,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and one parameter I will soon introduce to you as well

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is a parameter called distance from triviality,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but unfortunately in general, not every NP-complete problem

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
seems to be fixed-parameter tractable.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So for vertex cover, we have just shown

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that if you use the size of the solution as a parameter,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
then yes, this problem is fix-parameter tractable

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
using K, and by K I mean the size of the solution of course.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now what about clique and independent set?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And again, we can consider these 2

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
problems together because they're so similar.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And here unfortunately, I have a bit of bad news for you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
because using K, by which I mean the size of the solution,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that's highly unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So by highly unlikely, what I mean is it would not

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
be something as similar as P=NP or something like that,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but still there is evidence in a way that is similar to P versus NP

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that clique and independent set are not fixed-parameter tractable

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
at least if you consider the parameter to be the size of an optimal solution.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now what about shortest tour?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Well, one possible parameter here would be using D,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the size of a shortest tour,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and here again, it seems somewhat unlikely

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but for shortest tour, another parameter has been investigated

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that actually seems rather promising,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and that parameter is called using distance from triviality,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and there it turns out shortest tour actually could be fixed-parameter tractable.

00:01:54.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now what is distance from triviality?
