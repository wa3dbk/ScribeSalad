00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.900
&gt;&gt; There are a couple of other points to note about this exercise.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.490
An important question in our [INAUDIBLE] is, what knowledge does one need.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.100
It's not a question of putting in a lot of knowledge into a program.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.480
Instead, the real question is, in order to accomplish a goal what is

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.280
the minimal amount of knowledge that the AI agent actually needs?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.720
Let's see how this applies here. The goal was to show that the object is a mug.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.034
Instead of putting in a lot of knowledge, the agent starts asking,

00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:05.720
what do we need in order to show that the object can protect against heat?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.270
What do we need to know to show that the object is stable?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.350
And then it goes about searching for that knowledge. The second point to

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.590
note here is, depending on the background knowledge available, the agent will

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.500
opportunistically build the right kind of causal proofs. So if the agent knows

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.170
about the wooden spoon, it will approve this proof. If, on the other hand,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.950
the AI agent knew not about the wooden spoon but about the oven mitt,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.920
then it could use this particular proof. Which proof the AI agent will build,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.390
will depend upon the precise background knowledge available to it
