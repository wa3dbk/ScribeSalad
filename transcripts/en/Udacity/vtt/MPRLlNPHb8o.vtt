After you have prepared your game for
display in an app store, you should

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.060
decide whether you want your app to be
available locally or internationally.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.480
If you do want to go international,
you'll definitely want to localize.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.600
Localization means changing
pieces of your game so

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.470
that they fit in the language and
culture of different locations.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.520
This can include changing the currency
or the language of any game text.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.970
This can help encourage people around
the world to download your game.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.920
Let's see how you can include
translation in the code of your game.
