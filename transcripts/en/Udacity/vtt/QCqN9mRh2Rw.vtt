00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.060
There are a couple of ways
of doing a 3D sensing

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.490
some of which we've already seen.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.390
So Passive 3D sensing,
what do we mean by that?

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.540
That means you don't use
any active illumination,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.730
that is you take the world as it's given
to you and you somehow sense that.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.400
And maybe you exploit some known
geometry of the properties or

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.780
something about the scene.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.360
So have we actually done something
that recovers geometry of the scene?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.360
Well of course we have, right?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.220
We've done stereo.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.890
In fact, those of you who
are participating in the class for

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.310
credit have actually
matched stereo images.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.590
So here's an example of
some some stereo rigs.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.830
These are sort of amateur ones.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.930
You know, I love this one, right?

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.180
Build the wooden blocks,
screw two cameras on, capture a picture.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.270
Here's something a little more
sophisticated where you've got some high

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.290
end video cameras mounted on a rigid bar
that you can control the vergence angle.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.010
But of course if any of you
gone to the movies lately,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.210
you've probably paid
a lot of extra money,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.190
in order to be able to entertain
your two eyes separately.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.820
Or more precisely,
to see movies in 3D, stereo.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.130
And here's the types of,
rigs that they use.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.990
Some of you notice that's,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.870
Spielberg on the right, in the middle
I think that's James Cameron.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.730
He was behind, the making of Avatar.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.010
Avatar was one of the first movies where

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.820
3D was fundamental to sort of
the experience of the movie.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.450
And there have been a lot of 3D movies
before, and, obviously one since, but

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.020
in this non-film critic's view
of the universe, it, it is,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.200
it was a seamless blending of sort
of what you would think of as normal

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.770
imagery, but
done in 3D along with computer graphics.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.270
And so, the 3D experience wasn't
despite, wasn't just sort of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.640
the experience of 3D was actually
crafted as part of the movie.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.980
At least,
this is my part view of the universe.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.240
And it's what it really made it,
and, and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.130
the technology had come around
quite a bit with polarized light,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.740
to really be able to give you
a compelling 3D experience.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.160
There are other ways, also,
of getting depth from a natural image.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.820
One, cool one, and we actually talked
a little bit about this when we were,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.040
talking about focus pull, right?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.410
Is that the way a lens works,
focal plane is actually in focus and

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.640
then some other, and the,
when things that are further away or

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.590
in front are not in focus, so you can
go from focus to depth, all right?

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.990
In fact, here's this cute little
animation of this scene, right,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.110
where you can see that they're varying
the focal plane, and by varying

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.910
the focal plane you can figure out the
depth of different parts of the scene.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.860
All right, so that's all passive.
