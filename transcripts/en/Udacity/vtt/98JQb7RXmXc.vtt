00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.890
Here's an example of a UML, state chart that illustrates several other features

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.790
of, Harel's notation. Once again, there are three outermost states,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.810
idle maintenance, and active, and the active state itself is,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.500
has nested states inside of it. There are transitions from

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.180
idle to the boundary of active. Two transitions there,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.760
and as, as we saw similarly, each of those transitions is going to go

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.210
to the default state in the internal machine, which is labeled validating.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.570
Another thing to note here is that two of the transitions in the nested machine,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.940
in the active state, are labeled with text inside of square brackets.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.530
These are data conditions. They are tests, logical expressions on the,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.990
the the attributes of the object which is being represented by this

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.505
particular state machine. In the transition between processing and

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:05.552
printing on the right hand side of the active state,

00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:11.086
there are square brackets and inside it says not continue. Okay,

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:15.300
continue is an attribute, presumably a boolean attribute, and if it's false,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.919
then the transition can take place, otherwise it won't take place.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.460
Also between processing and selecting, there's a transition labeled continue

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.920
which will take place if the continue attribute happens to be true.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.320
The other thing to notice about this particular example is that in the bottom,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.730
on the left of the active state, there are two lines of text one labeled entry

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.920
and one labeled exit. These are actions that will take place upon

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.840
respectively entry and exit from the inner state machine,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.249
that is when a transition from idle goes to active.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.370
Before anything else happens, the read card action will be executed.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.210
Likewise, upon exit from the printing state,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.170
when all the other work is done, the eject card action will take place.
