00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.643
So, the first thing we need to know about the Nervous System is that it's

00:00:03.643 --> 00:00:09.008
divided into two main parts. We have the Central Nervous System, also known as

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:16.680
the CNS for short. And we have the Peripheral Nervous System, or PNS for short.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.759
The Central Nervous System is comprised of the brain and the spinal cord. And

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.854
the Peripheral Nervous System is comprised of the nerve cells in the body that

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:29.729
are outside of the central nervous system. Here, let's take closer look at the

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.363
Peripheral Nervous System. It's further divided into the Somatic Nervous

00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:38.230
System. And this is responsible for transmitting sensory information, such as

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.980
sight, smell or even touch to the brain and the spinal cord. Or from the brain

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.788
and the spinal cord to the skeletal muscles. The second half of the Peripheral

00:00:48.788 --> 00:00:53.080
Nervous System is the autonomic nervous system, as we see here. This system is

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.277
in charge of our involuntary systems. Such as our internal organs, like our

00:00:57.277 --> 00:01:01.260
heart or lungs. Or the glands, like our adrenal gland.
