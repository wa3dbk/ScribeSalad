00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.306
The slope is how many units a line shifts upward for every single unit that it

00:00:04.318 --> 00:00:08.823
moves to the right. For the segment joining these two points right here, you see

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:13.961
that as we move from one point to the other, we're translating 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:19.062
horizontally to move five to the right, and then up, 1, 2, 3. The ratio of this

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:23.831
vertical distance traveled versus this horizontal distance travelled is 3 over

00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:29.674
5. In the same, way if we look at what happen vertically when we move 1 unit to

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:35.052
the right, we can see that we move up by this distance, which is 3 5th of 1

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:35.429
unit.
