00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.610
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well I, for one, have a pretty tough time trying to think about an infinite

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.096
number of numbers. It would be great if we had a straightforward way to

00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:11.068
visualize this. Luckily, someone had the awesome idea to invent the number line,

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:14.931
which is this wonderful visual device right here. A number line is basically a

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.062
way of displaying all of the real numbers. We can represent whatever number or

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:22.897
range of numbers we want to on the number line just by shading in certain

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:27.130
positions on it. For example, since this dot is at the hash mark for negative 4,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.249
I have just plotted negative 4 on this number line. Even though I've shown the

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.077
integers on this number line, we can also plot any point in between two

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:39.234
integers, which is why all the real numbers can be shown on the number line.

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:43.660
Notice that just like on the x-axis of a coordinate plane, numbers increase as

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.890
we move to the right and decrease as we move to the left. I've labeled three

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.046
points on this number line, A, B, and C. And I'd like you now to tell me what

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:56.333
you think that each of these are equal to. What do you think the values at all

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.368
three points are?
