You can also respond to user
interaction with your street-view,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.720
and there's some great methods for
doing this.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.095
First of all, you can detect whenever
the camera changes by looking

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.630
at a new direction or zooming in and
out with a handler called

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.650
setOnStreetViewPanoramaCameraChangeList-
ener.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.450
If your user touches on the panorama and
you want to detect

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.310
that to respond to it, you can use to
set OnStreetViewPanoramaClickListener.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.790
If the panorama changes, typically by
the user navigating to a new location,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.540
you can also detect this using the
setOnStreetViewPanoramaChangeListener.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.610
These are all very useful if you
want to build an app that provides

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.530
information about the location
that you're looking at.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.670
For example, in the Grand Canyon Hike,
it would be really cool if you could

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.445
show the direction the user is facing in
as they pan around to look at the canyon

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:52.730
for various spots on the trail or plot
on a map where they are on the trail.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.150
See if you can figure out
how to do this for yourself.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.350
It's beyond the scope of what
you're learning here, but

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.190
it might be useful for
your final application.
