00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.060
All of these commits will be shown,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.490
including the ones that don't have check boxes next to them.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.350
We just thought it'd be kind of tedious for you to check all the boxes.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.660
This one on the other hand,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.690
won't be included, because it's not reachable by this commit.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.430
You might be wondering what order Git will show these commits in,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.440
since there are two separate paths.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.410
The answer is that the commits are sorted by the time they were created.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.720
So, the commits from the two branches might be shown as interleaved.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.010
Now Caroline will walk you through actually doing the merge and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.640
deleting the branch.
