00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.370
One common measure of affect size, when comparing means, is Cohen's d. Named

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.300
after the statistition Jacob Cohen. Cohen's d is a standardized mean difference

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.562
that measures the distance between 2 means in standard deviation units. In

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:19.559
other words, instead of dividing by standard error. We simply divide by the

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.918
standard deviation of the sample. We can think of it like this, we have our

00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:29.551
sample, let's just say it's normally distributed. And here's the sample mean,

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:33.966
and the standard deviation of our sample is S. Now let's say we have some

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:41.630
population mean out here. How many S's fit between x-bar and the mean? The

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.780
larger Cohen's d is, the further x-bar is from mu-not, in terms of the sample

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.353
standard deviation. So, go ahead and calculate Cohen's d for this example.
