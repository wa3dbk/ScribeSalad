Typing in long directory and
file names is a big, boring pain and

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.190
nobody likes doing it.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.890
One way you can avoid running out of
fingers is to use tab completion.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.880
It works pretty much the same
as tab completion for commands.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.630
As you're typing a command or
file path, just hit the tab key.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.010
If you've typed enough to
distinguish a single command or

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.260
a single file, the shell will
automatically complete it.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.730
Otherwise it will go beep.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.090
Then if you press tab again it'll list
all of the possible completions for

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.545
what you've typed.

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:30.210
Experienced Shell users use
tab completion all the time

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.970
almost without thinking about it.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.030
Try it out.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.910
You can actually use it to navigate
all around the directory structure

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.450
without ever using the CD at all.
