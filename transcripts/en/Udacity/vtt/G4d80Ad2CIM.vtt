00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.308
The outputs of f for each of these inputs are each of these numbers, 1, 2, 4,

00:00:06.308 --> 00:00:11.940
8, 16 and 32. These are just the numbers we get when we plug in each of these

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.579
values for x in 2 to the x. That means that on our function f of x equals 2 to

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:22.310
the x, we have the points 0,1, 1,2, 2,4 and so on. And that also means that for

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:31.440
the function f inverse, we have the opposite points, 1,0, 2,1, 4,2 and so on.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.416
We're definitely learning a lot about these two functions and how they're

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:35.429
related.
