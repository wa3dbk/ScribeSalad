00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.142
It turns out that i to the 5th equals i, i to the 6th equals negative 1, i to

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:10.315
the 7th equals negative i, and i to the 8th equals positive 1. Fantastic

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:14.453
pattern solving, if you found those. Now, I know these are pretty tough. So,

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:18.378
it's okay if you stumbled. Let's see how to do it. For the first one, we have i

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:23.610
to the 4th times i. We know i to the 4th already. That equals 1. So, we can

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.530
replace i to the 4th with 1. This leaves us with 1 times i, which equals i. For

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.898
i to the 6th, we can rewrite it as i to the 4th times i squared. We know i to

00:00:33.898 --> 00:00:38.533
the 4th equals positive 1 from before. And we know that i squared really equals

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:43.260
negative 1. So, we can replace that here. We multiply these numbers together to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.520
give us negative 1. For i to the 7th, we break it down into i to the 4th times

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.262
i cubed. i to the 4th equals 1, and we know i cubed is really equal to negative

00:00:52.262 --> 00:00:57.602
i. So, that's how we simplify i to the 7th to be negative i. And finally, for i

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:03.386
to the 8th, we'll have i to the 4th times i to the 4th. Both of these equal 1.

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:06.303
So, we'll have 1 times 1, which equals 1.
