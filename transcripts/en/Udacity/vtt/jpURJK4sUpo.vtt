00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.010
To see why classification is so powerful and

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.870
so ubiquitous, and also to understand what exactly is classification,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.930
let us go to our overall cognitive architecture for an intelligent agent.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.329
This is a diagram that we have come across many, many times. Let us

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.560
imagine this particular Cognitive System is dealing with a set of percepts.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.120
These percepts are in the world. So as an example this Cognitive System may see

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.010
some object, some animal when the Cognitive System goes to the zoo.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.290
This might be an AI agent, or perhaps your friend who goes to the zoo.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.090
And look at some animals and there are a large number of

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.910
percepts in that environment. Has wings, Has feathers, talons, beak and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.430
so on. And for the simplicity let's assume that each of the percepts is binary,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.180
it's either true or false. So either the animal has wings or doesn't have wings.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.190
And depending upon the percepts and the combinations of this percepts one might

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.040
take different kind of actions. So if it's a friendly animal one might go and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.400
pet it, if it's a unfriendly or dangerous animal one might run away from it.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.690
So, all kind of actions are possible. Imagine that there are some M actions that

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.790
are possible. Send, we can again imagine that there is a binary choice here.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.380
So, the total number of combinations of actions, as 2 to the power m.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.930
So as an example. If I have a, if I see a dangerous animal in a zoo,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.150
then I might both scream and run away. If I see a friendly animal,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.280
I may approach the animal and make cooing noise to the animal. So, a number of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.180
actions and combinations of actions are possible. And if n is the number of

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.400
percepts then I have 2 to the power n. Combinations of percepts possible. So

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.489
how is the challenge that the cognitive agent faces? The challenges,

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.800
that the number of percepts and the number of actions multiplied by the number

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.080
of combinations of percepts and the number of combinations of actions is very,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.360
very large. And we have to map these percepts, combinations of percepts,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.030
actions, combinations of actions. This is a very complex mapping. So

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.870
imagine that only 10 percepts. Image at environment, so I'm looking at

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.330
an animal and let's take 10 percepts that I'm paying attention to.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.970
Then two to the power 10, the number of combination of percepts is 1024, and

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.580
doing it two to the power of 10 here because I'm assuming each percept has

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.080
a binary value. If I had 100 percepts, I was not looking at one animal, but

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.320
I was looking at a scene of animals. Then I may have 100 percepts,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.070
in which case I have a much larger number of combinations. And

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.540
if I had something like 300 percepts, which is not very large number.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.550
The number of combinations is, well it's a very large number.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.780
more than the combinations of atoms in the universe. Now you and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.690
I, and AI agents more generally. Are constantly faced with a complex environment

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.560
where there are a large number of percepts, and a large number of combinations

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.150
that are possible. So let's go back to something earlier that we had considered

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.410
in the class. We defined earlier that, one way of talking what intelligent agent

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.870
is to think in terms of how can an intelligent agent map percepts into actions.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.640
Intelligence is, in part, a lot part perhaps, according to this definition,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.300
about action selection. The other aspect of this is.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.390
That if the number of perceptions is large and the number of actions is large.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.850
Then the mapping between them becomes very large and very complicated quickly.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.350
But intelligent agents have only finite resources. How is it then that we can

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.090
select the right action. Or at least most of the time select the right action.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.070
Even when the environment is very complex. And do so in near real time.
