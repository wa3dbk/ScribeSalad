00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.820
To dig into this issue of similarity between a target problem and

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.540
a source case in different domains, let us look at another example.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.070
Let us suppose it is a patient who has a tumor in his stomach.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.910
There is a physician who has a laser gun. She knows that if the laser light were

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.120
to shine on this tumor, the tumor will be killed and the patient will be cured.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.760
But the physician has a problem. The laser light is so

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.910
strong that it will also kill all the healthy tissue on its way to the tumor,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.660
and thereby killing the patient. What should the physician do?

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:36.687
This is actually a very famous problem in cognitive science. It was first used

00:00:36.687 --> 00:00:41.753
by a psychologist called Don Curry around 1926. What do you think

00:00:41.753 --> 00:00:45.522
the physician should do in this situation? Take a moment and think about it.

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:53.481
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:54.824
We'll return to the physician and

00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:59.200
the patient example in just a minute. First let me tell you another story.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.190
Once there was a kingdom ruled by a ruthless king, there was a rebel

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.880
army approaching the fortress in which the king lived. Well there was a problem.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.340
The kings' men had mined, all the roads approaching the fort.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.540
As a result, if an army was to walk over the roads, the mines would go off, and

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.300
the soldiers would be killed. So what did the army decide to do?

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.500
The army decided to decompose itself into smaller groups, so that each

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.800
group could come from a different road, and reach the fort at the same time.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.260
Because each group was small enough, the mines on the roads did not go off.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.395
The soldiers were able to attack the fort at the same time and

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:41.050
overthrow the bad king. Now let's go back to the problem of the physician and

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.280
the patient. What do you think now? Has the answer to the problem changed?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.830
Some of you indeed may have changed your answer because of this story I

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.350
told you about the king and the rebel army. One solution to this problem is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.830
that a physician would divide a very intense laser beam into several smaller,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.020
less intense beams. As these beams come from different directions, they do

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.460
not harm the healthy tissue. However, they reach the tumor at the same time and

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.324
manage to kill the tumor. You will note that this is an example of

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:15.170
cross-domain analogy. Here the target problem had to do with the physician and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.205
the patient. The source case had to do with the king and the rebel army.

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:23.530
The objects in these two situations were clearly very different.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.260
In one case we had a physician and the patient, the laser beam and the tumor.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.790
And in the other case we had the king and the rebel army, the fort and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.790
the mines. Some of the relationships were very similar.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.280
In capturing the fort case, we had a resource, the army, which was decomposed

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.086
into several small armies, which was sent to the goal location at the same time.

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:50.110
We took this battle, we took this strategy, abstracted it out,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.660
and then applied it to the patient and physician example. A physician used

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.405
the same strategy. Resource decomposes into several smaller resources, and

00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:03.100
sent to the goal at the same time. Now you can also see why the ant climbing

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.296
a wall is similar to a woman climbing a ladder. The objects are different,

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:13.590
ant and wall, woman, and ladder, but the relationship is similar. Climbing up.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.040
The cross-domain analogy is then, the objects and the features and the values of

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.580
the objects can be different. The similarity is based on the relationship.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.320
It is the relationship that is important. It is the relationship that

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.240
gets transferred from the source case to the target problem.
