00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:03.406
So let's think of a good parallel algorithm to solve this problem.

00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:06.819
So here's some of the characteristics that we want out of our algorithm.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.780
We want lots of parallelism, coalesced memory access, minimal execution divergence,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.755
and something that's easy to implement.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:16.922
And I want to show you an algorithm that gives you all of those characteristics,

00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:19.390
and then I'm going to tell you why it's a crummy algorithm.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.059
So as we're going along, I want you to think about why this algorithm isn't going to be good enough.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:25.968
So here's what we're going to do.

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:28.670
First I'm going to describe the algorithm at a high level,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.302
then we're going to do an example, then we're going look at code.

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:35.111
So at a high level, we're going to operate over our list of edges.

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:39.529
Then we're going to iterate n times, where n is the maximum depth of the graph.

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:42.033
So on each iteration, n parallel,

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.996
we can look at each edge independently in n parallel.

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:47.782
And if one end of that edge has a depth d

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:51.658
but we haven't visited the other end of the edge yet, the vertex on the other side,

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:54.891
then we set that vertex to depth d plus 1.

00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:58.335
So the first iteration will set all the vertices that have depth 1.

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:02.437
The next iteration will set all the vertices with depth 2 and so on.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.000
So let's do an example.
