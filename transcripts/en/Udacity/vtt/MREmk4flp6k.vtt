00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So once again, it's time to summarize what we've learned in this unit.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Just as English sentences could be broken up into words,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so can HTML and JavaScript be broken up into tokens,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
typically separated by spaces.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Some of the more complicated token types we looked at were number, word, and string.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Since these correspond to sets of strings, we use regular expressions to specify them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I've introduced you to JavaScript and showed you how to use regular expressions

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to specify core parts of HTML and JavaScript.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In the homework for this unit, you'll be given a chance to expand on that knowledge.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It'll be fun!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In our next exciting episode, we're going to continue our slow but steady progress

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
towards an HTML + JavaScript interpreter. Fun stuff!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Hope you join me next time.
