00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.977
So, we do still have the distance between negative 12 and 5, can be shown either

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:07.881
by taking the absolute value of negative 12 minus 5, or by taking the absolute

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:11.992
value of 5 plus 12. You'd think, though, that there would be a consistent method

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:15.952
for finding what goes inside the absolute value signs, or finding the distance

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:20.305
between two points. And, if fact there is. I'd like to remind you that 5 plus 12

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:25.127
is actually equal to 5 minus negative 12. So I'm going to rewrite this absolute

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:30.112
value expression in this way. So considering this idea what would you say that

00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:35.147
the absolute value of 14 plus 7 is the distance between? What are the two points

00:00:35.147 --> 00:00:37.825
that this measures the distance between?
