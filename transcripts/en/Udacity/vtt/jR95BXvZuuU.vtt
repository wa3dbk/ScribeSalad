00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.870
All right, so
[LAUGH] what have we learned?

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.790
I think you basically convinced
me to do the writing and

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.330
now you're the one who has actually
think about what we learned.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.770
&gt;&gt; No, no,
what we'll do is we'll end up sharing.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.680
So you tell me what we've learned and
I'll you if that's right.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.860
&gt;&gt; So there was game theory one and
game theory two and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.890
they had their own what have we
learned along the way, right?

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.117
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; All right, so

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:24.086
then what happened when we came back,
there were Scooby Doo noises.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:25.306
&gt;&gt; There were Scooby Doo noises.

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:28.570
&gt;&gt; Then we talked about-
&gt;&gt; Solution concepts.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.750
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we listed a bunch,
but we focused in on two of them.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.810
&gt;&gt; Right, and I talked about
correlated equilibrium and

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.380
the relationship to Nash equilibria.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.900
And sort of how they're awesome and
efficient to learn or

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.400
efficient to compute.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.828
&gt;&gt; What was the main idea for
the equilibrium?

00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:49.500
What was the thing that was
introduced that makes it work?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.300
&gt;&gt; Traffic lights.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.760
&gt;&gt; Better known as a shared
source of randomization.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.920
&gt;&gt; Yes, which I don’t think I
ever actually said, but yes.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.760
&gt;&gt; I heard it implicitly.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was implicit,
a shared source of randomization.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.046
In other words, that one-third,

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.930
one-third that we did with the cards
was something that we both knew

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.770
that kind of allowed us to
correlate possible outcomes.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.270
And that is again,
a shared sort of randomization.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.170
And I think even convinced you
that traffic lights are a kind of

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.450
randomization from your point
of view when you get there.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.160
&gt;&gt; So it ends up being an easier
solution concept to find the values for,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.570
but it also is it requires more power.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.190
If you don't have your source of
randomization, you can't even use this.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.800
&gt;&gt; That's right, but
it is powerful and it allows us to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.730
often come to a better outcome than
we would with a Nash equilibrium.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.039
&gt;&gt; Some definition of better.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.170
&gt;&gt; Higher expected utility.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.440
&gt;&gt; For both players, for
one player, for the average player.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.850
&gt;&gt; Well, that's on the game.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.610
&gt;&gt; And I think it generalizes
to arbitrary number of players,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.790
but the game made to see
themselves get really big.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.320
If as the number of players grows.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.350
&gt;&gt; But that's true anyway.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.590
&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.108
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right, and then I talk about

00:01:58.108 --> 00:02:04.090
a solution concept called coco values
which had an even stronger assumption.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.960
Not just that there's a source of
shared source of randomization,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.070
but there's actually
binding side payments.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.830
Meaning that there's a mechanism for
deciding who gets what once the actions

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.610
have been taken and
utilities have been distributed.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.339
&gt;&gt; Right, and this encourages

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.720
a player who might not have a reason
to do any particular equilibrium.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.600
To pick one that is beneficial to one of
the other players because that person

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.760
will share in the increase benefit.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.000
&gt;&gt; Right, so it encourages a pareto
optimal response that is to say that in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.040
particular they're going to choose
the outcome that has the largest total

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.330
reward and then they're
going to divide up that reward.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.880
&gt;&gt; Did you mention greater optimal
when we were talking about this?

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.782
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; It was implicit much like shared

00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:53.080
source of randomization.
