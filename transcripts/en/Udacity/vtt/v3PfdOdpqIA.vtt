00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This question asks about perfect ciphers.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Assume that m1 and m2 are messages selected from M, the set of all possible messages.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You should not assume that all messages are equally likely.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
c is a ciphertext selected randomly from the set of all possible ciphertexts.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
k1 and k2 are keys selected randomly from K, the set of keys.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The question asks to check all statements that are true.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If a cipher has fewer keys then possible messages, it is not a perfect cipher.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
AES is a perfect cipher.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If the probability of m1 encrypted using the key k1 equals c is

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
greater than the probability of m2 encrypted using the key k1 equals c,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
then E--the encryption function--must not be a perfect cipher.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The last statement--if E is ap perfect cipher, then the probability of m1

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
encrypted using k1 equals c is equal to the probability of m1

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
encrypted using key k2 is equal to c.
