00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.242
Okay, so we have 2 polynomials that we
are trying to add together. And this may

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:08.573
sound silly, but if we're adding one
quantity to another, we're actually adding

00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:15.020
+1 times this quantity. Anything, 
let's say some number a, times 1 is

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.753
just equal to itself. So a times 1 is a, 
and 5 times 1 is 5, and 4x^2 times 1 is 4x^2,

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:26.773
and -2x times 1 is-2x.
So having the parentheses here with the

00:00:26.785 --> 00:00:32.024
plus sign in front of them doesn't change
the value or the sign of any of the terms

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:36.634
inside the second set of parenthesis. So
we can just write it but without the

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:40.045
parenthesis. There's also nothing
happening to the first set of parenthesis,

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:44.907
at least not yet, so we can just rewrite
it without the parenthesis as well. And

00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:48.510
now, we have a thing that we have a ton of
practice we're dealing with. We just need

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:52.193
to rearrange our terms and simplify. Once
we've rearranged we combine our now

00:00:52.193 --> 00:00:56.875
adjacent like terms. So for x^2 term we
have 11x^2.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:02.931
And now I'm dealing with the x to the
first terms, +2 -2 is just zero, so these

00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.863
cancel each other out. And we don't have
any term in the final answer with an x^1

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:12.205
in it. Then we just have 1+4 so our final
answer is 11x^2+5.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.482
I just love doing these problems so much.
because you start out with something

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:18.787
that's so complicated and messy looking,
and you end up with a really, really

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.543
beautiful simple answer.
