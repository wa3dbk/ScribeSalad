00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.323
Here is the outline of the dart throwing program. We need to complete the part

00:00:03.323 --> 00:00:07.782
here where X and Y should be random numbers between minus one and one. So we

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:10.950
can't just call generator next double, cause that gets a value between zero and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.374
and one, and we want a value from minus one to one. So here's the trick, take

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:19.564
the value from zero to one, multiply by two. That gives you a value from zero

00:00:19.564 --> 00:00:23.682
to two, and then you subtract one, which shifts it to the left by one. Here is

00:00:23.682 --> 00:00:27.870
the final expression. And of course the very same expression will work for y.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.172
Now we need to find whether the point lies in the unit circle. He can compute

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:34.538
the distance just like you've done in the telescope problem, but it's actually

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:38.887
a little easy in this case. I can take the square of the distance, and check

00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:43.420
whether that's less equal one, because the square root of one is just one.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.390
Don't worry about it if you're just used to formula. It's not a math class, so

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.198
any correct formula will do. Let's run the program. And once the number of

00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:55.514
tries, we'll try a million and we get a pretty respectable estimate for pi. And

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:59.052
like a said there are better ways of computing pi, but this method of using

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:02.706
random numbers for measuring objects is really powerful when the object is

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:07.548
irregular. When it's easy to find out whether a point lies in it, but when it's

00:01:07.548 --> 00:01:10.620
hard to compute the area with traditional means.
