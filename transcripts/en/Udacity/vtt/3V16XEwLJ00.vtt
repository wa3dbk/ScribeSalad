00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.690
To help you review for the second exam, we're going to look back now through

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.985
lesson 17 through 26, and the material we've covered during that time. Let's

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:14.440
get started. We begin by developing and understanding of functions. We ask the

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.451
question, what is a function? As you learned, a function pairs each input value

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:23.908
with exactly one output value. Which means we can figure out if a graph

00:00:23.908 --> 00:00:29.150
represents a function by using the vertical line test. We then looked at domain

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.488
and range as well as explored what it means for a function to be either even or

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:38.513
odd. From there, we investigated the overall shape of a function. Going all the

00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:42.047
way from minus infinity to infinity in the domain, looking at whether it's

00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:48.292
increasing or decreasing, and whether it has maximum and minimum points. This

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:51.737
led to a discussion about finding real zeros, which, as you remember, are the x

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:56.902
coordinates of the graph's x intercepts. And we used a polynomial long division

00:00:56.902 --> 00:01:02.130
to help us along the way. To help us narrow down the list of possible rational

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.148
zeroes for a polynomial function we used the Rational Zero Theorem. When we

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:10.328
couldn't find the exact values of zeroes that we could see on graphs, the

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:16.046
intermediate value theorem helped us approximate their locations. With

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:19.378
Piecewise Functions, we got to put together some really interesting graphs, and

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:24.298
start thinking more about domain and range. This prepared us to work with

00:01:24.298 --> 00:01:27.886
rational functions, whose vertical, horizontal,and slant asymptotes restrict

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:32.753
their domains and ranges in particular ways. Lastly, we explored

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:37.028
Transformations of Functions. Rigid transformations include vertical and

00:01:37.028 --> 00:01:41.293
horizontal shifts as well as reflections in the x and y axis. Nonrigid

00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:44.597
transformations, on the other hand, distort the shape of functions by

00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:50.706
stretching or shrinking them. We encourage you to review the practice problems

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:55.892
at the end of each lesson, the problem sets and the summary review videos. Best

00:01:55.892 --> 00:01:57.640
of luck to you. We know you'll do well. [BLANK_AUDIO]
