00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.687
Let's try some practice. Here are two new functions. And I want you to find

00:00:04.687 --> 00:00:08.812
each of these. Remember that for these you should have 1 number as the final

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:14.110
output, and here you should have a function that uses x. Good luck.
