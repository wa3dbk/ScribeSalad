00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.120
Now that we've defined the basic
geometric objects of study for

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.010
this course, vectors, we can talk
about how to manipulate them.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.100
In the upcoming lesson,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.970
you will begin programming your
personal library of functions for

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.930
operating on vectors, which you will use
throughout the remainder of the course.
