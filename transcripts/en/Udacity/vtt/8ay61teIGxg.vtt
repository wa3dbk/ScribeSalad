00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:04.190
Thanks for telling us about the
importance of proper dessert selection.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.290
So let's choose our desserts now.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.830
The earliest platform version that
our Apple support is Gingerbread.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.860
At the current time, choosing
Gingerbread means we can cover over 99%

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.070
of the devices active
on Google Playstore.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.690
It's also the cutoff for using Google
Play services for things like maps and

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.540
location and
the Android support library.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.400
The support library package offers an
implementation of ui features that were

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400
added in later releases of Android but

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.750
now can be used on older
versions of the platform.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.040
So it's really useful.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.825
Notice how we picked the latest
version of Gingerbread with API level

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:39.220
10 because it contains additional bug
fixes that API level 9 doesn't have.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.320
The we can go ahead and click Next.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.340
We're going to choose the template,
Blank Activity with Fragment.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.580
For background context and
activity serves as the present layer for

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.890
our UI, and a fragment represents
a behavior or portion of the screen.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.995
And now we have an option to modify
the names of the files that will be

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:56.770
auto-generated from the wizard.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.210
The name of our activity
is MainActivity, and

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.720
the layout will come from activity_main,
which is an XML file.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.730
In a similar fashion, the fragments
layout will come from fragment_main,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.130
which is also an XML file.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.525
I'm going to do a small change for
the name of the menu file to be called

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:18.220
main.xml because on a older version of
Android's tu, that was the default name.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.640
Then we go ahead and hit Finish.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.960
And now you should have a newly
created sunshine app with the files on

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.060
the left here.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.540
By default, you may see
the Android view of the files,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.510
which is a flattened version
of the project structure,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.890
and it highlights the key Android
source files that you'll need to edit.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.030
In this course, though, we're going to
be using the project view because that's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.145
what we had in the older
version of Android Studio.

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:39.405
You can choose any view that you prefer,
though.

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:41.875
Make sure you wait for
the gradle build to finish.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.895
If you have any errors, you can check
the guide and instructor notes below.

00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:47.125
As a tip,
you can check the build.gradle file,

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.795
which is located under the App folder.

00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:52.235
You want to make sure that
the compileSdkVersion and

00:01:52.235 --> 00:01:55.975
the targetSdkVersion are both pointing
at the latest stable version of

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:57.365
the platform.

00:01:57.365 --> 00:02:01.510
In this case, it's 21 for
the Android 5.0 Lollipop release.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.720
Once it's done building, we can add a
custom app icon that's more fitting for

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.290
our weather app.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.310
Right-click on the App folder and
click New Image Asset.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.680
You can choose from any of
the clip art options or

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.980
you can use the one that we
provide in the download below.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.540
Then, use a placeholder icon we
provide in a download below.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.010
Now this will show up in
the All Apps screen, so

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.790
that clicking on this app
icon will launch our app.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.280
It will also show up in the overview
space if sunshine is one of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.950
your most recent tasks.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.380
The other place you might see this app
icon is in the action bar of our app.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.420
In certain videos of this course that
were filmed earlier on Kit Kat by

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.560
default the action bar
shows the app icon.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.570
With material design on Lollipop and
later, the app icon doesn't show up

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.500
by default anymore, so
don't worry if you don't see it.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.230
It's fine, and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.330
we're going to be styling the action
bar later in lesson five, anyways.
