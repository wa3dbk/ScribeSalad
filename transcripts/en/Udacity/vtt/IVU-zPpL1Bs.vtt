00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.594
So, let me give you examples for two

00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:05.382
consecutive prices. So, here’s one example

00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:10.595
where the stock changed from 286.85, 286.83.

00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:14.460
First you calculate the Delta T, which to

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.649
remind you was the difference of those two

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:24.421
things, Xt+1 - Xt, normalized by Xt. So, why

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.151
don’t you give me your calculation of Delta T,

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.000
into this box over here.
