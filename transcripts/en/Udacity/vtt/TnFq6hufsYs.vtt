00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is the solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We start with the empty list. We go through all the elements in p.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is the tricky line.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We will construct Q element-by-element by accessing the corresponding p,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and p is shifted by U and if this shift exceeds the range of p on the left,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we apply the modulo operator with the number of states as an argument.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In this case, it'll be 5.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, the reason why there is a minus sign is tricky.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
To shift the distribution to the right, U = 1,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we need to find in p the element 1 place to the left.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Rather than shifting p to the right directly,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
what I've done is I've constructed q by searching for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
where the robot might have come from.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's of course, in hindsight, from the left.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Therefore, there is a minus sign over here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So think about this, as it's a little bit nontrivial,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but it's going to be important as we go forward and define

00:01:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
probabilistic convolution and generalize this to the noisy case.
