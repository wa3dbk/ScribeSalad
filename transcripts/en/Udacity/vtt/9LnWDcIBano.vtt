00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.775
We simply distributed or multiplied the c to each of the exponents. So that

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:09.660
would be this choice. For the base of 7, we had an exponent of 2. And 2 times 5

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.824
makes 10. For x, the exponent was also 2. So, 2 to the 5th was x to the 10th. We

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:19.616
were simply multiplying each exponent by 5. The same was true in the second

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:24.422
case. 1 times 2 is 2. 3 times 2 is 6. And 2 times 2 is 4. That's how we got 3

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:29.820
squared. M to the 6th times n to the 4th. This was a pretty tricky pattern so,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.604
great job if you found the correct answer.
