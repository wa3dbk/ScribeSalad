00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're going to write a Python program

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to check and see or to enumerate strings in this language

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so that we can check strings for validity.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here I've written a grammar, but it's on kind of a pencil and paper format

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with these arrows and what-not.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm going to need to encode it so that Python can understand it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
just like we had to encode the edges in our finite state machine

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so that Python could understand them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Here on the right I've written a potential Python encoding for this grammar.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Expression goes to expression plus expression.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The way I'm going to encode this is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
if we had A goes to B, C, I'm going to make that the rule A goes to B, C.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We've got the left-hand side and the right-hand side,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
left-hand side and the right-hand side.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Expression goes to expression plus expression.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Expression can also go to expression minus expression

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
or expression in parentheses, or just number,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and here I'm writing all of my terminals and non-terminals as strings

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
just to make equality checking easier.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then given a seed utterance like print exp followed by semi-colon,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we would represent that as a list of 3 strings,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and what I want to do is take our grammar rules like this one

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and our utterances like this one and combine them together

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to get--I've replaced the expression that was already in here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Using this rule, I've replaced it with expression minus expression.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Well, if I've stored this in a Python variable called "utterance,"

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and the position I want to change is position 1--that's where I'm going to apply this rule--

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I can get out this cool result with this Python

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that uses list selection.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Utterance from 0 up to but not including pos,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
this part here corresponds to this part in our example,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the word "print," something that came before the part we were interested in.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The right-hand side of the rule was expression minus expression,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and then the rest of the utterance, this semi-colon,

00:01:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
something else we weren't concerned with this time.
