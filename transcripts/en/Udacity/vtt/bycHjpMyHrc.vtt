00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.090
We have a server that can say hello, so

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.220
now let's add some more
functionality to it.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.840
Most modern websites have
more than just one page, so

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.280
let's figure out how to add
this feature to our web server.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.770
In this section we will see that our
server can handle different types of

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.990
GET requests, and respond with
different types of messages.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.590
Instead of replying with hello,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.110
let's make a page that also replies in
Spanish when we visit the hola URL.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.280
I'm going to copy my if block
from before and paste it below.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.020
I will change the message
that said hello in English,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.480
to hola in Spanish,
using this special entity code that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.820
HTML will render as
an upside-down exclamation point.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.340
I will also add an anchor tag to link
back to my original hello page, just so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.010
we can see how that's done here.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.050
Now, I'm ready to try and
run this and see what happens.
