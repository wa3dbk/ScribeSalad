00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.236
Multiplying the right-hand side out, gives us the expression 3x squared minus

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:08.226
30x plus 75. So, what was the point of multiplying this out? Well, we can see

00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:12.510
now that the right-hand side doesn't really tell us anything clearly about where

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.582
the vertex is. And if we subtracted 2 again from both sides and got this fully

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:20.806
in the standard form for the equation of the parabola, then we would really have

00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:25.286
no idea right away where the vertex was. Keep these two different forms, which

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:29.641
are equivalent ways of writing the equation for this curve, in mind, as we move

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.181
forward.
