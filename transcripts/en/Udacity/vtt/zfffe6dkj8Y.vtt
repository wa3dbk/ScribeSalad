concurrently executing machines, they have nothing whatsoever to do with them.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.090
Why did you put them in the diagram in the first place? They're there because,

somehow they're cooperating. And, that cooperation needs to be coordinated or

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.520

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.250
broadcast events, and the other is the data conditions that we've already seen.
