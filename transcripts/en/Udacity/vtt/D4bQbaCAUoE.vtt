00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.898
Well, what happens when we roll two dice at least 100 times, and then we took

00:00:04.898 --> 00:00:09.227
the average of the two rolls? This is similar to what we did with the

00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:15.100
tetrahedral die. So if we calculate at least 100 averages from rolling two dice,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.323
what's going to be the distribution of these averages?
