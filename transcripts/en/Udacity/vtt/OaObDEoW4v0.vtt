00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.700
Let's now try to bring back some of the details on how images are captured from

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.870
these cameras, and try to get into some representations of how mathematically we

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.260
can look at all of these.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.340
Here we basically start off with an image that we want to capture, and

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.120
this is my sensor.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.680
As we looked on the image processing and image representations, most of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.410
the time we represent an image in this form with x and y, or columns and rows.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.460
Of course the 3D world has this coordinate axis, Y up X, and Z which could be

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.420
sometimes, in this case, be respective as we go down into the scene.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.700
So imagine if this is my object in the scene,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.470
what would it actually look like in a 3D camera?

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.970
So to help us kind of get into understanding this kind of concept of

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.100
a camera model, let's imagine I have an object in this 3D scene.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.660
To help us, we will actually unwrap this.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.910
And now I'm showing the Z-axis, and this way X and Y, so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.770
I've kind of turned it around and looking at this scene from this direction, and

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.890
that, that basically is the way I'm looking at it here.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.910
So this is my object, and again shown here.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.060
Basically, I'm just going to give it some value, X, Y, and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.970
Z, which basically is this point here of this object.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.950
We can basically look at all the values, so X is this,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.040
Z is this, sorry Z is, Z would be this value.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.470
X is this value and Y would be up how high this object is.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.520
Of course the tracing the ray through and imagine this to be a pinhole, so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.968
this is my pinhole of the camera itself.

00:01:28.968 --> 00:01:30.320
Ray goes through here.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.670
And of course on the other side,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.290
I should be able to now think about where the image will be formed.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.380
We'll get an inverted image on that side there,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.510
and of course it's on that side of the X axis.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.790
And this would be the value in the image plane on the sensor.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.970
And it's my sensor, this is where the image forms on that side of the camera.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.220
So the camera pinhole is here, the sensor is here, 3D scene is here.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.370
We know that, of course, the sensor should be at the focal plain.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.610
Now using similar triangles we can actually start finding out

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.760
more information about where the values of this would be.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.150
The similar triangle basically says that the ratio of xi over f,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:14.390
which is xi over f, should be the same as X-non which is this value here.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.140
So xi is this and focal length of course is this.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.940
Similarly, X0 is this and in place of f we have the Z value here.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.850
So xi over f is equal to X-non over Z-non.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.470
And similarly for y, we can do the same thing and come up with this equation.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.410
We can simplify this to now be able to get the values of xi and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.900
yi with this relationship.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.050
So as long as I know,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.780
of course, the, how far the object is from the scene and where it is, I should

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.280
be able to now figure out where the pixel value would be on that image itself.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.670
Of course, we not, not all the time do we know these values from the real word,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.850
especially just from an image.
