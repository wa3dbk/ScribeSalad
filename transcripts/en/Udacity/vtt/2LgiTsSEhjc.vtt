00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.116
I'm standing here by the Google Corkboard

00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:07.520
Server Rack. This server rack was built in

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.840
1999 by Google employees simply because you

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.770
could not buy the computers required to achieve

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.390
the scale, reliability, and performance that Google

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.770
required. Each row here, has eight hard drives

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.880
on it, and four complete PCs. And there is a cork mat, to shield the electronics

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.370
from the metal frame that carries the row up.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.130
That's why it was called the Google Corkboard Server

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.480
Rack. When your application runs on the Google Cloud

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.720
platform, you can be sure it runs on the

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.140
latest and best hardware. Well, perhaps not this version

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.510
from 1999. But the latest version that we built.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.410
So, in this lesson we're going to cover the heavy

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.710
duty stuff. We'll start it off by looking at memcash,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.370
a great way to optimize the performance of your application, then we'll

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.975
look at background jobs. In the form of push queues, pull queues,

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.840
and cron jobs and we'll wrap it up by looking at some

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.930
of the scaling and tuning parameters for appendium. Let's get started, shall we?
