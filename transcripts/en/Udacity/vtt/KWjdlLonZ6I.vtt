00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.340
Before we go any further.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.930
It would be great if our view controller
where the recording happens was called

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.880
something other than
just view controller.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.780
In writing your app,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.600
there are times when you might
want to rename your classes.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.960
And it takes just a minute.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.250
Let me show you.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.360
To rename our view controller,
we're going to do three steps.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.460
We want to change the name
of the view controller

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.920
to Record Sounds View Controller.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.987
First, in the project navigator S=select
a viewcontroller.swift file and

00:00:25.987 --> 00:00:26.750
single click.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.070
Change the name to record
sounds view controller.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.830
Open the class we just renamed and
change the name in the comments and

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.870
in the class decoration to
record sounds view controller.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.800
You can press command
s to save this file.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.520
One last step, we have to tell the
main.storyboard that the view controller

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.760
for this view, is no longer
called ViewController.swift, but

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.968
it's now called
RecordSoundsViewController.

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:54.810
Open the main.storyboards file and
select a view controller for

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.060
a first view.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.120
Switch to the identity inspector and

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.050
change its name to
RecordSoundsViewController.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.490
Press return to make this take effect,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.990
that's all it takes to
change in name of a class.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.380
Next, let's add the AV audio
recorder code you saw earlier.
