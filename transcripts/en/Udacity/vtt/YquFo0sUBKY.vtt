00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.280
So what the partial or the planner has done so

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.700
far is to view the two goals as if they were independent of each other.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.480
And come up with a partial plan for each of the two goals. It has not yet

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.180
detected any conflicts between that will not resolve those conflicts.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.450
The next thing would be to examine the relationship between these two plans and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.030
see if there are any conflicts between. But how might a partial order plan

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.800
go about detecting conflicts between two plans? So, here is plan one imagined,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.300
here is plan two. The partial order planner may go about detecting conflicts.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.300
We're look at each precondition of the current plan. Under the precondition of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.660
an operator any current plan is clobbered by some state in the,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.670
another plan, in the second plan, than the partial order planner would know that

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.380
there's a conflict between them. [UNKNOWN] goal resolving these conflicts, but

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.740
promoting or demoting one clients goal or another clients goal.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.870
There's if some stated plan B covers the application of some operator in plan A,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.990
then we now want to alter the goals in this plan and this plan in

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.770
such a way that this operator's done before that state is achieved. Now,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.330
let us see how the partial order planner may go about detecting conflicts within

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.430
these two plans. So the partial order planner may begin with this plan for

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.645
painting the ladder. And see whether the precondition of this operator,

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:27.990
paint-ladder, are clobbered by any state in the second plan. As it turns out,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.030
that doesn't happen in this example. Now, the partial order planner will look at

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.720
the operands in the second plan. And see whether the preconditions of any of

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.260
the operators are clobbered by some status in this first plan. So

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.602
let's look at climb-ladder here. The precondition of climb-ladder is, on robot,

00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:49.080
floor, and dry ladder. And as this precondition is compared with the states.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.300
In the first plan, we can eventually see the conflict. Here is dry ladder, and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.660
here is not dry ladder. And this way the partial order planner has been able to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.080
find that the water-less states here in the first plan proverbs the precondition

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.250
of one operator on this second plan. To resolve this conflict, the partial order

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.010
planner may promote these goals or the goal of painting the ladder.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.940
Some of you also noticed that after the robot has painted the ceiling,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.470
the robot is on ladder. But in order to apply the paint ladder operator,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.170
the robot must be on the floor. So here there is an open condition problem.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.880
This particular condition where this operator is not being satisfied.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.590
When the robot is on the ladder. We'll come to this in a minute.
