Throughout this unit, we've been working with quadratic equations. Now, let's

00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:08.749
check out quadratic inequalities. A quadratic inequality looks a lot like a

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:12.409
quadratic equation, except instead of an equal sign, we'll either have a

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.129
greater than symbol, a less than symbol, a less than or equal to symbol, or a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.895
greater than or equal to sign. When we solve a quadratic inequality, we want to

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:27.720
find all the values of x that make this statement true. In this case, we want

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.622
any x value. So that way, when we evaluate this side, it's greater than 0. Now,

00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:36.790
we have an inequality here. So we know there's going to be more than one

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.086
solution. In fact, there's going to be an infinite number of solutions. So to

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:45.748
find the range of all possible values, let's start by finding which x values

00:00:45.748 --> 00:00:51.690
make this statement equal to 0. So, what two values of x make this statement

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.610
equal 0. Write the smaller number here and the larger one here.
