00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's look at a way we might try to calculate this.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.240
We need to know the number of possible states that this computer could go through

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.240
in order to know whether or not we could get to a state we've already been to

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.070
in a reasonable amount of time.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.070
How many states are there?

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.130
Each bit can be in 1 of 2 states, either 1 or 0.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.640
There are 8 bits per byte, that's 2^8 states, per byte.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.400
We have a 1,024 bytes in our memory. We have a kilobyte of memory.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:40.570
That gives us 2^8^1,024 power, which is 10^2466.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.350
This is a huge number already. This is just the possible states in our memory.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.180
How many can we go through in a year?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.120
We take 10 billion steps per second.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.870
So 10 billion steps per second is 10^9 steps per second.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.890
Now how many seconds in a year?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.500
This is just multiplying by 60 seconds in a minute, times 60 minutes in an hour,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.870
times 24 hours in a day, times 365.25 days in a year.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:21.680
This equals 10^17.5 states that we can calculate in a year.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.690
That means that really what we want to do is take 10^2466 states

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.270
and divide by this 1 year/10^17.5 states.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.940
This gives us 10^2448.5 years.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.030
This is an insanely huge number.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.700
This is for a computer that only has a kilobyte of total memory.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.500
The sheer number of states that we can be in, even in such a small memory

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.680
and especially in a larger memory like you would see in a computer today,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.930
is just so massive that calculating decidability in this fashion isn't actually feasible.

00:02:01.930 --> 99:59:59.000
This is why we still really care whether our problem is undecidable theoretically or not.
