00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
At the end of the day, we'd all prefer creating over debugging.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.380
So how can we avoid debugging in the first place?

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.350
Here's some suggestions on what you can do.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.120
First thing, get your requirements right.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.600
Only if you know precisely what to do will you be able to know what not to do.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.820
That is, only with precise requirements will you be able to tell failure from success.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.910
A famous quote coming from Brian Kernighan:

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.880
"Without specification, there are no bugs--only surprises."

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.990
So you could think that if you have no specifications,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.660
then you wouldn't have to do any debugging.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.720
Unfortunately, surprises need to be debugged just as well,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.150
except that debugging surprises is harder

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.090
because you don't know how they would not surprise you.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.160
Increase precision and automation--next suggestion.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.700
In the end, you do have this huge program

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.070
and you want to be able to find as many bugs as possible.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.040
Of course you can have developers read it, review it, test it,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.560
but in the end, the time of your developers will always be a precious resource.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.820
In other words, you won't have the developers, you won't have the time,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.570
and so you'll be pressed to ship anyway.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.600
If you can automate these tasks, then resources will be much less of a problem

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.850
because you can have an arbitrary number of computers doing the checking for you.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.580
This calls for techniques such a contracts, assertions, or other forms of specification

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.880
that can be validated automatically,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.920
plus, of course, lots of automated testing that follows.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.900
The next step is to reduce complexity.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.030
The higher the structural complexity of a program,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.210
the more ways there is for some part of a program to influence another

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.360
and the easier it is for infections to spread.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.190
Plus the higher the complexity in a program, the more possible sources for infections there are,

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.440
and all of this makes debugging way harder.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.220
Next step, set up assertions.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.910
Every single assertion rules out large parts of the program or of the program state

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.600
as an infection cause.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.510
And the more assertions you set up, the less state and statements do you have to examine

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.990
in order to figure out where the infection came from.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.420
Next thing, test early and test often.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.180
The earlier you test, the more precise your specification will be.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.190
And the more you test, the more defects you will catch right away.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.210
Plus, if you test frequently, you will be able to isolate the change that led to the test failing

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.050
by building on the past history of successful tests.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.250
Next, review your code or have it reviewed by your colleagues.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.400
Having your code being inspected by others has been shown again and again

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.140
to significantly increase productivity, quality, and project stability.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.510
Next step, go and analyze the problem history of your project

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.970
in order to figure out which components have shown risk in the past and which ones haven't.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.270
Obviously, components that had troubles in the past would always be the first ones to focus on

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.170
as it comes to improving quality.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.730
Analyze their history, their common features, common causes,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.890
and adjust the development process accordingly.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.370
Last, learn from your mistakes.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.030
Every bug you make is a bug too many.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.390
Improve your development process such that bugs are caught as quickly as possible.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.390
If a bug escapes into production, make sure it won't happen again.
