00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.713
So now that we've worked step by step through how to simplify terms, I want you

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:09.317
to try simplifying this term on your own. So, in this box to the right, please

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.662
write the most simplified version that you can find of negative 5s times

00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:17.823
negative 2r times 3t. Remember, that these parenthesis just indicate

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:23.369
multiplication. So that means that negative 2r is being multiplied by negative

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:26.781
5s, and by 3t, not subtracted from them. Good luck.
