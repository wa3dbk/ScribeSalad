00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.330
A couple of takes on components one from Richard Taylor,

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.470
a software component is an architectural entity.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:14.150
It's concerned with a unit of the system's functionality or its data.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.710
Once again, key here is the interfaces that it provides to the rest of

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.410
the world, and, according to Taylor,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.200
the dependencies on its required execution context.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.074
What that, what that means is, what does it take in order to

00:00:28.074 --> 00:00:31.528
enable the component to run in a manner that it should?

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:36.698
Szyperski offers the following, that a component is a unit of composition.

00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:38.050
We're going to take components,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.350
we're going to put them together with contractually specified interfaces.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.330
This means that the interfaces are explicit, the other components know about it,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.160
they agree to it, and that these interfaces when you're

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.450
putting things together in configurations can be checked and enforced.
