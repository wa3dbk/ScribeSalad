00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.220
We can continue this problem solving process further and solve this guards and

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.830
prisoners problem. I'll not do that here, both because it will take a long time,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.070
and because the entire picture will not fit into the screen. But

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.290
I would like you to do it yourself. And I want you to do it and

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.540
tell me how many moves does it take to move all the guards and

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.700
all the prisoners from one side to the other side of the river?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.750
Once you are done. Once you have solved the problem and moved all the guards and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.230
prisoners to the other side, write the number of moves here in this box.
