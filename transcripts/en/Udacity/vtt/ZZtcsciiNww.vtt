00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.208
Objects with UVs and textures can be imported into 3JS. I won't be describing

00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:07.319
this process, as it doesn't have all that much to do with the principles of

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.690
computer graphics. See the additional course materials for more information.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.525
What's important to know is how the UVs of an object affect how the texture is

00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:17.970
mapped to the surface. The basic principle is that by changing the UVs, we

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.744
select a different part of the texture. Here are the textures that are attached

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:25.810
to a single model. The way in which a model is associated with its texture is

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.440
called texture mapping. The spheres and other objects we saw before had fairly

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.405
natural projections of the texture onto their surfaces. For a more complex

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.850
object, such as this humanoid, an artist uses a modeling program to assign the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.545
parts of the texture to the model. When a triangle mesh has a texture applied

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:46.373
to it the texture is used by the whole mesh. Because of this, a single texture

00:00:46.373 --> 00:00:50.160
is used to hold all the different images for the various parts of the mesh.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.123
This kind of texture is called a texture atlas or a mosaic.
