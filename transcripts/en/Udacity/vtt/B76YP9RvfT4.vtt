00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.220
Crazy Bob will you please summarize all the bugs have you found?

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.810
&gt;&gt; All right. So, I'll read.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.055
I'll read basically the type,

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:11.130
the severity, the location and then the description.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.690
So, this was wrong.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.220
Minor, line one, don't import asterisk.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.017
Wrong, minor, line two, useless import or useless import of .java.lang.

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:25.952
Stylistic minor, line 12.

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:29.549
Program to interfaces not implementations.

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:31.300
Missing minor.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.840
Lines 13 and 14, no initialization of variables.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.410
Stylistic minor 13 and 14 integer versus character.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.560
Style minor lines four, seven and eight.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.120
We discussed all about our standard coding style and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.580
comments should be slash, slash asterisk.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.500
&gt;&gt; No, shouldn't.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.606
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I kind of agree with said that we should go with,

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:54.710
maybe, a minor plus plus or some kind of other severity.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.560
If, if styling is, is important as we kind of talked about maybe that should be

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.220
somewhere between major and minor.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.750
Okay. &gt;&gt; Really need to crack down on that.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.270
Make sure that one just doesn't get washed away.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.360
&gt;&gt; And also before you go to the next one Crazy Bob,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.160
please read the meaning of the redispositions again.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.420
So the first one is what?

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.380
The first one is the line number.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.870
The second sources.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So our line numbers are four, seven and eight.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.570
That's where the comments were.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.270
&gt;&gt; No, I wasn't being clear.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.900
&gt;&gt; On the form?

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.815
&gt;&gt; They're on the forum.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.046
&gt;&gt; Oh first, oh this one.

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:25.517
This is just the number.

00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:26.904
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Like consecutive number.

00:01:26.904 --> 00:01:27.433
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:28.637
&gt;&gt; Of the defect that we found.

00:01:28.637 --> 00:01:32.745
Then the type, so there's missing, wrong, extra usability, performance, style,

00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:33.801
clarity or question.

00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:37.814
And then there's the severity, either major minor, and

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:41.842
then we can add plus plusses, or minus minuses if you'd like.

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:45.166
And then it'll locate the actual line number of the code.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:51.550
So then we have style minor line 16.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.000
Follow should be in capital letters.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.126
And character was misspelled and buy was misspelled.

00:01:56.126 --> 00:02:01.343
And then stylistic minor line 19 inconsistent space in white space around, and

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:05.416
then we talked again about needing a some kind of coding standard for

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.218
white space.

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:12.345
then, wrong major plus.

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:16.410
On line 20 the equal equal should be not equal per our loop condition.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.259
Then wrong again, major lines 19 and

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:24.189
28, we're printing every character on a new line as an integer.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.485
Then stylistic major line 20.

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:30.791
We had a question about whether this loop ever even terminates, and

00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.654
we should be checking for some kind of enda file.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:36.545
Stylistic minor line 31.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:39.022
The assert comment is confusing.

00:02:39.022 --> 00:02:42.232
Stylistic minor lines 32 through 35.

00:02:42.232 --> 00:02:45.774
We should catonate all that system out into one line.

00:02:45.774 --> 00:02:50.758
[COUGH] Then wrong implementation major line 34.

00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:53.570
We're printing the wrong variable.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.370
Style again, minor everywhere is our brace placement standard.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.115
We need to come up with something, some kind of standard.

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:00.404
&gt;&gt; Mine are plus plus maybe I don't know.

00:03:00.404 --> 00:03:01.403
&gt;&gt; Then another plus plus.

00:03:01.403 --> 00:03:05.843
&gt;&gt; And then style minor everywhere, there's no java.doc author tags or

00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:08.678
any other information on the code.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:10.173
Stylistic major line 36,

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:13.862
we should catch specific exceptions rather than generic exception.

00:03:13.862 --> 00:03:15.714
Stylistic major, line 37,

00:03:15.714 --> 00:03:19.571
we should log exceptions instead of just exiting immediately.

00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:26.770
Stylistic, again major, line 39, we need an exit status on our success.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.114
Stylistic minor, lines 19 and

00:03:28.114 --> 00:03:30.859
28, we should not be printing debug information to the console.

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.718
And then I added another important one that I think is important,

00:03:34.718 --> 00:03:38.447
major everywhere our implementation should've been in Ada.

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.050
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's a minority report.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.623
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Very good.

00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:45.245
&gt;&gt; So, I think the code passes, right?

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:46.976
&gt;&gt; Thank you team.

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:52.525
I can certainly breathe easier now that we have squashed these bugs.

00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:56.781
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm going to have to neuralize you to

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:59.445
protect the identities of our team members.

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:03.897

00:04:03.897 --> 00:04:06.006
