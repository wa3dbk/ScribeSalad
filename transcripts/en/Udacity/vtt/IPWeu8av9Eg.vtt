00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.085
Well, the other interesting things that we have the teams do,

00:00:03.085 --> 00:00:05.809
and the JerseySquare guys was a great example,

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:09.009
is to the start to put together the unit economics,

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.024
the metrics that matter for both revenue and cost.

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:17.789
So, then we're going to take the annual subscription revenue, $199,

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.683
and see what their business looks like.

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:25.736
So they assumed that the cost of a jersey with 25% off to them,

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:28.543
that is, to JerseySquare was $150.

00:00:28.543 --> 00:00:31.903
They think they'll be able to rent it five times during the year

00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:35.986
but their shipping cost was about $9, their cleaning cost a dollar

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:38.069
processing cost a dollar

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:43.993
and their customer acquisition and activation cost $25 a team

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:47.140
and so if you take a look at their unit costs

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.449
you add all this up

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.285
it's $230 but their revenue was only $199.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:56.452
Why would they do this? 'Cos they were going to lose $31 a year?

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:59.655
Well, remember this was to acquire a customer.

00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:03.081
But what you need to look at is the customer lifetime value.

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:06.420
What happens when this customer renews for the next year?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.120
Well, in the next year, you don't have that jersey cost

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.152
because you're still turning that jersey.

00:01:13.152 --> 00:01:16.593
He might have only used it two or three or four times.

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:18.988
and you don't have the customer acquisition cost

00:01:18.988 --> 00:01:21.389
because you already acquired that customer.

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:23.933
You still have your shipping, cleaning and processing costs

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.584
but your unit costs are now $55

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:35.532
and if you get 60% retention, your net for those customers who stay longer than a year is $86.

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:38.048
You can immediately see some of the fallacies

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:40.366
in these first back of the envelope calculations.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.156
What if they use the jerseys seven times a year?

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:47.238
You're actually buying more jerseys per year

00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:49.471
and actually you're losing money in year two, three and four

00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:52.678
so you might want to be limiting the number of times

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:55.152
you can actually rent a jersey in a year

00:01:55.152 --> 00:01:57.921
or you could just be changing your revenue model.

00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.342
But this is a good visual way to start thinking about

00:02:01.342 --> 00:02:05.342
how to start doing the math for metrics that matter.
