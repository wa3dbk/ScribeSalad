00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.720
So when examining the 3-4-5 triangle, we saw the relationship of a squared plus

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.233
b squared equals c squared. We'll square each of the legs of the triangles and

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:15.434
then add the sum together to get the square of the hypotenuse. Here's another

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:21.066
visual of what's going on. We'll have b squared which is 16, a squared which is

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.323
9 and c squared which is 25.
