00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.180
When you read or talk about big data, you often

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.480
hear people say the three Vs. Volume refers to the size

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.880
of the data you're dealing with. Variety refers to the

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.100
fact that the data is often coming from a lot of

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.960
different sources and different formats. And velocity refers to the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.990
speed at which it's being generated, and the speed at which

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.000
it needs to be made available for processing. So let's look

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.020
in more detail at each of these. Let's start with volume.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.090
The price to store data has dropped incredibly

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.560
over the last 60 years. In 1980, the cost

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.048
per gigabyte was several hundred thousand dollars. In

00:00:34.048 --> 00:00:38.660
2013, it's merely $0.10. Although it's worth saying, to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.970
actually store the data reliably. You're going to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.600
end up paying more than that. That's particularly the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.170
case with more traditional storage devices such as storage

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.380
area networks, or SANS, which can be extremely expensive.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.190
The high cost of reliable storage puts a cap on

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.650
the amount of data companies can practically store. At some

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.120
point they say, okay, it's too expensive to store all

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080
that data. And I'm not doing anything with it. Let's just

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.090
store the critical stuff, like my actual sales. But it

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.150
turns out, as you'll see, that the data you're currently

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.110
throwing away can be incredibly useful. What we need is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.470
a cheaper way to store it reliably. And of course storing

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.200
the data is only part of the equation. You also need to be able

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.640
read and process it efficiently. Storing a terabyte of data on a SAN, is

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.080
not that hard. But streaming the data from the SAN across the network to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.734
say, some central processor, can take a

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:34.210
long time and processing can be extremely slow.
