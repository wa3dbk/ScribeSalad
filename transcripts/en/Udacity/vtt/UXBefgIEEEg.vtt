00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.074
The second model for providing
virtualization of physical devices is to

00:00:05.074 --> 00:00:09.856
allow the hypervisor to first
intercept every single possible device

00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:12.625
access that's performed by a guest VM.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:16.937
Once the hypervisor has the information
about the device operation

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:21.547
that the guest VM wanted to perform,
it doesn't have a requirement that

00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:26.025
the device that the guest VM wants and
the physical device match.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:30.268
So the hypervisor would first translate
that device access to some generic

00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:34.645
representation of an I/O operation for
that particular family of devices,

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:38.560
whether they are networked devices or
disk devices.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.790
And then it will traverse the hypervisor
resident, the VMM resident I/O stack.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.370
So the bottom of that stack is
the actual real device driver,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.880
and the hypervisor will
invoke that device driver and

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.520
perform the I/O operation
on behalf of the guest VM.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.280
Clearly, a key benefit
of this approach is that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.820
now the virtual machine is again
decoupled from the physical device.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.700
Any translation, any emulation, will
be performed by the hypervisor layer.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.410
And because of that, operations
such as sharing and migration, or

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.130
the requirements of how we need
to deal with device specifics,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.970
all of that becomes simpler in a sense.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.232
This is a model that's originally
adapted by the VMware ESX hypervisor.

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:26.600
The downside of the model is
that it clearly adds latency

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.070
on device accesses because
of this emulation step.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.020
And then also it requires
that the device driver

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.890
ecosystem is in certain ways
integrated with the hypervisor.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.710
Now the hypervisor need to
support all of the drivers so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.830
that it can perform
the necessary operations.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.510
And the hypervisor is then exposed
to all of the complexities of, and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.910
bugs of various device drivers.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.410
Again, we said earlier
in the case of VMware,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.780
because of its market share,
this model was a reasonable model,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.450
and it made sense and
it's been sustained because of that.
