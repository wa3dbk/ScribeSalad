00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.710
I recently read a post on
Humans of New York page, and

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.660
this woman mentioned in her
interview that programming is magic.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.410
It allows us to make things with words.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.580
Isn't that true?

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.490
So let's create our own magic.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.420
Let's make histogram.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.830
Firstly, let's check out
the ingredients needed

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.660
to make histogram of daily returns.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.650
To calculate daily returns,
we need to get stock prices first.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.280
To start with, we get stock prices for
the SPY for a period of three years.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.220
Next step is to calculate daily return.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.820
This is similar to what
we saw in lesson four.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.670
Now we call this function and
pass a DataFrame to it.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.120
We also plot the daily return value
by passing the daily return DataFrame

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.775
to our plot data_function.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.589
This graph show the prices of
the SPY stock over three years.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.280
And this is the daily return graph for
SPY.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.450
Now we have our base ready,
so let's make our histogram.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.690
And after five lessons,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.270
you must have guessed that even
this can be done in just one line.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.370
Here is our histogram.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.890
Professor explained
the concept about bins.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.590
We did not mention the number of
bins while plotting the histogram.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.000
The default number of bins is 10.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.610
If you look closely,
you will observe 10 sets of ranges.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.400
Can you see this?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.710
1, 2, 3, 4 and so on.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.350
If you count, there would be ten.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.840
But as usual, Python is flexible and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.510
allows us to change the number of bins,
using the bin keyword.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.360
We inform the histogram function that
we need to empty bins by passing

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.500
a parameter bins and
assigning it a value 20.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.800
Now let's check our changed histogram.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.920
Notice that the width of
each bar has reduced.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340
And the number of bars has increased.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.830
If you read this graph,
it would say that

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.480
there are approximately 300
values which lie near 0.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.250
Next we compute some statistics
on the daily return.
