00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.710
Let's talk about ASCII Chan and how we might

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.980
improve it. I know you are thinking ASCII Chan

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.360
is probably perfect already. But, that's not true. We

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.920
can make it better. When an user makes a request

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.130
to ASCII Chan, we have to do a number

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.882
of things. First thing we have to do is, we

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:20.617
have to process the request. This basically means parsing

00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:24.960
the HTTP. And parsing the URL. You know, doing that,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.960
the URL mapping to the, to the right handler. You know, just

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.000
kind of all of that overhead before our program actually starts to run.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.800
You know, figuring out what we're, what we're going to do with this

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.892
request. That takes some amount of time, you know. It, it doesn't feel

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:40.210
like a lot of time because it's actually not right now. But,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.190
if you're processing millions and millions

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.130
of requests, yeah, all that little, all

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.560
that time would add up. The next thing we do, which is much

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.160
more substantial, is we clear the database. You know, we have ASCII Chan

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.198
on our program and then we have our, our database that is full of,

00:00:55.198 --> 00:01:00.280
ASCII art of little animals and stuff. You know, our program makes a

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.660
request to the database which runs and gives us our response. Depending

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.650
on the complexity of this query, this can take

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.430
a lot of time. Not to mention, it may not

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.956
be free. If, if we're doing so many queries that

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:16.010
operation starts charging us that can be a big factor.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.780
The next thing we do in a request, is we collate

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.820
the results. You know, we may have to do some sorting, we

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.780
may have to prune some of the results out because they're

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.625
spam. You know there's all sorts of things we have to do

00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:30.360
to manipulate the results. We have to convert them into these

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.070
Python mode, Python objects from the, from our database results. All that

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.020
little maintenance stuff to get ready to actually render our HTML and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.150
then finally we render our HTML. Now if there's lots of HTML,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.180
this can actually take a lot of time. You know, on, on

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.045
Reddit, the actual time rendering all of that content, all that HTML. Was

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.277
non-trivial and that required some optimization. Now in ASCII Chan things are

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.578
pretty simple, but you know, like I said every website's is a little

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:55.363
bit different. So, what I would like you to do now just

00:01:55.363 --> 00:01:59.182
a quick quiz to interrupt things, is which of these four tasks given

00:01:59.182 --> 00:02:03.377
you know, you understand the nature of ASCII Chan, you've. You know your

00:02:03.377 --> 00:02:06.056
blog has almost the exact same structure as the ASCII Chan you know,

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:09.598
use to submit things some ways to display a list of these things. Which of these

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:11.744
items do you think is the best place

00:02:11.744 --> 00:02:15.410
to start when we're looking to improve our website?
