00:00:00.513 --> 00:00:03.935
So this Pavlov idea actually is more general than just the prisoner's

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:08.243
dilemma or iterated prisoner's dilemma. And in fact, led to a result that

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:11.860
I like to call the computational folk theorem. The idea of the

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.640
computational folk theorem says that you give me any two player, bimatrix game.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.070
&gt;&gt; What's a bimatrix game?

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.360
&gt;&gt; Just that there's two players. [LAUGH]

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.422
&gt;&gt; Okay. [LAUGH]

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:26.006
&gt;&gt; So it seems kind of redundant, doesn't

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:26.340
it?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.840
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.610
&gt;&gt; What makes it bimatrix as opposed to

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.090
two player zero sum game which you can

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.530
write down with a single matrix, this is

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.930
like, each, each player has its own reward matrix.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.287
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:38.673
&gt;&gt; But you're right, I should have, I could've just said bimatrix game and

00:00:38.673 --> 00:00:39.696
left out the two player. And it's

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:42.840
an average reward repeated game. So we're going to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.210
play. Rip, Round after round after round.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.010
And we're going to look at the average reward.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.800
Or, you can also think of it

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.950
as discounted with an extremely high discount factor.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.620
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.440
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.050
you give me one of those games. And what I

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.190
can do is, I can build a Pavlov-like machine for, the,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.046
for any of these games. And use that to construct a

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:04.489
subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, for any of these games, in polynomial time.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.882
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:09.250
&gt;&gt; And, so the way that this works is if it is possible for us

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.590
to have some kind of mutually beneficial relationship,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.586
then I can build a Pavlov-like machine. Quickly.

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:18.878
If not, the game is actually zero sum like, right? because

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.275
in a zero sum game we can't mutually benefit, so we cant

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:24.920
do anything like Pavlov we're just going to beat each other up. So

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.145
we can actually solve, linear program in polynomial time, and work out

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.330
what the strategies would be if we we're playing a zero sum

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.914
like game. And so either that works, and produces a Nash equilibrium,

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:37.528
and we can test that. Or it doesn't work, but at most

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:42.210
one player can improve its behavior. And by taking that best response

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.040
against what the other player does in a zero-sum like sense,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.610
then that will be a Nash equilibrium. So there's three possible forms

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.050
of the Nash equilibrium. But, we can tick through these, figure out

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.740
which one is right and drive the actual strategies in polynomial time.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.070
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's pretty impressive, who came up with this idea?

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.510
&gt;&gt; So this is a result due to Peter Stone and somebody, Oh yeah me.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.780
&gt;&gt; Oh, well that's very impressive,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.235
so you managed to find a way to sneak in some of your own work into this class?

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.430
&gt;&gt; Here, let's do some more of that.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm a big fan. And I think that's

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.760
fair because I did that way back when on mimic.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.350
&gt;&gt; Mimic. So, yeah, so what the last topic that, this is,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.280
that's all I really wanted to say about the Folk theorem and repeated

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.220
games. What I'd like to do now is move to stochastic games,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.940
which is a generalization of repeating games. And, talk a little bit about

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.210
how this relates Back to things like queue learning and MDPs.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.320
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. That sounds cool, almost sounds like you're wrapping up.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.400
&gt;&gt; It is, that. And that will be the end of, end of the new material.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.590
&gt;&gt; Wow. Well that means we're coming towards the end of the entire course.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.520
&gt;&gt; I know. We're going to all cry with, disappointment.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.736
And I think. And, and I just say this,

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.560
you know, as a, as an idle suggestion, that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.920
the students should demand that we teach more classes.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.570
&gt;&gt; I concur. So let's get there so that they can demand.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.792
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
