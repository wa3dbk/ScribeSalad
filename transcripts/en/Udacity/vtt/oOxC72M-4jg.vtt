Sunshine looks something like this, but it doesn't show

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.320
most of the fun information we have about the

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.710
weather. We want to show a detailed view when

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.790
the user clicks on a day within the list.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.210
Okay, that was a bit anticlimactic. It doesn't really do anything

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.610
useful yet. But it will contain all sorts of great weathery details,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.440
things that weather nerds love such as barometric pressure and that

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.220
navigators love such as wind speed and direction eventually, but baby steps.
