00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.983
Similar to ADHD, ASD is thought to be caused by a combination of genetics and

00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:11.274
environment. Some genes may make a child more susceptible to the disorder.

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:15.760
Others may determine the severity of the symptoms. Some of the genetic problem

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.030
seems to be inherited. Whereas others happen spontaneously. Environmental

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.508
factors also play a role. And researchers are examining whether viral

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:29.930
infections, complications during pregnancy, or even air pollutants can play a

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.130
role in triggering autism. What is not a cause of ASD? While there is no

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.070
evidence or reliable research that has shown a link between vaccines and ASD.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.715
That is, there is no scientific data to support such claims. Now the reason I'm

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:51.306
telling you there's no link between vaccines and ASD is because some people

00:00:51.306 --> 00:00:56.350
actually think there is a link. And one of the reasons was because of

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.431
fraudulent data that was presented by Doctor Andrew Wakefield. In his previous

00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:05.721
research, he was found to be fraudulent because he misrepresented or altered

00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:11.612
the medical records of the 12 patients he used for his now infamous study.

00:01:11.612 --> 00:01:16.034
Doctor Wakefield's misconduct was so inexcusable that Britain stripped him of

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:22.077
his medical license. Neglecting the recommended vaccines exposes children to

00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:25.522
the danger of catching and spreading serious diseases like measles, mumps or

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:32.975
whooping cough. So vaccination is key to eliminating these serious diseases.

00:01:32.975 --> 00:01:39.096
And we know now that vaccines do not cause ASD. So vaccinate. Now, let's go to

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:43.182
Lauren to talk about the anxiety disorders.
