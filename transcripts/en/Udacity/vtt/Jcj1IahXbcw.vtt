00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.650
Now we turn to our last example
of dynamic programming, and

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.220
consider the problem of
finding shortest paths between

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.530
all pairs of vertices in the graph.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.890
If you're resting on ideas like paths
and graphs, or Dijkstra's algorithm, it

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.290
might help to review these ideas before
proceeding with this part of the lesson.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.910
Note that the idea of shortest,
is given in terms of weights or

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.670
costs on the edges.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.950
These might be negative, so

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.310
we don't refer to them as lengths or
distances themselves to avoid confusion.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.320
But we retain the word
shortest with regards to path,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.940
instead of saying lightest or cheapest.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.390
Unfortunately, the use of this
mixed metaphor is standard.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.470
We're given a graph G and a weight is
associated with every edge in the graph.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.820
And our goal is to find a shortest path
between every pair u and v in the graph.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.320
That is to say,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.420
a path that minimizes the sum of
the weights involved in the path.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.690
Note that the idea of shortest here,
is in terms of these weights.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.360
These weights might be negative, so

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.680
we don't refer to them as lengths or
distances to try to avoid confusion.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.993
But on the other hand, we still
refer to the paths as the shortest,

00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:12.620
instead of saying lightest or cheapest.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.260
Unfortunately, the use of this
mixed metaphor is standard.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:19.240
Recall that for the single source
problem, where we want to figure out

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.580
the shortest path from one vertex to all
others, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.150
Which takes V times log V plus E time,
when used with the Fibonacci cube.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.200
But this algorithm requires that
the weights all be non-negative,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.710
an assumption that we
don't want to make.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.380
For graphs with negative weights,
the standard single-source solution

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.260
is the Bellman-Ford algorithm,
which takes order V times E time.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.820
Now we can run these
algorithm multiple times.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.650
Once with each vertex as the source.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.450
If we visualize the problem of finding
the shortest path between all pairs,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.406
as filling out a grid like this one.

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:56.884
Then Dijkstra or

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:02.730
Bellman-Ford would correspond to
filling out this one row at a time.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.420
One call to the algorithm to
fill out one row of the table.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.967
This strategy involves running
each of these algorithms v times.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:12.830
So we could just add a factor
of v to their running times,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.150
to get the all pairs
shortest path version.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.590
Where the weights are non-negative,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.450
this strategy of using Dijkstra's
algorithm is quite competitive.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.040
For the case where the weights
could be negative, however, and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.770
especially when the graph is dense,
we're looking at

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.570
an algorithm that is on the order of
v to the fourth for Bellman-Ford.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.990
Using dynamic programming,
we're going to be able to do better.
