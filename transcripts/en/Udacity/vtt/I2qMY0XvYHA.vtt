00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.483
So we will have a running example of, how that the muscles [UNKNOWN] work so

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:07.660
that whenever we do something, kind of, to explain it, we

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.030
will also show how it works. So, this is an example of how the issue is working.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.000
First, this is going to be our issue Q. I'm showing four instructions here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.060
This is the first instruction. This is the second one, third one and so on.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.380
So, we will issue in program order which means the first instruction that we're

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.240
going to be issue is going to be this F2 equals F4 plus F1.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.320
This is really an add but I'm writing it this way because it's more compact.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.020
Next, for each of the faulting point registers which we're going to name F1,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.144
F2, F3 and F4. There is a register alias table, or

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:44.849
RAT where we're going to keep which instructions supposed to produce that

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:49.050
register. If there is nothing here, that actually points to the register file,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.290
so pretty much if there is nothing here in F1, that's going to mean that you

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.530
can just find the value for F1 in the actual F1 in the register file.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.480
This is a register file we have four registers and this is their actual values.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.099
When we go through the example we will actually compute with them.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.140
So again this is the register file. Again the RAT when it's empty says that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.130
basically this means F1 can just be that from the register file. You don't have

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.710
wait for it. And finally we are going to have our reservation stations.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.140
We going to name them RS1, 2, 3 for the other reservation stations and 4 and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.860
5 for the multiplication reservation station. So we really have 5 reservation

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.650
stations, but note that you can use only these three for adds and only three for

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.810
multiply and divides. Now we are ready to actually issue an instruction so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.870
again this is going to be the first one we issue. The first step is to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.300
take it from the instruction buffer. The next step is to look at the RAT and

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.040
find whether our inputs are ready or not. And in this case,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.170
both of the inputs are ready. F1 and F4 are both available. So

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.650
we're going to say that this is. And add and we are going to take the value for,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.130
in this case, F4 and F1, and that is going to be 0.71 and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.590
it is going to be 3.14, and place the instruction in the reservation station,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.590
of course that assumes that there is a reservation station available, we

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.170
will see eventually, what happens when there isn't any. And the final step for

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.200
register renaming is to say that the result of the instruction F2 is going to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.940
come from now on, from reservation station 1. So here, we will write, RS1.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.130
So future instructions that want F2 are not going to read minus 1.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.670
There going to wait for this result to be produced.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.500
So this is the reining in of the very first instruction. One final step that we

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.450
will do of course is remove this instruction from the issue queue and

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.480
what's going to happen now is this is going to shift down but for

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.940
my example that's going to be very difficult to do so

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.490
I'm just going to kind of cross out this instruction. So this is,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.840
this just means that you know, this instruction has been removed from the issue

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.810
queue. To make things more interesting for the remaining instructions and

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.850
also to see what happens when an instruction is renamed, let's issue one or

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.110
two more instructions. So let's issue the next instruction, which is this one.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.990
This is a divide. We need to find the free reservation station here,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.050
say it's a divide. F2 and F3 are going to be the parameters for

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.370
this instruction. F2 comes from RS1 so we cannot simply read this value here.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.240
We're going to say here that RS1 is what we are waiting for

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.878
but F3 is available so we're going to get 2.72 from the registry file,

00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:41.940
and we now mark this instruction as,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.330
we're going to basically take it out of the issue queue and this is so

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.720
very easy to forget but when we do that. We need to mark that the result,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.130
the F1 is from now on not going to be coming from here. It's going to be coming

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.590
from reservation station 4. And we're going to issue this instruction too.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.520
It's a subtraction so it's going to go here. F1 and F2 are the parameters,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.720
we see that neither of those two can be read from the register files, so

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.410
what we'll going to do is were going to mark here that that,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.820
that the first parameter is going to be produced by RS4, the second one is

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.800
going to be produced by RS1, we'll going to then mark it. F4 is coming

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.950
from RS2,. And we're going to remove this instruction from the issue queue.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.870
Of course, more instructions are probably going to come this way, but we're

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.668
not going to look at that. Because again, that, that too many instructions for

00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:43.650
this example. Now let's say that there wasn't an issue slot here. We then.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.960
Couldn't issue the next instruction in the next cycle, until we are actually

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.540
done executing one, one of these two. I'm not going to do that but just,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.550
just keep in mind that when you want to issue an instruction you first have to

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.020
check whether reservation station is available. If not then we simply cannot

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.340
issue that instruction. Let's issue it now because we do have room for it.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.510
It's an addition. Of F2 and F3. F2 comes from reservation station 1.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.350
F3 comes from the register file. So we're just going to take the 2.72.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.300
We're going to then rename F1 to point to this result. And

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.303
now we see that F1 is already renamed to reservation station 4.

00:05:25.303 --> 00:05:31.350
That's basically, if you want to use F1, since this instruction,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.820
you would be waiting for it's result, but now F1 is being basically renamed to

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.540
another reservation station, so this is how registering and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.190
naming here works in Tomasulo's algorithm, so what we are going to do is we

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.420
are going to basically override this. With the name of this reservation station,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.530
which is RS3. And now we have issued all of our four instructions.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.640
In a real processor you would issue one instruction each cycle.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.890
And probably some of these instructions would have executed by the time we

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.640
issue all of them but I just wanted to show you how issue works if,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.250
for example, nothing could execute for some reason. Now that we

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.230
have gone through an example of issuing, let's see what the next step is
