00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.460
Now, I'll run git log on my new repository to see what commits it has.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.710
I get the error message, fatal: bad default revision HEAD.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.180
Now, head is git's name for the current commit.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.840
So, this error message is letting me know that I can't view my commit history,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.120
because there aren't any commits yet.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.260
To see that this really is a git repository, I can run git status.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.320
Status is a command I like to run frequently,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.620
because it shows which files have changed since the last commit.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.390
Right now, I can see that I'm on the master branch.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.880
We'll discuss what that means later in this lesson.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.800
Now, git would ordinarily show the most recent commit.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.770
But since there isn't one, it says initial commit here.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.600
And git says that my three files are untracked,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560
because its not tracking the history of those files yet.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.570
Now, go ahead and follow the same steps to create a repository for

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.830
your reflections.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.530
Run the commands git init and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.590
git status in the directory where you've created your reflections.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.510
When you're finished, paste the output of git status into this box.
