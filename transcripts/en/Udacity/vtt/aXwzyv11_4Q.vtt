00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my submission.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What we had to do is I built up a list called submissions.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That's going to hold the links that are submitted by this author.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The first thing I do is I iterate over the list links

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
for l in links, and if the submitter ID matches our constraint,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
62443, I add it to our list of submissions here,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and then I said sorted by time ascending,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so then I need to call sort on this list here,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and if you haven't used the sort function, it's pretty handy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You can just call sort, and that will sort by whatever the Python default would be,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so if it's integers, it sorts by integers, but these aren't integers.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
These are entire link objects, so Python would probably sort it lexicographically

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
based on how it prints out, I think, so we want to sort it on submitted time,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so that's what the key parameter is for.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And then I return the submissions, and so if I run my query,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
you can see the output down here, and you can see we have 3 links.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's not the easiest thing to read.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here is link #1, and the submission time is 133390,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and we can see our next link is here,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and we can see the submission time is 133393, so bigger, good.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And finally down here we can see our last link and its submission time is 1334.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Okay, so they're sorted by submission time, and we see they all have

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
submitter ID 62443 here and here.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Okay, so that was not too hard, but it was still a little tedious,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and this is the type of thing these types of problems a database can help with.
