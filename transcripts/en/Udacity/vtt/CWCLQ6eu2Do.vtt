00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.410
There's another approach, it's a
data-centric approach or instance based

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.500
approach where we keep the data and
we use it when we make a query.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.430
So here's an example, let's suppose
our barometric pressure has gone down

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.870
by 5 millimeters and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.400
we want to consult our model to see
how much it's going to rain today.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.070
So our query here is at -5 millimeters.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.000
And let's suppose that K is equal to 3.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.820
So we will find the 3 nearest
historical data points to this query.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.600
And those are 1, 2, 3.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.770
And we'll use them to estimate
how much it's going to rain today
