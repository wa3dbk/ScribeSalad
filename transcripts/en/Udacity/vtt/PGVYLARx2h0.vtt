00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's look at this result--after one time step, the temperature at position 0 equal 1 minus 4

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
times the time step times thermal diffusivity divided by the square of Δx.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What we want temperature should diffuse to the left and to the right.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Eventually, everything should ever reach out--in this case, to zero.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So we want to pick the step size in such a way that our function

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
eventually decays to zero as time tends to infinity.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What choice of time step do we have, does the time step have to be less than 1/4  Δx²

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
divided by thermal diffusivity or twice that ratio or exactly that ratio or 1/2 that ratio.
