00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:02.930
There are five sorts of classes involved in the visitor structure.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.540
The participants, one is of course,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.590
the visitor itself, which is an abstract class declaring a visit operation,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.510
that is then applied by each of the concrete elements.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.200
ConcreteVisitors are specialization of the visitor class,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.270
implementing an operation on each of the concrete elements.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.390
And, in addition, they may store local state, that is,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.190
if your navigation wants to accumulate statistics,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.020
there's a place to do that accumulation inside the ConcreteVisitor.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.369
The Element class is an abstract class declaring the accept operation that takes

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.166
a Visitor as an argument.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:38.240
It is sub-classed by Concrete Elements, representing the various different

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.940
kinds of nodes in the complex data structure, and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.290
each of those elements takes an except operation with a Visitor as an argument.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.190
Finally, the fifth of the classes is the Object Structure class,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.280
itself, which usually provides a way of enumerating the various elements,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.210
serving as the root of the data structure itself.
