00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.240
Now, let's share this
prototype with someone.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.390
There are three ways to do this.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.230
First, you can select
the Share Link button.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.250
This allows you to generate
a unique URL that anyone can view.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.190
Your project screens can be viewed
on a desktop or mobile device.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.100
Anyone with this link can view, interact
with and comment on your screens.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.530
You can email it, SMS it, embed it or
even download it for offline viewing.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.650
Simply copy and paste this URL,
and send it to your participant.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.900
Second, you can add someone to
your project as a collaborator.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.770
Adding a collaborator to your project
effectively gives them full edit access.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.730
This enables to view, interact with,
comment on the screens, edit and

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.110
add and remove screens as well
as edit and add hotspots.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.940
To do this,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.060
simply click on the plus sign in the
upper right of your project home view.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.020
Adding a collaborator will give that
person full access to your project.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.380
Third, you can start
an instant LiveShare event.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.910
A LiveShare meeting enables you to have
a real time collaborative discussion

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.780
with anyone with Internet access.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.690
Participants of your meeting can draw,
add comments, and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.530
view your project in a one-time event.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.820
You can have unlimited
participants in your meeting, and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.470
you don't need to book
your meetings in advance.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.930
Plus, you can have as many
LiveShare meetings as you need.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.010
Simply copy and paste this link and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.900
send it to anybody you want to
participate in your meeting.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.890
You can turn on a VoIP call here
where people can join a VoIP, or

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.140
you can have them dial into this phone
number for a private conference line.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.620
In the bottom left, you'll see
that there's a group chat window.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.270
Participants can turn
on the drawing tool,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.120
where you can draw over your designs, or
you can turn on a whiteboarding option.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.070
Any of your designs can be
saved to a Snaps folder or

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.330
emailed to all of your
participants on the fly.
