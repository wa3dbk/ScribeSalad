00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.179
Now that we've learned about factoring by grouping, let's try another practice

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:11.646
problem. Here, we have four terms one, two, three, four, 18x squared minus 9xy

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:16.222
minus 30x plus 15y. Since there is four terms, we know that we're going to be

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:19.845
factoring by grouping and I want you to put your answer in this box. Don't

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.489
forget to factor out the GCF if you can find one.
