00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.710
For the theoretical component of this course there's no required textbook.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.680
It is recommended, however, that you have access to some solid operating system

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.900
textbook as an additional reference.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.852
There are a number of options out there from a variety of authors.

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:16.274
And there are also many books that are available online,

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:18.840
including with completely free content.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.020
My personal favorites are the Silberschatz operating systems books,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.430
often called the dinosaur books because of the dinosaur on the cover.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.410
There is one that includes more detail, Operating System Concepts, and

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.270
then an abbreviated one, Operating System Concepts Essentials.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.990
I also like the Tanenbaum textbook called Modern Operating Systems.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.480
And to this one, I have personally contributed to the Linux case study chapter.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.450
If you look online,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.660
each of these books has a number of available online resources.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450
There's some slides for the chapters.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.740
There's some free available text online.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.620
And there are also affordable Kindle editions that are for rent even.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.740
And there is also a lot of material that's freely available online.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.291
There's one recent title prepared by Andrea and Remzi Arpaci-Disseai.

00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:06.472
It's called Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces.

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:10.174
This is a good book and its content matched fairly well with the content that

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:12.140
we'll cover in this course.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.480
For certain lectures, I will also provide you with specific references from

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.840
which the lecture content is drawn.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.540
Mostly these will be research papers, and some of them can be quite old.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.010
But they're still quite seminal works in computer science.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.940
Less often there will be some tutorials, manuals on specific OS technologies, or

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.810
even technology surveys.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.050
In any case, all of these resources will be linked to in the Instructor Notes or

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.150
in the Course Wiki online.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.980
Finally, regarding the programming aspect of this course,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.530
I said that you will be required to program in C in a Linux environment and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.110
that your programming assignments will require multi threaded programming.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.610
To help with these topics there are a number of resources online for

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.070
C programming, for threading libraries such as PThreads.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.670
And we'll make sure to provide links to some such content with your

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.555
programming assignment
