We got some great practice with adding and multiplying and dividing by fractions

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:08.363
in the last quiz, or the last several quizzes, but there's actually a different

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:12.404
way that you can do this problem that let's us avoid having to deal with a lot of

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:16.559
those steps. This time, instead of starting out by dividing each side by 3, I'd

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:20.728
like you to use your knowledge of the distributive property to just simplify the

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.353
left side of the equation. If instead that's your first step, what do the two

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.908
sides of the equation look like afterward?
