00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.737
We've seen how to make horizontal and vertical shifts happen for all sorts of

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:10.860
functions. And we've also seen how to reflect in the x and y axis. These types

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.700
of transformations are typically refererred to as rigid transformations,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.210
because the basic shape of the graph doesn't change. All we're doing is

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.601
translating it around the coordinate plane. Or flipping it over. Only its

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:29.300
position changes. We can also, however, have nonrigid transformations. These

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.475
involve the stretching or shrinking of a function. Nonrigid transformations

00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:37.814
distort the shape of the original function. We're going to deal with this

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:42.645
stretching and shrinking with something familiar right now. Parabolas. Here are

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:46.260
a bunch of parabolas that have been stretched in different ways. I'd like you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.030
to match each one with the equation it corresponds to. Please write the letter

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.240
of the parabola in the proper box.
