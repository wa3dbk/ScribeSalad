00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.950
In the spreadsheet, one thing you can do is write equals stdev, and that's the

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.859
spreadsheet's function for finding the sample standard deviation. And then

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:18.605
you'll put your cell numbers here. So in the case of Gettysburg you would have

00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:23.940
a2: a19. But it's also really good to practice doing it step by step, rather

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.495
than just using one function to figure it out instantly. If you round to the

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:34.922
100th place again, we would get the sample standard deviation for Gettysburg is

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:38.400
2.65 and 2.18 for Wilma.
