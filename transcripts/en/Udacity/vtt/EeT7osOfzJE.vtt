00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.642
So now I'm going to give you a touigh question. Which ironically is the same

00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:09.689
exact question I asked you before. But this time use the Z table to approximate

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:14.878
the proportion of people who have less than 240 Facebook friends. So this might

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:19.962
be tricky, but spend some time on it, and I think you can do it. And remember,

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:24.799
whenever you are doing math, think about it logically. 240 is about here. So

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:29.783
should your z score be negative or positive? Should it be between zero and one,

00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:31.255
or between one and two?
