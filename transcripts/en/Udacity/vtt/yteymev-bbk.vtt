00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.210
One of the things the operating
system does is protect

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.430
resources that need to be protected.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.740
How does that work?

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.310
Well, the way it works is
because we give control of

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.620
the resources to the operating system.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.530
We say you can't directly, untrusted
applications can't directly access it.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.450
So, operating system has control and

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.370
it's actually going to control access to
these resources, and we know it can do

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.400
that because of the complete
mediation requirement that we have.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.737
So, anybody who wants access to such
a resource actually has to come through

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:37.805
the operating system and when they
come through the operating system,

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:41.936
the operating system is going to be
able to say yeah this is okay or I'm not

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:46.380
going to allow or grant access or I'm
going to deny this particular request.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.345
So how does the operating system
actually sort of mediate these requests

00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:53.140
that we're going to have for
various resources and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.710
that needs to be protected?

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.280
First it must establish
who's making the request.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.790
What is the source of the request?

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.978
Request always has a source.

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:06.360
The entity that's making the request and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.770
it has a target which is the resource
that is being requested.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.970
So the operating system has to
know who is making the request and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.810
what is being requested.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.210
So the who part is typically answered
by this thing we called authentication.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.390
We're going to talk more
about it in a future lesson.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.600
But authentication essentially
establishes on whose behalf

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.540
a certain application or
a process is running.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.390
So that's the user who's
making the request.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.080
Once we know who is making the request

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.810
then we have this thing called
authorization or access control.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.920
This is really checking,
looking up if this source of the request

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.860
is allowed to access the resource for
which the request is being made, okay.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.040
You may be allowed to
access a certain file or

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.020
you may not be able to access a file
because it doesn't belong to you.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.480
So the check that we're going to do
is called the access control check.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.530
So the trusted computer base of
the operating system really does

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.008
It doesn't decide who accesses
a given resource or not.

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:10.720
That's called select policy.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.310
You have to decide who you're
going to share your resources with or

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.010
what other applications can share
a given file that you have.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.570
So that's the policy.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.710
But the fact that when a request for

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.010
the resource comes,
being able to do that access check.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.170
The mechanisms are essentially that part

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.360
which intervene between
the source of the request and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.910
the check that we going to do to
determine if the policy that we have in

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.330
place is going to tell us whether
the resource can be granted or not.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.440
So the mechanism is essentially
this check that we are performing.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.410
And the goal of address computing
base is to implement and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.560
do that in a structured fashion
the checks or how the mechanisms for

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.190
doing these checks that going to allow a
variety of policies to be implemented or

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.680
supported in the system.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.580
The protection of the resources
when you talk about it.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.200
Always we have to know where
the request is coming from.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.010
Whether the the requester
is allowed to access it and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.460
that's what the trusted computing base
has to do and it does it by providing

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.970
these mechanisms to support variety
of access control policies.
