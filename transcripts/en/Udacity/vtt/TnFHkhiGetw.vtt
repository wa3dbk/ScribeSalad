00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.670
So let's take the notion of constraints. Consider this cube again. You'll notice

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.495
this cube has junctions, and these junctions have different kind of shapes. For

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:13.589
example, this looks like a Y junction, this looks like an L junction,

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.956
this also looks like an L junction, it's just that this arm of the L is coming

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:22.470
in the other direction. This also looks like an L junction. This junction,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.410
on the other hand, looks a little bit like a W junction. So,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.600
junctions of various kinds. Here are the kind of junctions that can occur, in

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.960
the world of trihedral objects like cubes. Y junction, W junction, T junction,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.640
L junction. We can say a little bit more about each of these junctions.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.715
Let us look at the Y junction first. If we examine the various kinds of

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.180
Y junctions that get formed in the world of trihedral optics, then we find that

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.550
whenever there is a Y junction formed, then each of these lines

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.060
represents a fold, where a fold is a line where two surfaces meet.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.129
Now, the important thing about this is. That if we can infer, that this is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.350
a Y junction and that this line represents a fold, then an image that follows,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.670
this line must also represent a fold, and this line must also represent a fold.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.395
Actually I should tell you quickly, that in the world of trihedral objects.

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.710
Y junctions can have multiple kind of constraints. But right now,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.640
let's just look at this one single constraint. So in the case of an L junction,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.020
which has a shape like this, in the world of trihedral objects, an L junction

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.760
is characterized by this being a blade, and this being a blade, where a blade is

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.960
a line, well we cannot infer that two surfaces are getting connected with each

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.950
other. Again, the L-Constraint can actually have many more formulations. But

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.680
right now, we're keeping it simple just looking at one single constraint for

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.740
the L junction. Similarly, in the world of trihedral objects, one of the ways in

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.580
which a double junction gets characterized is through a blade,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.750
fold, blade. In effect, we're defining a spatial grammar here, for

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.320
the world of trihedral objects. The equivalent of this, in case of grammar of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.830
natural language sentences might be that a sentence can have a non phrase,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.430
followed by their verb phrase, followed by a propositional phrase, and so on.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.610
Given this set of very simple constraints for the world of trihedral objects,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.260
let us see how these constraints actually can be propagated, to group edges and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.050
to surfaces
