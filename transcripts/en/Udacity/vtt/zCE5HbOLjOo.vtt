00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.481
For quadratic inequalities, we can show the solution in one of two ways. On a

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:08.243
number line, we know that these values satisfy the inequality and these values

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:13.894
do as well. We use parentheses at x equals negative 3 and x equals, 4 since we

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:20.135
know these numbers make the equation equal to 0. These two numbers would not be

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:23.584
part of the solution set. The other way we can write our solution set is in

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:27.666
interval notation. Keep in mind, since we have two non-overlapping regions,

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:32.334
we'll need to use the union symbol in between the two intervals. What I want

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:35.470
you to do is to fill in each of these boxes using the correct interval

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.945
notation. Be sure to use parenthesis or brackets and include the infinity

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:43.250
symbol or the numbers as necessary. Good luck.
