Let us do an exercise on deep relationships. Let's get back to for example

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.600
the solar system and the atomic structure. Let us suppose that you've given this

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.840
representation of the solar system and this representation of the atomic

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.059
structure. How would you map the solar system to the atomic structure?
