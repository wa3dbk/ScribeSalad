00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.090
I don't want to go into the specifics of each of the grammar of

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.220
graphics very abstract principles as seen here as variables, and algebra,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.280
scales, statistics, geometry, coordinates, aesthetics, and our renderer.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.060
And even though you may think you're familiar with variables,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.513
in the context of the grammar of graphics this is slightly different than

00:00:20.513 --> 00:00:22.580
JavaScript variables for example.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.380
And while you may think you understand geometry and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.550
possibly have studied it in school, the geometry of the grammar of graphics

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.360
specifies is slightly different than the geometry many people are familiar with.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.500
Hopefully by tying each of these very abstract principles to associate d3

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.730
concepts, such as the d3 data loading, the d3 scale link.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.050
Appending rectangles, circles and lines and using CSS to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.010
style a graphic we can make the grammar of graphics theory much more concrete.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.610
Also, since d3 has a very chainable API this concept of a pipeline

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.379
fits very naturally with how d3 creates graphics to render on a webpage.
