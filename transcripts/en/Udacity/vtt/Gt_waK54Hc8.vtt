00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
The answer here is that there are 2 different shortest paths from A to B.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.850
Starting out at A you can either go up here, then down here, then up here, then down here,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.810
then up here, or you can go down here, up here, down here, up here, down here.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.480
There is no other possibility of getting from A to B while visiting all vertices

00:00:20.480 --> 99:59:59.000
and only taking up 7 edges.
