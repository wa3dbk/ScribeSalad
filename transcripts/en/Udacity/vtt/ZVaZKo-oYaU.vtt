00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.395
&gt;&gt; That was right, David. So note what happened.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:35.860
There were the contents of the working memory. Here were all the rules of

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.510
a level in the procedural part of the long-term memory. And so then,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.800
match the contents of the working memory with the antecedents of the various

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.890
productions. Depending on the match between the contents of the working memory,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.235
and the antecedents of the rules, some rules got activated,

00:00:54.235 --> 00:00:59.290
fired as some people say. Depending upon what rule got fired,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.510
that resulted in, perhaps, firing of additional rules. So as David said,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.260
if the rule number one got activated because the goal became intentionally walk

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.810
the batter, that then lead to the activation of rule number three,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.350
which was to select the intentional-walk operator. In this way,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.610
given the set of contents of the working memory and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.440
a mapping between those contents and the antecedents of the various production

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.370
rules that capture the procedure knowledge. Some rules get activated, and

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.920
this activation continues until sort cannot activate any additional rules.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.540
At that point, sort has given an answer, based on the consequence of a rule

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.060
that matches a motor action. Note that sort just provided an account of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.680
how the picture decided on a specific page, on a specific action.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.943
Note that, we're started with the goal of providing an account of

00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:06.120
how the pitcher selects on an action or how an AI agent selects on an action.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.140
So what is the account? Based on the goal and the percents, match them

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.610
with the antecedence of the rules that captured the procedural knowledge.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.750
And then, accept the consequent of some production that matches some motor

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.850
action from some precepts we have gone to some action.
