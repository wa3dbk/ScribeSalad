00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.500
In our high fives and smiles study, measuring smiles was an objective measure.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
That is, it's something that we can actually see and measure. However, we could

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.180
have also asked the fellow Udacians to rate their level of happiness when I

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.375
gave them a high five. In asking them to rate their happiness, we use a

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:22.030
self-report measure. And, this is a subjective measure. Now, I want to have

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.270
Susan here give you more examples of different objective and subject measures.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.110
Another type of objective measure is a physiological response. Heart rate is

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.730
one example of a physiological response, sweating is another physiological

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.170
measure. Physiological measures are also objective because we can quantify

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.390
those responses. For the heart rate, we can use pulse to determine heart rate.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.970
Sweating, we can measure temperature and we can also measure the galvanic skin

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.880
response. One problem with self-report measures is that we can't be sure

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.250
they're completely accurate. But that is the only we can get that information

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.640
is to ask the participant. Think that to Lorens reaction who tickles the snake.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.260
We could use different psychological measures to assess her response. We can

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.030
use an objective measure meaning we could watch her run away. We could also

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.540
look at her nervous laughter and that would be an objective measure. We could

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.020
also ask self report. Hey Loren, how did you feel when you saw that snake. A

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.130
physiological objective measure. We could have measured her heart rate, which

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.290
would have increased due to her fear response. We could have also measured her

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.210
sweating. Most psychological experiments try to get both objective and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.210
subjective measures.
