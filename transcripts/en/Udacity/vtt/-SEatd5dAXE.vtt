00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.010
What do we really want to do is, have the first picture appear at zero, zero

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.710
and have the next picture appear a little bit after the last X coordinate

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.720
of the first one. We could call getMaxX to get that last X coordinate, and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.530
then add a small value to it. This way they would be 10 pixels apart.
