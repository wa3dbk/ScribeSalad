00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.210
There is a concept of data race that

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.000
plays an important role in considering how we can

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.580
relax consistency. A data race occurs when there is

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.420
a data dependence between accesses that are on different

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.990
cores, and the accesses are not ordered by synchronization.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.700
So, for a data race to occur, we need

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.320
to really have one process rating and another writing

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.500
to the same variable. Or the other way around,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.378
or both of them writing. And, the

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:31.618
access on this different course are not ordered

00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:36.390
by synchronization. So, here's an example of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.113
a data race. A data race here exists

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:44.855
because really we can have this happen or in another execution this store might

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:51.150
occur before the load and thus, this can happen too. So this is a data race.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.250
In contrast, something like this, where we do load A, then a barrier, and this

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550
thread participates in that barrier, and then thus

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.325
store A, there is a data dependence between

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:06.270
accesses but, they are clearly order by synchronization.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.082
This one will happen before this one because

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:12.122
of the barrier synchronization, so there is no

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:16.279
data race here. Conceptually, our data race allows

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:18.807
any order of these operations and that

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:22.125
might change the outcome of the program, whereas

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:28.840
here we know what's going to happen. Then there is a concept of a data race free

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.740
program which is a program that cannot create

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.790
any data races in its execution. Pretty much

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.058
that program is considered to be well synchronized

00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:41.718
so that any accesses to data are correctly

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:45.518
ordered by synchronization, barriers, locks, flags,

00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:50.270
etcetera. A key property of data-race-free programs

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.990
is that they behave exactly the same as they would in sequential consistency,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.090
even if we run them in any relaxed consistency model. Why is that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.048
so? Well, because if your synchronization is

00:02:03.048 --> 00:02:06.844
implemented correctly, then your synchronization is going to

00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:11.881
create the right orderings for things, and then, there is no opportunity for the

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:16.050
re-orderings that might violate sequential consistencies. So

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.460
data-race-free program is actually sequentially consistent, even if

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.010
we run it on a machine that doesn't support sequential consistency as long as

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.800
synchronization is correctly implemented for that machine.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.355
But keep in mind that while your debugging

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:34.910
your programs, even if you intend them to

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.392
be data race free, they may not actually

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:42.450
be data race free. In which case, theoretically,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.430
anything can happen. So pretty much, while we

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.561
are debugging a program. To remove data races,

00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:50.838
the behavior of that program on a weekly

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:53.529
consistent system might be very weird and thus

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.450
is makes the bugging really, really difficult. So for

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.135
most programs that are correct, and that means

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:03.750
data-race-free, we can relax the consistency model. But

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.670
for the debugging it really helps if we

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.170
can support sequential consistency. So some processors actually

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.355
have support to flip between sequential consistency, or

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:16.150
some more relaxed consistency that gives us better

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.442
performance. So that when you're debugging, you can

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:22.574
use sequential consistency until you're reasonably sure that

00:03:22.574 --> 00:03:25.870
your program is working correctly and is data-race-free.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.787
At which point, we can run it on a

00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:31.195
weaker consistency model to benefit from the additional

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:34.550
re-ordering that the processor is now allowed to do.
