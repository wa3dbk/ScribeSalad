00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That's the parser, and I know we went really quick.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We didn't have time to go over a lot of the details.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you hadn't seen anything about parsing or languages before,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I may have been too fast for you and I apologize.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But part of the idea was to teach a little bit about language theory,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but more the idea was just to give you a tool

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and to show you how these tools are built and how you can use them.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Don't worry if you didn't get all the details of exactly how the parser works.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If you are interested, there's another course and there's some other documentation

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that you can read to get up to speed on it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But I just want to talk about one more thing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There's something that bothers me here, which is say is say we have an expression--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
one single expression that's really long--and we start parsing it this way.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We say let's go left to right. We'll do the first alternative first.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Parse the term, and it parses this big, big long term

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and then tries to parse a plus or minus, and it says, oops, I hit the end.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There's no more plus or minus. This alternative fails.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now I try the second alternative, and the second alternative says

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
start with a term and we go back and we parse this whole big term all over again.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We've doubled the amount of work, and it can be worse that that,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
because inside of each of these terms there's more little pieces,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we can be doubling each of those pieces work.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That seems really inefficient.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What we'd like to be able to do is fix up our parser so that once we've done this work

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we don't have to do it a second time in case this version fails.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Don't worry about doing the work of saying what if like 5 out of 6 of these got parsed,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
just worry about the individual atoms, and saying if I did the work of computing

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the tree for an individual atom. I don't want to have to repeat that twice.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The quiz question is can you go into here and modify this parse function

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
so that it has that property that it doesn't repeat the work twice.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Once it's done it once, it's asked to do it a second time, it doesn't repeat the computation.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It just does the computation once.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That may seem like a daunting task, but there is a solution that's really simple

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that you have the tools for to be able to solve.
