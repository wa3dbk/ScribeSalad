00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Congratulation for completing Unit 1 of our introduction to theoretical computer science.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.230
We have introduced a lot of essential concepts and tools and you have managed

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.730
to master them and now have them at your disposal.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.840
You know what a RAM. You know about O notation or big O notation.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.180
You know how to analyze algorithms and you've also learned to understand

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.800
three very, very important problems in computer science known as clique,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.050
independent set and vertex cover.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.330
And while discussing these problems, you've also learned about the important concepts of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.670
polynomial time algorithms, exponential time algorithms, and the connected concepts

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.770
of tractable problems and intractable problems.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.850
Having all of these concepts and tools at your disposal, you're ready to dive deeper

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.160
into figuring out if we can make Alice, Bob and Carol happy by finding out that their problems

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.780
are tractable or if we have to bring them bad news and show that their problems are intractable,

00:00:59.780 --> 99:59:59.000
but for now again congratulations.
