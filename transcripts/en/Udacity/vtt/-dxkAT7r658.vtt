00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.290
At this point, we've seen how
polynomials can be represented by their

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.190
values, as a set of distinct inputs, and

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.430
how multiplying polynomials is easy,
when they're represented in this way.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.680
The problem is that we're really
interested in the coefficients.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.730
Recall that the coefficients of
the two polynomials can represent

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.460
any two sequences that
we want to convolve.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.890
To exploit the speed of multiplying
in the value representation,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.500
therefore, we need an efficient way,
first to evaluate a polynomial

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.350
at some distinct set of input points,
and an efficient way to interpolate

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.110
back the result to
the coefficient representation.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.140
We'll focus on optimizing for quick
evaluation of the polynomials first.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.750
Our goal is to evaluate a polynomial
A of order N at N distinct points.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.710
Note that I've made the order
of the polynomial and

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.060
the number of points the same here.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.420
We can always pad
the coefficients with zeroes,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.160
effectively increasing the order,
and we can always add more points.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.470
So there's no loss of generality here.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.940
As you did the calculation for the
exercise, you may have taken advantage

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.440
of the fact that the input values were
arranged in positive and negative pairs.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.600
For higher order polynomials,
this advantage becomes even greater.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.940
All the even terms are the same for
x and negative x, and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.880
the odd terms are just
negatives of each other.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.720
With this in mind let's define
A sub e to be the polynomial whose

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.870
coefficients are the even coefficients
of the original polynomial A.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.320
And we'll define Ao to be
the polynomial whose coefficients

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.020
are the odd coefficients of
the original polynomial A.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.930
Then we can write A as
A sub e of x squared,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.110
plus x times A sub o of x squared.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.690
And we can get A of minus x just by
changing this one little sign here.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.370
And essentially we've found two
values for A for the price of one.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.220
More formally, let's say that
we choose x sub i such that

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.220
x of i is equal to negative
x of I plus N over two.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.470
Then we can compute the values of the
polynomial two at a time by computing

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.240
Ae and Ao at Xi squared and
then using them in these two equations.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.640
Overall we have changed
the problem from evaluating

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.340
a polynomial of order and
at end points to evaluating two

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.760
polynomials of order N over
two at N over two points.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.740
Plus doing the work of N more
additions and multiplications.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.990
This is good, but

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.960
at its best we've only reduced
the running time by a constant factor.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.780
We need to be able to apply
this strategy recursively

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.330
to change the asontonic running time.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.190
A set of points that would allow us to
do this would be very special indeed.
