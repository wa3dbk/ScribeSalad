So just to make life a little more complicated,

00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:06.683
let's recall that we talked about things like true positives.

00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:09.955
False positives and false negatives.

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:12.925
Notice I left out true negatives because Kate and

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:16.225
I couldn't quite agree what it would mean in this example.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:19.744
But we can generalize that these, these three words, these three expressions to

00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:22.805
a confusion matrix with more than two concepts positive and negative.

00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:26.769
We have seven different concepts, as in this example over here.

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.400
Tell me for the concept, Tony Blair.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.040
What you think is the number of true positives
