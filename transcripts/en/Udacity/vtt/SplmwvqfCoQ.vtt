00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.170
So how will this class work? Because you can do just about

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.290
anything with Salesforce, we spent a lot of time dreaming up the

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.540
different apps you could build. For example, we could've built an app

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.190
to manage airplane parts in a warehouse, or keep track of clients at

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.690
a hotel, or anything else really. But these are everyday use cases

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.700
that just don't excite the imagination. You're going to spend some time on

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.230
this and we wanted you to have fun. So we settled on

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.470
building an app that would let you manage a music festival. If you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.040
don't know what a music festival is or how

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.500
they work, don't worry. We'll teach you as we go.
