00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.120
So, I just talked about
the organization of concepts and

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.280
the relationship of
concepts with each other.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.330
We only come across this when we were
talking about background knowledge in

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.130
the previous lesson on
incremental concept learning.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.330
So we had a brick and a wedge.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.940
They were both subclasses of a block.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.060
In general, the organization of
concepts can be much more complex.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.190
So here is a set of concepts that
you're probably all familiar with.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.467
We have different kind of animals,
vertebrates, intervertebrates.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.666
Vertebrates themselves, can be of
different kinds, reptiles, birds,

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.009
mammals, and so on.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.350
And here are birds, which can be of
different kinds, eagles, bluebirds,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.650
and penguins,
like we saw in the previous slide.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.365
And generally,

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:42.690
organization of these concepts
can be a little more complicated.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.390
So this is a conceptual hierarchy
that I expect all of your family with

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.302
the animals of various kinds, water
breeds and in water breeds, for example.

00:00:51.302 --> 00:00:54.650
And vertebrates themselves can be
a different reptiles, but mammals and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.330
birds can be a different kinds, for
example, eagles, bluebirds and penguins.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.000
So these are classes, and
these are sub-classes and super classes.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.006
Now the advantage of this kind of
conceptual organization is that

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:13.580
I can start going in a top down way
establishing and refining each category.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.310
So you see an animal and
you're trying to decide

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.360
whether the animal is a bluebird or
an eagle or a penguin.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.620
And you may start, initially,
by saying well, is it a vertebrate?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.530
Then, is it a bird?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.050
And if it is a bird, then is it a eagle,
a bluebird, or penguin?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.113
When you and I do processing of
this kind, it might happen so

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:32.350
fast that we might not be aware of it.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.410
But, when we try to put an air-agent,
we have to make that processing very,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.780
very explicit.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.570
Even among humans, imagine for example,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.740
what happens when the scientist
discovers new kind of species.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.320
Then the scientist can begin from the
top and say, well, is it a vertebrate?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.920
Where exactly in this tree
should I put this species?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.030
Is it a bird?

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.080
Is it closer to eagle?

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.180
Should I put it closer to a bluebird,
and so on.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.120
So classification of this kind
often has a top down, establish,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.780
refine, establish,
refine connected to it.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.400
&gt;&gt; So one of the benefits of this
establish and refine approach is it

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.380
helps us figure out which variables
we need to actually key in on and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.680
focus in on.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.240
So for example,
we saw earlier that eagles are large,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.650
but bluebirds are small.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.120
So birds can come in different sizes.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.850
So if we are trying to establish whether
something is a bird, a reptile, or

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.642
a mamma, we know that mammals also come
in different sizes like tiny mice or

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:24.330
large elephants.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.618
So size doesn't really impact our
decision whether it's a reptile, bird,

00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:28.850
or mammal.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.620
But once we've established it's a bird,
and

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.530
we're trying to decide between eagle and
bluebird for example, we know that size

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.590
actually can be something that helps
us differentiate between to these two.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.740
So now we'll pay attention to
size as a variable that matters.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.250
&gt;&gt; So note that there are several
things going on here.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.770
On one side, there is knowledge of these
different classes, but there's also

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.720
organization of these different classes
in a hierarchical particular kind.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.125
This organization is very
powerful in some ways.

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.805
If knowledge is power,
so is organization.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:00.425
Organization too is power.

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:02.395
This organization provides power,

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:06.415
because this organization tells you what
the controller processing should be.

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:08.595
Establish one node, refine it.

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:10.305
Establish that node, refine it.
