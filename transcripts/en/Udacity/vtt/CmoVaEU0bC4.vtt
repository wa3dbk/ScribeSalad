Growing bigger brains definitely has its costs, including the need for more

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:10.769
food or energy to handle all the extra brain activity. Additionally, bigger

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.301
brains mean bigger heads, making childbirth far more painful. In humans, this

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.949
resulted in human beings, being born earlier before the head is so big that it

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.985
can't pass through the birth canal. Now of course there are benefits to having

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:29.690
a big brain like the ability to store more complex information and the ability

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.337
to think critically. Okay, let's go talk more to Greg about how our brains

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:36.799
evolved.
