So, we know that meditation is linked to overall feelings of well-being, but

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:10.208
does meditation only effect self reported changes in feelings? New research has

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:14.429
actually shown that meditation increases the growth of brain tissue in the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.428
areas that are important in emotional processing and attention. In this study,

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:24.460
half of the people were trained in meditation and engaged in meditation for

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.079
eight weeks. The other half were randomly assigned to the control group, and

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.388
they did not meditate. At the end of the study, the changes in brain tissue

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:38.448
were also associated with emotional well-being in those that meditated. This

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:42.107
nicely demonstrates how changes in our environment can change our brain. So,

00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:46.312
here's a question. Was the study I just talked about a correlational research

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:50.079
design or an experimental research design? Select one.
