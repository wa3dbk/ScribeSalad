00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.710
I'm sure by now this picture is very familiar

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.910
to you. Showing you the memory hierarchy going all the

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.162
way from the CPU to the virtual memory on

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:12.040
the disk. You have several levels of caches, of course,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.820
the TLB that holds address translations for you, virtual

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.100
to physical, and you have the main memory and then

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.190
the virtual memory on the disk. Now, caches are

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.660
physically tagged and so you don't need to do anything

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.000
special about them from the point of your virtualizing the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.170
memory hierarchy. The really thorny issue is handling virtual memory, namely

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.020
the virtual address to the physical memory mapping, which is the key

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.310
functionality of the memory management subsystem in any operating system.
