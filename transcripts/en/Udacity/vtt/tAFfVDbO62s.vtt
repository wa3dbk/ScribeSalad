00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.689
Now consider the relationship between
work, transfers, and execution time.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.040
Suppose the processor takes tau
time units to perform an operation.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.980
Thus, the time to perform just
the compute operations is tau times

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.530
the work, W.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.850
Next, let alpha be the amortized time to
move one word of data between slow and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.310
fast memory.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.960
Alpha has units of time per word.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.680
Then the time to execute Q
transfers is alpha times L times Q.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.830
Now let's assume perfect overlap
between data transfer and compute.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.010
Then the minimum time to execute
the program would be the maximum

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.380
of the time to compute, and
the time to move the data.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.940
Let's refactor this expression a little.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.350
This refactoring shows the execution
time relative to the ideal running time,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.630
which is just tau times W.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.070
It's ideal in the sense that it
assumes data movement is free.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.170
Now relative to this ideal computation
time, you need to pay a penalty.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.190
This communication or transfer
penalty is the price you pay for

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.740
having to move the data.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.060
Now this penalty has some structure.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.310
Let's start with the denominator
of the second argument.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.050
Why it's nothing more than
the algorithms computational intensity.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.880
Recall that intensity has
units of operations per word.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.480
Now what about the numerator?

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.940
The numerator is th time per word
divided by the time per operation.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.910
It's a ratio of parameters that
only depend on the machine.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.980
In the literature, it's sometimes
referred to as the machine's balance

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.810
point, or just machine balance.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.820
And just like intensity,
it has units of operations per word.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.560
In other words, this ratio tells you
how many operations can be executing in

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.450
the time that it takes
to move a word of data.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.510
Machine balance is kind of
a special parameters, so

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.180
let's replace it with a symbol,
capital B.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.900
That's B as in buzz.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.570
Okay, so what we have now
is a general formula for

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.460
the minimum possible execution time in
terms of the balance of the machine and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.660
the intensity of the algorithm.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.900
For completeness we could also
estimate the maximum time for

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.880
computation in this model.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.610
It's basically the sum
rather than the max.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.600
That's because if there's no overlap,
you have to pay for computation and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.470
communication one after the other.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.020
Okay, so we have a formula to
estimate the minimum execution time.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.460
Sometimes, rather than
asking about execution time,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.370
we'll ask about a certain
measure of performance.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.830
I'll denote that measure by R.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.840
Its numerator is tao times W star.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.100
In other words,
the best time in the pure RAM model.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.150
So what does dividing by T do?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.030
Why?
It gives you the following formula.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.040
It says the best possible value of
the normalized performance is W star

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.390
over W times the min of one and
intensity divided by balance.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.650
This measure of performance is
inversely proportional to time.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.910
Therefore higher values are better.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.270
Take a moment to ponder it as you'll
explore it in more depth momentarily.
