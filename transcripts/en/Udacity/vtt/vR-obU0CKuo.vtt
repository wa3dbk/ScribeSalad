00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.246
So let's take a look at the quiz solution. First off, you should be able to

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:07.975
define a key state array of 256 elements wide. Again, this represents the

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:12.487
potential key input from an ASCII keyboard. In addition to that, we already had

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:15.922
the key down event listener attached. You had to simply go through and add the

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:20.068
on key up one. To properly cache state into our array, the key down and the key

00:00:20.068 --> 00:00:23.844
up event handlers simply needed to use the key ID variable of the event input,

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:29.658
and set the state to either true or false. And then in the update function, as

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:32.950
we see, nothing really changed except dropping the beat.
