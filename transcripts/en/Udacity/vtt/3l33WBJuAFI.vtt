00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.570
So the speed of light is a constant. But

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.160
the important thing about variables in Python is that

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.330
they can vary. That's why they're called variables. Once

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.640
we define the variable, we can change the value.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.960
And then when we use that name again it

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.200
refers to the new value. So let's see that

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.255
in an interpreter. We could change the value of

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.044
cycles_per_second. Suppose we have a faster processor. Now we've upgraded,

00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:29.630
we've got a 2.8 Ghz processor. Now, that doesn't

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.500
affect the value of cycle distance. This was already computed

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.740
with the old cycles_per_second. We still get the result, 0.111.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.630
We'll compute it again. This time the value of cycles

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.940
per second is the new value since we changed

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.820
what cycles per second refers to. And now when we

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.216
print cycle_distance we see that the values changed. So we

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:52.011
have a faster processor the second time we print cycle_distance

00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:55.254
now we only have 0.107 meters, less than 0.11

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:58.560
centimeters per cycle. So what happens now that we

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.980
have assignment, the same expression can have different meanings

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.727
at different times we evaluate it. The value of the

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:07.566
speed of light divided by cycles per second depends

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.352
on what the current value of cycles per second is.

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:13.126
When we evaluate the first one, the value was

00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:16.703
2 billion 700 million, so we got a different result,

00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:20.095
which was the 0.111 result we got the first time.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:22.790
When we evaluate the same expression the second time, the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.530
result's different, because the value that cycles_per_second refers to is

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.950
different. And that's why we get the smaller cycle_distance the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.290
second time. So, let's see what's going on there and

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.160
make sure we understand assignment. So, suppose we have a

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.841
variable, days. And we'll initialize it to the value 7

00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.290
times 7. So what that does is introduce a name days.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.510
And it refers to a value, which is the result

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.533
of that expression. So it refers to the value 49, and

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.945
that means when we look at the name days, we

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:53.430
see what it refers to and we get the result, 49.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.890
If we do another assignment. Let's say we have one

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.100
less day. And in this case we'll assign 48 to days.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.625
Well, that's a new assignment. We already have a name days.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.840
It used to refer to 49. But after the new assignment,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.800
it's going to refer to this new value. Now

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.840
it's going to refer to the value 48. The

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.280
number 49 still exists, but days no longer refers

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.880
to it. Now days refers to 48. Where things

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.820
get more interesting is we can use variables in

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.380
their own assignment statements. So here we have an

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.680
assignment statement where we have the value days minus

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.840
1 and we assign that to days. So what

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.070
happens with that assignment? Well, we evaluate the right

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.020
side first. We look for the value of days

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.300
and we see that it refers to 48. We

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.160
compute days minus 1 and we get the value 47.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.210
Then we do the assignment that will assign to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.450
the variable days. So now the value days refers to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.780
the value 47, no longer refers to 48. So

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.080
we could keep doing that, if we did another statement,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.310
same exact one, that's going to change the value again.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.190
This time, the first time, the value days is 47,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.560
we'll subtract 1, we'll get the value 46. And then

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.890
we do the assignment, that'll change the value, so now

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.320
days refers to the value 46. So the important thing

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.040
to notice, this is not an equal symbol. This looks

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.320
like an equal symbol. If you studied algebra you would

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.620
think an equation like this looks like an equality, and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.010
there is no way to solve an equation like that.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.270
In Python and in most programming language, equal does not mean

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.670
equal. What equal means is assignment. You should really think of

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.810
it as an arrow. It's an arrow saying put whatever value

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.140
of the right side evaluates to, into the name on the

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.950
left side. We don't write it as an arrow in most

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.270
programming languages. There's some that do, just because an arrow is

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.730
harder to type, and lots of programs have lots of assignments.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.870
But you should think of the equal

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.710
sign as not meaning equal, it means assignment.
