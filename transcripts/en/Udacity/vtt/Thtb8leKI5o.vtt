00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.950
So now, let's look at differential operators for images.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.220
Recall, that we'd looked at how to do various types of efficient methods to

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.440
do processing on images, by taking a kernel and applying it to an image.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.130
Well, let's start to build on that concept, but now, actually,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.460
let's use it to be able to do things like differential calculations on images.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.670
So what we need, basically, is an operation that,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.200
when applied to an image, returns its derivatives.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.020
It would be a lot of fun if you can actually create these operators that

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.740
are like masks or kernels because we've already learned how to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.090
do things like convolution or cross correlation.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.930
And that would allows to now compute image gradients by

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.260
running operations like this.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.980
And of course, then we need to do is,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.950
threshold this gradient information to select images.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.490
We will remember this term again, how to to thresholding to get to edges.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.250
And we'll cover more of this in the next lecture,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.900
when we talk specifically about edges
