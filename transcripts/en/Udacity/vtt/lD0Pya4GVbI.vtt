00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.676
It turns out there are many ways to specify a square. 1 solution with triangles

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:09.168
is a bit brute force. What you do is you create 2 triangles independent of each

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:14.311
other. So these four lines of code give you a triangle that goes from index 0,

00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:19.654
1, and 2. These are the first 3 points, right here. And then you have a second

00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:24.950
triangle 3, 4, and 5. That are these 3 points. Now you'll notice there's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.880
duplication of points 2 and 3 and 5 and 0 and we can save space and time by

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.022
merging these. A more compact and efficient way to draw the square is to define

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:40.088
the 4 vertices needed and then define 2 triangle faces reusing these points. So

00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:45.483
for example, here we're reusing these points, 0 and 2 for this first triangle,

00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:50.418
and for this second triangle. It turns out that the 3JS library happens to

00:00:50.418 --> 00:00:54.984
support a 4 point face. So you could just use one face like this. That said, the

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:58.937
way that web GL, DirectX, and other low level APIs work is to define only

00:00:58.937 --> 00:01:03.371
triangles. When the 3JS library defines a 4 sided polygon this way, the

00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:07.932
quadrilateral is rendered by 2 triangles being sent to the GPU. If you happen to

00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:12.222
solve this exercise by drawing a single quadrilateral, that's great that you

00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:16.782
read the 3JS documentation, bonus points for you. But it's worth your while to

00:01:16.782 --> 00:01:19.713
try this exercise again using just triangles.
