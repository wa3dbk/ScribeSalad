I'll start with the jQuery object, the dollar sign, and I'll pass in the string,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.270
li, to grab a jQuery collection of all the list elements.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.490
I'll check my answer with console.log and I'll open up the console.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.730
You might see a lot of errors here like we're seeing here but don't worry,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.240
you can just pretty much ignore those.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.620
Up here, we can see the jQuery collection returned from line five of our

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.190
program, which, this is on line five.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.030
So, I will open it up, and we can see the DOM elements that we are expecting.
