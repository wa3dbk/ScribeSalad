00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is the first and the third are true.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For the first one we know that the size of r is equal to φ(n).

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That's the way the totient is defined.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's the number of positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That's exactly how we define r.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The second one is not true.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In order for this not to be true, it would mean that there is some element where a xi mod n

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is equal to axj mod n, but that's not the case, because a and n are relatively prime.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We know that these values must all be different.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The only way these could be equal is if xi is equal to xj.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That means that the sets are the same size, and this set contains numbers only up to n - 1.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This set also contains numbers from 1 to n - 1.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That's why we know that s actually contains the same elements as r.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It must be a permutation of r.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now we can use a similar idea to what we used in the proof for Fermat's little theorem.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We can take the product of these two sets.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Since we know the contain the same elements, we know their products are also equal.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Here is what we get: the Π(R) is equal to the xi's all multiplied together,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is equal to the Π(S), which is equal to these values all multiplied together.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We also know from this property that the number of terms is φ(n).

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That's true on both sides.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That means we can separate out the a's from the x's.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We're going to have a^φ(n) times all the x's--still equal to this product.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now we can do the division.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Removing the x's from both sides, we end up with exactly what we need,

00:01:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which is that 1 is congruent to a^φ(n) mod n for any a and n where a and n are relatively prime.
