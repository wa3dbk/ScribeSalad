00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.240
&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, what's the answer?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.869
&gt;&gt; Does he have spleentitis?

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.070
&gt;&gt; Yes, does he have spleentitis?

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.020
&gt;&gt; I don't think we know, for sure.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.570
&gt;&gt; Mm? What do mean by that?

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.690
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean. It's a noisy and probabilistic world right. So the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.100
test told us that things look like he has spleentitis and the test

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.180
is usually right. But the test is sometimes wrong and it can give

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.460
the wrong answer and that's really all we know, so we can't be sure.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.290
&gt;&gt; Okay but if you had to pick one. If you had to yes or

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.270
no, like our students they did when they took

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.990
the quiz. Which one would you pick? Yes or no.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.890
&gt;&gt; So, I guess C the pants. I would just say, yes because the

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.780
test says, yes but if I guess I was trying to be more precise, I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.740
may go through and work out the probability and I guess if it's more

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.700
likely to have than not to have, then I'd say and otherwise I'd say, no.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.970
&gt;&gt; Okay. So how would you go about doing that? Walk me through it.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.690
&gt;&gt; Based on the name of the quiz, I think I'd go with Bayes' Rule.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.980
&gt;&gt; Okay. So [LAUGH]

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.230
I like that. So Bayes' Rule, is everyone recall, is

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.970
the probability of the hypothesis given the data is equal to

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.870
the probability of the data given the hypothesis times the probability

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.702
of the hypothesis divided by the probability of the data. So,

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:02.970
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.980
&gt;&gt; Let's write all that out. So what is the probability of spleentitis,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.510
which I'm just going to write as an s. Given.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.028
&gt;&gt; We're making jokes about spleentitis, but we

00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:19.210
don't want that to be confused with splenitis,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.350
which is a real thing and probably not very

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.460
pleasant. So apologies to anyone out there with splenitis.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.040
But this is spleentitis, which is really totally different.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.720
&gt;&gt; Is splenitis a real thing?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.260
&gt;&gt; :Really what is it?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.660
&gt;&gt; Enlargement and inflammation in the spleen and the spleen as

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.110
a result of infection or possibly a parasite infestation or cysts.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.120
&gt;&gt; So what you're saying

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.720
is that's gross and we don't want to think about it. OK good so Woo okay, so the

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.390
probability of getting splentitis and again is a very rare thing and probably isn't even real.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.680
&gt;&gt; Totally, its totally different, its definitely not real

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.850
&gt;&gt; Yea definitely not. Given that we gotten a positive result and you say

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.330
that we should use Baye's rules so that would be in this case what?

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.170
&gt;&gt; So it's the same as

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.420
the probability of the positive result given that you have spleentitis.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.723
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:12.723 --> 00:02:15.620
&gt;&gt; Times the probability, the prior probability of having spleentitis.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.821
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:21.330
&gt;&gt; And I want to say normalize, but like

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.970
divided by the probability of a positive test result.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.180
&gt;&gt; And what would be, the probabili. The other option is that you

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.930
don't have spleentitis.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.893
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:33.893 --> 00:02:38.430
&gt;&gt; Even though you got a positive result. And that would be equal to?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.920
&gt;&gt; The probability of a positive result given you don't have spleentitis.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.550
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.690
&gt;&gt; Times the prior probability of not having spleentitis.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.780
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.940
&gt;&gt; Divided by the, again the same thing. The probability of the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.260
test results. So that's, those two things added together, needed to be one.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.140
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.630
But as you point out. If we just want to figure out which

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.820
one is bigger than the other. We don't actually have to know this.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.700
&gt;&gt; Hm, good point.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.990
&gt;&gt; So we can ignore it, okay. Okay, so, let's compute this. So, what

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.030
is in fact, the probability of me getting a plus, given that I have spleenitis?

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.790
&gt;&gt; Right. So it says in the setup, the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.780
test results correct positive 98% of the time. So,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.540
I, I think that's what it means. It means

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.160
that if you really do have it, it's going to

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
say that you have it with that probability.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.110
&gt;&gt; Okay, so That's just point nine eight. OK? And

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.400
that's times the prior probability of having spleentitis which is?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.784
&gt;&gt; .008.

00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:33.700
&gt;&gt; Right. .008.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.780
And what's that equal to?

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.114
&gt;&gt; It is equal to. 0.0078.

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:43.568
&gt;&gt; 0.00784.

00:03:43.568 --> 00:03:47.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, fine. We can do the same thing over here. So

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.870
what's the probability of getting a positive if you don't have spleentitis

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.780
&gt;&gt; So, the probability of a correct negative is 97%.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.790
That means if you really don't have it, it's going to

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.120
say you don't have it, so probability of positive result

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.073
given that you don't have it, that should be the 3%.

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:04.730
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Times the prior

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.309
probability of not having spleentitis which is?

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:11.757
&gt;&gt; .992. 1- .008.

00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:15.290
&gt;&gt; That's right, and that is equal to?

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.095
&gt;&gt; .02976

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:17.750
&gt;&gt; So, which number is bigger?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.880
&gt;&gt; The one that has the larger significant digit.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.010
&gt;&gt; Which one of those two is that?

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.720
&gt;&gt; I mean, obviously, the one that's bigger is the, you don't have it.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.110
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.180
So the answer would be no.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.533
&gt;&gt; And in fact the probability is almost 80%.

00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:34.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.610
&gt;&gt; Which is crazy. So, it's like, you go into the doctor, you've run a

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.860
test, the doctor says congratulations, you don't

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.510
have speentitis, because the test says you do.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.887
&gt;&gt; That's right. [LAUGH]

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:45.260
&gt;&gt; So, what does that tell you?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.900
&gt;&gt; That seems stupid.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.190
&gt;&gt; That does seem stupid, but what does

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.345
it tell you About Bayes' Rule. What is

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:51.240
Bayes' Rule capture. What is thing that make

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.270
the answer no, despite the fact, you have

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.010
a high reliability test that says yes.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.740
&gt;&gt; I. Okay. So I guess, I guess the way to

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.220
think about it is, a random person showing up in the

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.480
doctors office, is very unlikely to have this particular disease. And

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.210
even the tiny, little, small percentage probability that the test would give

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.170
a wrong answer is completely swamped by the fact that you

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.150
probably don't have the disease. But I guess this isn't really factoring

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.430
in the idea that, you know, presumably this lab test was

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.280
run for some other reason. There was some other evidence that there

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.460
was concern.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.450
&gt;&gt; Or the doctor just really wanted some

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.620
more money, because She needs a new boat.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know a lot of doctors.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.790
&gt;&gt; I do too.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.680
&gt;&gt; And most of them don't work like that.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah most, well most of them have PhD's not MD's. So, another

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.760
way of summarizing what you just said Michael, I think, is that priors matter.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.800
&gt;&gt; I want to say the thing that I got out of this is tests don't matter.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.560
&gt;&gt; Well, tests matter.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.050
&gt;&gt; Like what's the purpose of running a

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.950
test if if it's going to come back and say.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.870
Well it used to be that I was pretty sure you didn't

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.120
have it and now I am still pretty sure you don't have it.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.760
&gt;&gt; Well the point of running a test is

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.370
you run a test when you have a reason to

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.170
believe that the test might be useful. So what is

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.680
the one thing, if I could only change one thing

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.740
without getting completely ridiculous, whats the easy well, I

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.040
don't know whats easy, whats the easiest thing for me

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.030
to change about this setup. I have three numbers here.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.090
This one, this one and this one. What would be

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.270
the easiest number to change?

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.490
&gt;&gt; Well, in some sense none of the seem

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.320
that easy to change but I guess maybe what

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.160
you're trying to get me to say is that

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.450
if we look at a different population of people

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.740
then we can change that .008 number to something

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.190
else, like if we only give the test to

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.270
people who have other signs of spleentitis. Then then

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.660
it, it would probably be a much bigger number.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.330
&gt;&gt; Right, so changing the test, making the test better

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.110
might be hard, presumably you know, billion of dollars of

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.020
research have gone into that, but if you don't give the

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.050
test to people who you don't have any reason to believe

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.640
have Spleentitis, just walking off the street, as you put it,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.340
a random person walking off the street, then you can change

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.280
the priors, so some other evidence. That you might have splentitis

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.800
would lead the prior to change, and then the test would

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.870
suddenly be useful. So this, by the way, is an argument

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.140
for why you don't want to just require that everyone take

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.010
tests for certain things. Because if the prior probability is low, then

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.590
the test isn't very useful. On the other hand, as soon as

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.700
you have any reason to believe We have strong evidence that someone

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.120
might have some condition, then it makes sense to test them for it.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.120
&gt;&gt; So it's like a stop and frisk situation.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.570
&gt;&gt; It's exactly like a stop and frisk

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.590
situation. I'm looking at you [INAUDIBLE]. Okay But in

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.230
some sense, you're use of the word prior

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.330
is a little confusing there. So it's not that

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.160
we're changing the prior, it's that we're...we have

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.130
some additional evidence that we can factor in. And

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.570
I guess we can imagine that that's part

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.790
of the prior, but it seems like it's posterior.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does. And it, but... One way

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.850
to think about it, you actually, I think you

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.170
just captured it in what you just said, right?

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.990
Which is you can think of as a prior. Well,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.850
a prior to what? So it's your prior belief

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.560
over a set of hypotheses, given the world you happen

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.070
to be in. If you're in a world where

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.810
random people walk in to take a test for splentitis,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.320
then there's a low prior probability that they have it. If you're in a world

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.800
where the only people who come in are people who are from a population where

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.580
the prior probability is significantly higher, then

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.620
you would have a different prior. It's really

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.060
a question about where you are in

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.520
the process when you actually formulate your question.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.210
&gt;&gt; So would it be worth asking people how, how likely would it have to be

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.280
that you have spleentitis to make this test

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.990
at all useful? Right, that would change a

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.690
positive, a positive result would actually change

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.620
your mind about whether someone has it.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.660
&gt;&gt; yeah, actually that, I think that's something that I,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.790
I'll leave for the for the, for the interested reader,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.940
where would that prior probability have to change so that

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.880
getting a positive result, I would be more likely to believe

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.950
that you actually have it than not. That does bring

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.120
up a philosophical question, though, which is So what, just because

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.919
the priors have changed, doesn't mean that suddenly the test

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.030
is useful, or that the test is going to give you an

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.669
answer that somehow distinguishes and is this positive. And from

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.760
a mathematical point of view, the question of whether this

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.410
number is 0.008 or, or 0.8, you know, 8 10ths

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.922
of a percent, where does it change? Does it change

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:55.890
at 5%? Or does it change at 50%? Or does

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.210
it change at 500%? It probably changes at 500%. You

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.270
know, what, where is the place in which suddenly a

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.010
positive result would make you believe they actually had spleentitis or

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.780
whatever disease you're looking for. Okay?

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.
