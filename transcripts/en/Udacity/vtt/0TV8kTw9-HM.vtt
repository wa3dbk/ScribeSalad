00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.930
So I hope it's clear that the aggregation framework is

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.270
designed to allow you to create a data processing pipeline, as

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.270
we've seen several times. Now, you can include as many

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.750
stages as you need in order to achieve a goal. For

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.190
each stage, you just need to consider what input that

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.660
stage needs to receive and what output it needs to produce.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.230
Now, what I want to talk about here, is the fact that

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.370
many tasks require us to use more than one stage with

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.120
the same operator. For example, we frequently need multiple

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.650
group stages, in order to achieve our goal. So, let's

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.630
look at another example. This time I really want you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.460
to consider each stage individually and just think about the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.310
inputs and outputs. We're going to do a tweak

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.280
on our original question of user mentions. And this time

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.130
we're going to look at who has mentioned the most

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.550
unique users. So, in the same way that we looked

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.990
at unique hashtags just a minute ago, now

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.360
we're going to, look at modifying this pipeline

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.580
so that we're only counting mentions of users

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.519
not already accounted for in our grouping. So

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.760
here's the code for this. We have our same unwind stage as before, but the group

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.240
stage is different, and you'll notice that there's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.610
another unwind stage here and another group stage here.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.440
In the first group stage, what we're doing is,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.020
aggregating still on the user's screen name but, rather

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.460
than simply summing up all of the documents that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.200
this group stage received in order to calculate all the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.840
user mentions, because of course unwind is going to generate

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.190
one document for every user mention. Instead what we're

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.770
going to do here is use the addToSet operator

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.120
that we looked at just a couple minutes ago. Now,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.102
what we're paying attention to here is the

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.570
screen name for the user that was actually

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.040
mentioned in the tweet. So we're accumulating an

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.680
array here in this group stage of a unique

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.030
set of users mentioned in tweets produced by

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.090
this user, or by each user. Okay, but that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.070
doesn't get us what we want, because again

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.600
remember our question is, who has mentioned the most

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.880
unique users? Okay, so to this point, all we

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.510
have is a list of unique users. We haven't counted

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.500
them yet. Now in order to do that, what we're

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.910
going to need to do is think about what's the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.190
output from this group stage? Well, the output is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.990
going to be exactly what we defined here as the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.090
structure of documents coming out of this. All documents will

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.130
have an underscore id field. Which will be the username

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.290
that forms the basis for the grouping that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.720
that document represents. And there will be this

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.042
mset field, our mentions set. Okay? So this

00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:46.191
stage here, will receive documents with an underscore

00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:50.966
id field and an mset field. So, what that means is that we can use unwind

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:54.446
again here, and produce one document for every

00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:57.245
item in this array. And again remember this is

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.957
going to be an array of unique elements because we used the addToSet operator to

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:05.875
produce it. So unwind then will generate one document for every item found, in

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:11.590
the mset field where each document in its input. So this stage then,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.060
will unwind this array of unique user mentions and pass

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.550
those along to this second group stage. And it's this group stage where

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.050
we end up calculating the count that we want.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.070
So instead of just counting all user mentions as we

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.170
did before, here, instead what we're going to do,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.290
is now count those unique mentions that get passed along

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.680
to us here after unwinding the mset array. Okay?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.591
So the documents then to be passed along from this

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:44.502
second group stage to sort are going to contain an

00:03:44.502 --> 00:03:47.669
id. This is just a, copying over essentially of the

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.839
id that we got as input to this stage,

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.429
which, is going to be the id that is produced

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:55.670
here at this stage. And then we're simply counting

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.872
how many documents did I receive that have that id?

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:02.824
Or how many unique user mentions did I receive

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:06.510
for this specific user? Okay? Then we're simply going to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.020
sort based on the count field, in descending order as

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.530
we've been doing through most of our examples. And, finally,

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.170
here I'm going to limit it to ten so we can actually see what the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.290
counts are for unique user mentions for the

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.990
top ten tweeters. Okay. So, let's run this.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.700
Okay. So, we can see the names of the users,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.590
and their respective number of unique user mentions throughout this collection.
