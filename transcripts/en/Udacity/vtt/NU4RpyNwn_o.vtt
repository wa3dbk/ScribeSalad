00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.865
This first one y equals 3x squared plus 12x plus 20 is a quadratic function. And

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:12.945
the second, y equals 4x cubed minus 24x squared plus 35x is a cubic function.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:16.530
Now both of these names might remind you of some stuff that you learned during

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.114
our polynomial section at the beginning of the course and that makes perfect

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:24.288
sense. The names of these types of functions refer to the degree of either one

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:29.300
of them. So cubic refers to the fact that this is of degree 3, and quadratic

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.183
refers to the fact that this is of degree 2.
