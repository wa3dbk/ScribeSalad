00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.980
The Android griddle plug in creates
a set of configurations for

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.120
each build variant.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.540
This allows us to manage dependencies
independently for each of our variants.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.140
So we'll have the usual compile and
run time configurations.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.570
But we'll also have free compile and
free runtime.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.510
And so on.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.090
The free runtime configuration extends
the free compile configuration.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.860
Just as compile extends runtime
when using the Java plugin.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.270
Additionally, free compile configuration
extends the regular compile

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.470
configuration.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.060
Which means our free variance will
include all of our default dependencies.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.390
In addition to those added
to the free configurations.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.630
It's probably likely that we would
want to enable ads in the free version

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.120
of our app, but not in the paid.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.440
Utilizing Google's Ad Services requires
to depend on the Ad Services Library.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.910
However we don't want to unnecessarily
bloat the paid version of our app

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.200
by including a library
that won't be needed.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.450
To solve this problem we can simply
declare this dependency only for

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.550
the free version of our app.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.540
As you can see here,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.770
we've added a dependency to
the Google Play ad services.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.620
But we've assigned it to
the free compile configuration.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.640
That's really there is to declaring
variant specific dependencies.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.830
But we've included a demo
in the course repository.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.440
You should check it out.
