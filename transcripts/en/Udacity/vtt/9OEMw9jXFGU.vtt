00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.912
This hypotenuse here would be 40 units in length. Great job if you've found

00:00:04.912 --> 00:00:08.807
this number. Remember, these are the legs of the triangle, since they form the

00:00:08.807 --> 00:00:14.000
90 degree angle. The side across from the 90 degree angle, this side is called

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.930
the hypoteneuse. We don't know the length of the hypoteneuse, so we'll call it

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.584
x. We'll start with our Pathagorean Theorem and we'll plug in the numbers for

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:28.845
the legs here and then hypotenuse here. So, we'll have 32 squared plus 24

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:33.948
squared equals x squared. We'll square each of these numbers and then we'll

00:00:33.948 --> 00:00:39.670
have these two added together equals x squared. This gives us 1600 equals x

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.602
squared. Now we want to take the square root of both sides of the equation to

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:47.467
solve for x. When we take the square root, we'll need to include the plus or

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:51.860
minus symbol. But, in this case, since the distance is positive, we can

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.860
disregard the negative root. We only want the positive root. This gives us x

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.630
equals 40, or 40 units in length. Now, there's another way to solve this

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.132
problem. And it involves a 3, 4, 5 right triangle. This is one of our special

00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:13.095
triangles. For our special right triangle, the side links are the ratio of 3 to

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:17.630
4 to 5. It turns out the side lengths of this triangle are in the same exact

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.628
ratio. We know that the legs are 24 and 32. So, I'm going to put those here. If

00:01:23.628 --> 00:01:30.279
we multiply this leg by eight, we would end up with 24. And if we multiply this

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:35.070
leg by eight, we would wind up with 32. So, we can see that eight would be the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.060
multiplier for this ratio. So, to get the side length of a hypotenuse of this

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.530
triangle we would just need to multiple 5 by 8. This is another way without

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.375
using the Pythagorean Theorem that we can find this hypotenuse.
