00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So another kind of big classic questions I've been 
seeing in the forum's lecture is hosting.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Specifically people want to know if you're not using 
Google App Engine, what else should I do?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Or why should you use Google App 
Engine instead of the alternatives.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So let's talk about each of those. The first 
option is to run your website locally.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And this basically means run this out of a machine 
that's in your house, or in your dorm room,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or it's your everyday computer--the same 
machine you might be developing,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which works fine for this class.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Basically, the website doesn't 
have to be on all the time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It just has to be on while your submitting 
your homeworks and that's it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For almost every other use case, 
it doesn't really make sense.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Some of the big drawbacks are--it's not always on.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The Internet doesn't go to sleep 
neither should your website.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's not always accessible. By that, I mean your 
Internet may be broken or power goes down.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There's lots of--you're running in the house. 
It's not a data center.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So there's lots of things that can go wrong. 
Your IP may change.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Depending on your hosting provider, you may 
need to pay extra for what's called a static IP,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and this is an IP that you have to 
pay extra for so your IP address.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Basically, the location of your machine 
on the Internet doesn't change.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Because you want to have a name 
for your website--domain name--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and that domain matches to an IP.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If your IP changes all the time, which it does with 
most Internet connections, it won't work out.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now there's technologies to work around this 
but probably won't have a static IP.
