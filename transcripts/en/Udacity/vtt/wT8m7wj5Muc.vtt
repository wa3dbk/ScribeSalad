[Norvig] Now, I said that with the correct shuffle algorithm,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the Algorithm P, every permutation of the deck has an equal probability.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The next question is, for the teacher's algorithm

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
does every permutation have an equal chance? What do you think?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yes, they're all the same, it just takes longer to get them;

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
no, some of them will be different, have a different probability;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or no, some will have a 0 probability,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that there will be some permutations that it's impossible for the teacher's shuffle to generate.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Tell me which you think.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is a hard question. It takes some analysis to be able to figure it out.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You may be able to tell just by looking at the algorithm,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or you may want to write some code to analyze what the situation is.
