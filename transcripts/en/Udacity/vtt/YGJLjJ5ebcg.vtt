00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.300
Another option is this kind of manage posting.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.780
This kind of industry is changing right now.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.540
It used to be the case just a few years ago that you would rent machines from

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.170
a data center, like, these machines would already be installed and

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.440
configured and you could just, you know, rent five of them.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.530
Could do all of this online.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.050
And the industry's changed a little bit.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.320
This is kind of new system of dealing with this which is basically kind of

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.700
this match hosting cloud set up.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.240
And that's, that's what I'm going to focus on here,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.600
because the kind of in between guys aren't nearly as popular as they used to be.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.790
So these are players like AWS.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.790
Rackspace, Linode, I think, kind of does this sort of thing.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.280
They're all those, these are the ones I've hear of.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.320
Reddit and Hitmonth both use AWS, it's my personal favorite.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.650
Generally the idea is you are renting machines.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.850
In the case of Amazon, I can't speak for others, you rent machines by the hour.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.100
So we pay $.10 an hour or something for our machines on Amazon.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.060
You don't have to think too much about bandwidth and power.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.220
You don't think about power at all.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.610
Bandwidth you generally pay some amount for.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.660
You can install the operating system if you want.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.100
More likely you're just configuring the OS, not installing it.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.560
You're in the system where your machines can just kind of disappear.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.400
If your machines fail, the hosts may bring up a new machine for you or

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.240
they may notify you or you can write scripts to automate this whole thing.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.750
This is the area where I like to live personally.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.930
Still get control over your machines in the sense that you can,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.490
you know exactly what software is installed, what versions are installed,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.990
what kernel is installed, all of that stuff.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.390
But you don't have to deal with actually installing this machines in a rack and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.580
replacing them by hand and doing the physical work.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.360
It's all virtual.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.790
I've never seen the service that host Reddit and Hitmonth.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.815
With Reddit we started out renting a few machines from this manage

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:27.870
hostings provider, kind of pre-Amazon pre-Rackspace seven years ago.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.860
Then we started co-locating our own machines and then when Amazon,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.060
AWS, Amazon Web Services came out, that's when Reddit switched to Amazon.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.260
In the office, in the Reddit office,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.530
there's a bunch of physical machines sitting under a desk that used to

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.250
actually run Reddit.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.630
20, 30 machines, whatever there were.
