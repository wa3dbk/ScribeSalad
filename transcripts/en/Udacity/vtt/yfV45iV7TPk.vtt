00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.260
So when solving radical equations, sometimes we'll get a quadratic with two

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.532
potential solutions. But we need to check these solutions in order to determine

00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:15.088
which ones actually satisfy the original equation. In this case, negative 1 did

00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:21.334
not check, so our only solution for this original radical equation is 5. This

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:22.620
is our solution set.
