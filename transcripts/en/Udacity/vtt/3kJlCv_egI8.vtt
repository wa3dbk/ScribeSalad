00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.300
Well that was generalization.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.670
Even trickier than generalization is figuring out how to implement associations.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.330
OO programming languages do not directly support associations so the OO

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.410
design process must choose the best means of implementing these associations.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.710
Some of the factors you have to take into account, first off is directionality.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.720
What this means is, if your program is going to need to interact with several

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.229
classes, is the direction of that interaction always in one particular way?

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.100
First A and then B or might you go in either way.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740
Second is cardinality.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.560
That is for

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.370
particular instance of one class are there multiple instances in another class?

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.970
And third is the kind of access you will make into classes.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.160
Sometimes these are called the CRUD properties.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.095
Where C stands for create, that is how you going to create instances, R is for

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:56.310
read, that means are you just going to query or access the, the instances,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.390
U is for update, that is, could you change the instances and D is for delete.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.500
Depending on, which of these particular kinds of accesses and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.040
how frequently they occur, it might particularly in

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.440
the performance area effect how you choose to implement them.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.870
And finally as far as invariant maintenance is concerned,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.970
okay associations often have invariance associated with them.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.250
Like referential integrity constraints and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850
it's up to you as the designer and programmer,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.340
to build your program in such a way that these invariants are maintained
