00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.791
The next topic I want to talk about is voting.

00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:06.070
Voting involves lots of cryptographic issues

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.256
and there are many interesting security

00:00:08.256 --> 00:00:09.822
properties that a voting system should

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:11.970
provide. One property that many voting

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.070
systems desire to provide is anonymity that

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.854
it shouldn’t be possible for an adversary to

00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:21.221
know who someone voted for. The other

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.487
property a voting system should have is that

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:26.052
the count is verifiable. These are shorter

00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:28.106
than opposition. Verifying the count would

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:30.493
be easy as each voter would be willing to

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:32.491
publicly declare their vote and someone

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.195
could look at all of those votes. But if you

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:37.104
want to keep the votes anonymous and

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.438
have a notion of private ballot, well then

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:42.451
verifying the count becomes more challenging.

00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:45.004
Another property some voting systems want to provide

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.584
is coercion-resistance. What this really means is that a

00:00:47.584 --> 00:00:51.219
voter can't prove who they voted for if votes are secret

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.486
and there is no way to prove for whom one votes, well

00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:57.736
then, there is no way to coerce the voter into voting a

00:00:57.736 --> 00:01:00.224
particular way.

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:04.146
And then we have all the usual goals of reliability

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:07.986
and security. These things are hard to achieve.

00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:09.686
There are good ways to achieve them with

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:13.289
paper ballots if we have trusted ballot boxes

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.704
guarded by trusted election officials and if we

00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:19.021
have enough trusted third-parties, well maybe

00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.421
we can trust them to report the right tally.

00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:22.792
We’re going to look at one interesting cryptographic

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:26.392
way to do voting, but I want to emphasize that this is

00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:29.544
not a solution to the real problems that are

00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:32.775
necessary to running election. But it solves this

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:35.175
issue of can you keep votes anonymous and still

00:01:35.175 --> 00:01:37.864
have a way to verify that the count is correct.
