00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, this is a lot of boxes to check for one quiz

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but I don't think it's that hard to think about so let's go through this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In a clique, each node is connected to each of the other nodes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the degree is linear in the number of nodes but think about path links.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Every node is connected to every other node.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So the path you can always get directly from one node to any other node.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
A very, very small world but it's a small world because everybody knows everybody.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And we know that that's not what our world is like.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now if you go to a small private school you may have exhibit exactly this kind of effect.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
All right, next let's think about a ring. What happens in a ring?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, the degree in a ring is always 2. All the nodes have a degree of 2.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So it's a constant degree, but what about a path link? What's the longest path link in a ring?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, some of the nodes are really nearby but some of them you have to go all the way

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to the other side to get to them and that could be as big as the number of nodes N

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
divided by 2 because it's the opposite side.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
After you get further and further and further, you start to get closer again.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So the path link is actually linear in this case. Balanced tree is really interesting.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So the degree here, well a node might have a parent and two children.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This is a balanced binary tree in particular.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The root node has a degree of 2 and all the leaves have a degree of 1, so it's never more than 3.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
No matter how many nodes were in the graphs so the degree is constant.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But let's look at the path link.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Any node can get to any other node by going up to the root

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and then back down to the other node you want to get to.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Getting up to the root takes logarithmically not many steps.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And then going back down also takes logarithmically not many steps.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So it's like two log n but that's actually a pretty short path for a big graph.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's not that many hops you have to make to get to where you're going.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
All right finally let's look at our friend the hypercube.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In a hypercube, each node is numbered with log n bits and it's connected to all the other

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
nodes in the network that have names that differ by at most one bit.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
There's at most logarithmically many of those.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So each node in the hypercube is connected to log n and other nodes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The degree is a big data of log n.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now what about path link. If I want to get from one node to any other node, what do I need to do?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So we didn't talk about this before but it's actually kind of neat.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So let's imagine we want to get from some node and here's its label 010

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to some other node and here's its label 111.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We know in one hop we can go from 010 to 110.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And then in one more hop we can go from 110 to 111.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
In fact, to go from any node in the hypercube to any other node in the hypercube,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
all you have to do is go through the bit positions one at a time and to reverse

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the corresponding edge if the source and the target differ in that bit position.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So in at most log n hops we can go from any position in this hypercube to any other position.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So again pretty short paths.
