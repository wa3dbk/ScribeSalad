00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I here with Carson Knowle from Security Research Labs in Berlin.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Carson has done a lot of interesting work on breaking real-world cryptosystems,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
including the GSM cryptosystem that's used to protect many mobile calls and SMS messages.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He's going to give us a little demo of that and then explain how it works.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd like to start with a motivating example of where this has been applied,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
cracking mobile phones--the 2G part of the phones we still use.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Every phone today is still a 2G phone in some way,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
even though 3G and 4G now have been added to it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Breaking this, of course, allows you to snoop in on messages, phone calls,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
may allow you to put charges on somebody else's phones,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and may allow you to track them, for instance, right?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can certainly get in a lot of trouble for misusing those powers.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Yes, and we certainly want to stay away from that today,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
which is why we're only breaking this phone, my phone.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The demo I want to show is intercepting a text message sent to this phone.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's something that is delivered to the phone in an encrypted form--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
an encryption function from 20 years ago, but some of these are still solild.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
DES, for instance--TripleDES anyway.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
However, this one turns out to be weak and how weak we'll show now.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
For this I need a way of intercepting the phone communication with another phone.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Of course, every phone can record phone traffic.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Usually, they'll record traffic sent to their own number.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
If you slightly reprogram it, it'll just record traffic sent to any number

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
or whatever number you specify.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
To stay in the legal side, we'll make it just intercept traffic off this one other phone today.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This and a little bit of theory that you'll learn today is all that's needed to intercept a text message.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Okay. You see these blue lines?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
These are all attempts of the cell to reach phones for whatever reason.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Those are--we don't want to intercept them.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now you see the red lines. This is when it started sending data to the right phone.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The one where we gave it--

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So you set this up only to look at data that's sent to that particular number. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Right.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We could have put any number or just left it out to intercept it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That would put us on the wrong side of the law.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You see after just over 2 seconds, it found the correct key.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It also would show the from number. We blanked this out here.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It did come from England though. Interesting service you're using there.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And, of course, the texter of the SMS--the actual secret.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
All of this can be cracked in less than 3 seconds, apparently.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
While we are on this data, let me briefly show you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
what actually was exchanged between the phones, which will be interesting later

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to see why this was crackable.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In particular, we'll ask the question, why was this predictable in parts.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Some of the messages that you're intercepting you need to be able to guess what they are.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
That's ciphering, which is the old word for starred encryption.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Then everything below here is encrypted.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Now, a lot of this shouldn't be encrypted, at least it's not secret.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
For instance, the GPRS data connection list switched off.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
While you're receiving an SMS, apparently this phone is not supposed

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to also do data connections for just 1 second.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Then the cell introduces itself, saying I am the cell that uses all of these frequencies.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It did that as well before. You see up here the exact same message but unencrypted.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Here's the borderline. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;So these messages are very predictable.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Very predictable given one's encrypted and one's not.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Then the phone responds, hey, I measured our communication,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and I measured you to be this far away.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
This is for tweaking certain parameters--also not very secret,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
because probably the measurement report didn't change much from before the encryption.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
He goes on to exchange a few empty packets.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
In JSM you have to say something in certain time slots,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and if you have nothing to say then you say you have nothing to say. Exactly.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
These are just empty.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Again it measures. Again, empty, empty, empty, empty.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And again, the cell introduces itself and again it measures.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And again an empty and an empty frame.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And only now the actual SMS is exchanged.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
The from number with the text--I won't go into it so we don't see the from number.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The phone acknowledges the message as being received.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
These are the only two messages that I actually really needed.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Only one of them should really be encrypted.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
This cell, again, introduces itself as if the connection wasn't over yet.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And again, the phone measures. There's a couple more empty messages.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The cell says, "Please stop using this channel. We are done."

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Just in case the phone hasn't gone away yet, sends more empty encrypted messages.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now, this is all the decrypted traffic after you've decrypted it,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
but before decrypting it you've got a pretty good guess of what was in it

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
other than that one frame with the message.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Precisely, each predictable message gives us some attack surface

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that we can exploit using methods that we want to discuss next.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Great, well, let's hear about how you actually explain that.
