00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.300
Now that we know what the purpose of the
cache is, and how big approximately it

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.240
needs to be, let's look at how
it is organized internally.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.630
The question we need to ask ourselves is
how do we determine if we have a hit or

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
miss, so we need to know what
data do we have in the cache and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.510
then when the processor gives us
an address, we need to determine whether

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.580
that data is or is not in the cache and
we need to do that very quickly.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.910
And the other important question is,
how do we determine

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.500
what to kick out from the cache,
once we are out of room in it, and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.390
we need to put more stuff in it,
because we are just having a cache miss.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.860
So, for the first question of, how do we
know whether we have a hit or a miss.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.889
We want something that is very fast.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.050
That means it needs to be a table of
some sort that we can quickly index

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.900
with some bits of the address and it
tells us what we have in the cache and

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.140
if we do have what we are looking for
then it gives us the data.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.500
So conceptually, the cache is a table

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.610
which we index with some bits that we
take from the address of the data.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.770
So some stuff here needs to tell
us whether we have a hit and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.340
the rest of the stuff here is the data
we want if we do have the hit.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.380
How much data we have in each cache
entry is called the block size or

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.940
the line size, because the entry in
the cache is also called a line and

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.330
they tell us how many bytes
are in each of these entries.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.140
If we have only one byte per entry,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.340
then every address will map
to different to entries.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.970
If you have a block size of one,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.050
that means the entry in
the cache is only one byte.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.430
Every single byte address
will have a different entry.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.510
That creates several problems.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.150
One, usually the processor can issue
accesses not only to a single byte, but

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.490
also for example, loadward and storeward
will access a four byte location.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.860
So for a single access,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.040
now we would need to look up four
different lines in the cache.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.730
That complicates and
slows down the cache a lot, so

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.960
we definitely don't want
the block size to be this small.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.660
We want the block size to be at
least as large as the largest

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.410
single access that we
can do in the cache.

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:15.037
And hopefully slightly larger then that,
just so that when we do a loadward or

00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:18.560
storeward we find the data in the same
cache block most of the time.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.780
The next thing that we want to
consider when deciding the block size,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.080
is spatial locality.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.640
If we miss in the cache on one axis,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.080
we will bring in an entire block
worth of memory stuff into the cache.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.720
So if there is no spacial locality,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.690
we want to bring in just what
we are currently accessing.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.170
But if there is any spacial locality,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.930
we want to bring more than
what we are just accessing.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.470
So typically, block sizes of
32 to 128 bytes work well,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.430
both from the perspective of their
larger than a typical access.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.960
And also they capture much of the
spacial locality that exist in programs.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.050
Now let's look at block sizes of
something like 1KB, in that case

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.150
what happens is we fetch a lot of data
from memory every time we have a miss,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.350
and if there is not enough locality
a lot of the data will not be used, so

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.970
we are occupying space in our cache.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.120
Remember that the cache is only
16 to 64 of these kilobytes.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.990
So if we bring in a block like this,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.460
we are consuming a significant part
of the overall space in the cache.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.400
And we are doing it probably with
data that we won't use much.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.230
So it turns out that for
level one caches at least,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.140
we don't want the block
size to be too large.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.290
So block sizes of 32 to 128
kilobytes are a balance between

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.010
getting use of spacial locality
when we bring stuff in,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.650
versus not being dependent
too much on there being

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.130
a lot of spacial locality because some
programs don't have that much of it.
