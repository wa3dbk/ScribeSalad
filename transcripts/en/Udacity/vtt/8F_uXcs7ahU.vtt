00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.150
But as soon as we write any code that relies on the differences that

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.280
exist between a regular car and a cop car, then we have a bit of a problem.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.360
We can't really add a cal method to every car instance because we don't

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.450
really think that non-cop cars deserve that method.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.550
One naive solution would be to copy all of the code from the car class into

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.860
a second class and then re-factor it.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.930
We'd probably give the two functions different names to reflect that they

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.640
are different classes.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.830
Then in each function, we would add the code that would make that particular

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.910
class different from the other.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.550
In this case,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.760
imagine that the grab method is something only vans should be able to do

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.100
because it's the way in which the van is going to be able to attack the player.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.610
By contrast, this cal method is something that's only available to cops.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.660
Because it represents the way in which the player can get access to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.190
help from a cop.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.800
In this scenario we would have two different constructor functions that both

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
produced objects that were basically identical with the exception of this new

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630
method, either grab or cal.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.960
This solution works.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.770
But as you can see, there's a lot of duplicated code here.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.450
Let's look for a solution that allows us to reuse that code,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.489
rather than type it twice
