00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.359
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.010
&gt;&gt; So
it looks like the brick on the bottom

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.440
supports the two bricks in the middle.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.550
So this brick supports those two bricks.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.850
And then those two bricks
support the brick on the top.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.140
So those two bricks each
support that top brick.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.270
Note that we've not yet

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.470
got an example that tells us whether
these links are required or not.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.100
So that's why these are supports and

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.220
not must support,
as we saw in our concept last time.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;&gt; Now we'll give you some more
examples, some positive, some negative.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.610
And we'll ask you how the air
agent will go about refining it's

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.470
concept definition.
