00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.739
So let's recreate our programming model diagram.

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:05.141
We've got threads, and we've got thread blocks.

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:07.585
And really what is happening with these barriers

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:12.307
is that the sync threads call is creating a barrier within a thread block.

00:00:12.307 --> 00:00:15.544
So all the threads within this thread block are going to get to this sync threads call,

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:18.328
stop, and wait until they've all arrived and then proceed.

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:22.389
And these thread blocks are organized in kernels; every kernel has a bunch of thread blocks.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:27.513
We haven't talked about this really, but there's an implicit barrier between kernels.

00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:30.771
So if I launch 2 kernels, one after another,

00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:35.402
then by default kernel a will finish before kernel b is allowed to start.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:39.042
So all of these threads will complete before any of these threads get launched.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.642
So when you add in our memory model that we've talked about,

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.282
where every thread has access to its own local memory,

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:49.184
to its block shared memory, and to the global memory shared by all threads and all kernels in the system,

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:51.520
then what you've got is CUDA.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.500
At its heart, CUDA is a hierarchy of computation.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.767
That would the threads, thread blocks, and kernels

00:00:56.767 --> 00:01:00.294
with the corresponding hierarchy of memory spaces: local, shared, and global,

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.866
and synchronization primitives:

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:06.866
sync threads, barriers, and the implicit barrier in between 2 synchronous kernels.
