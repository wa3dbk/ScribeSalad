00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:07.266
So let's have a look. What about x1? So here we have x1, not x1, not x1 and x1.

00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:10.232
I have no idea what to do with that, so it's probably not easy.

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:17.699
What about x2? So here we have x2, x2, not x2, still kind of difficult to see if we should set it to false,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.566
making this clause here satisfied or if we should set it to true, satisfying those two clauses up here.

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:27.932
It's not easy, or at least it's not doable without playing around with other true or false assignment.

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:36.932
What about x3, same case? So here we have x3, not x3, x3, again, x3, not x3, no idea what to do with that.

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:43.899
So all that remains is x4. Now, where does x4 appear? X4 appears here and x4 appears here.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:51.066
And what you'll notice is that both time we have not x4. So x4 could appear in two forms, right?

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:57.766
So x4 could appear as x4, or as not x4. But we have just this one form appearing.

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:02.966
And this goes back to the answer of the previous quiz, where I gave you an intuition for what makes SAT hard.

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:09.866
What makes SAT hard is that, if you choose a truth assignment of true or false, then some clauses obviously

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:15.099
become satisfied, but in other clauses you get less variables to satisfy that clause.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.732
However, if you have a variable that just appears in one form, then you don't have that dilemma.

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:29.166
It's always clear that we should set x4, which is the correct answer here, to false, because then we satisfy this clause here,

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:35.632
we satisfy this clause here, but there are no secondary effects again. So all of the other clauses are unaffected by

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:42.299
how we set x4. So we just choose it to our advantage. And of course, also, this is something that is easy to do algorithmically.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.366
So for each of the variables that appear in a Boolean formula, an algorithm could just go through

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:51.932
and see if that variable appears in both forms--so as the variable itself and in the "not" form.

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:58.099
And if it appears just in one form, then we already know how to set it. So we have now found a third pre-processing rule for SAT.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.233
Now, let's step back a little bit and look at the general requirements of pre-processing.
