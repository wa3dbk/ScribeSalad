00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.870
And here's a map in addition to showing the globe has plotted

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.720
circles on the map to show the relative distortion at different latitudes.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.480
As you can see here, as you go south and north, the distortion increases.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.390
And it's a bit subtle, but the distortion going from

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.330
circle one to two is much less than going from two to three.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.770
So there's not equal distortion going from the equator, North.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.360
But it does it's best as close to the equator as it can, to preserve area.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.700
And once you get far, far North.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.810
The Mercator projection is much more lenient in its distortions.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.680
One thing of note is that the Mercator projection actually preserves area

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.870
across a latitude line.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.460
So even if you are very North, going across the same latitude line,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.190
all the circles are equally as distorted.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.210
If you've ever wondered why Alaska looks about as big as

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.940
the entire United States, and Greenland looks bigger than Africa,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.000
it's simply because the Mercator projection vastly distorts countries or area so

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.150
far North and South of the equator, and is often one of the most ubiquitous map

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.260
projections you see out there, regardless of this distortion effect.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.380
But for our purposes, we're interested in countries in the middle region.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.630
One, because they're the participating countries in the World Cup and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.410
most frequently participating and two, the locations near the center of

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.660
the map are the ones where the World Cup's actually been held.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.040
So let's return to our code and start drawing.
