00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.668
We have two major areas of mental illness to cover, and those are personality

00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:08.890
disorders and schizophrenia. So, let's start with personality disorders.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.616
Personality disorders are another area where psychologists disagree, and their

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:17.704
classification in the DSM has been controversial. For example, some have

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:21.232
suggested that we look at these personality problems as extreme values on a

00:00:21.232 --> 00:00:24.648
trait dimension such as the big five that we learned about in our lesson on

00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:31.518
personality, and not call them a disorder. Approximately 15% of the general

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:36.995
population of people over the age of 18 have a personality disorder. But if you

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:41.195
look at the age range from 18 to 25, approximately 20% have a personality

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:46.710
disorder. Now let's go back to Lauren and learn a little bit more about this.
