00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.298
So now we have our formal measurement for the f statistic. Which signals

00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:09.852
whether or not there is a significant difference between any two sample means,

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:16.250
out of k samples. We can write this as the sum of squares for between groups.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.319
Divided by the degrees of freedom for between groups. Divided by the sum of

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:25.790
squares for within groups. Divided by the degrees of freedom for within groups.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.028
This gives us what we call the mean square. And this ratio is our f statistic.
