00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.710
Beyond the model, you need a pseudocode
notation for formalizing algorithms.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.220
So let's start with our traditional
sequential pseudocode notation and

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.610
let's make the following changes.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.300
First we'll write our algorithms
assuming a single-program,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.775
multiple data style.

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:22.980
HPC nerds refer to this as S-P-M-D or
SPMD style.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.670
The way SPMD works is as follows.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.550
First, you'll write some
pseudocode algorithm.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.785
Then you'll imagine running
that algorithm on some cluster,

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:37.020
and you'll assume that that pseudocode
is replicated on all the nodes.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.650
We'll call every running copy a process.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.380
Each process runs independently and
asynchronously from the others

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.990
in the absence of barriers or any other
kind of explicit synchronization.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.930
Now, to distinguish the copies
from one another, we'll assume

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.180
that the pseudocode algorithm has
access to two global variables.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.090
One called RANK and one called P.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.660
Since the memories are private,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.550
these variables are private
to each running process.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.530
RANK will be the ID of the running
process and it'll be unique.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.800
P will be the number of processes.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.910
Now for the moment,
the concept of a process and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.170
the concept of a node
are basically interchangeable.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.470
But in practice, a process
virtualizes the concept of a node.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.220
That means you might have more than
one process assigned to a node if, for

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.920
example, you're running on
a multi-socket, multi-core system.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.155
Now, to see how this works, suppose
that this pseudocode algorithm contains

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.475
a line of code which reads as follows.

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:36.955
So when all the processes run,

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:39.055
they'll all print statements
of the following form.

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:43.055
I am 0 out of 5,
I'm 1 out of 5, and so on.

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:46.335
They each print their own rank and
the total.

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:51.015
Here's a second change to
a sequential pseudocode.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:54.615
I will give you a primitive which
performs an asynchronous send.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.030
Think of it as an API call
that looks like this.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.750
Now it has two arguments,
one is a buffer of size n.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.090
The second is a destination rank,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.340
basically the rank of the process that's
supposed to receive this message.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.000
Now, an important and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.099
subtle point about sendAsync is
what does it mean when it returns?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.870
When it returns, it does not mean
that the buffer has been sent.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.300
It just means that a send is
registered with the system.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.400
So in particular, until you know what's
happened you should not modify buf.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.980
To find out what happened,
sendAsync will return a handle.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.550
You can do some testing on the handle.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.880
Now, for
this send to eventually complete,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.380
the destination rank has to
post an asynchronous receive.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.590
The signature looks the same.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.970
It names buffer of some size, and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.950
it names a source rank,
source being the sender.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.810
Just like sendAsync,
when recvAsync returns,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.120
it does not mean the data is available.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.180
Rather, recvAsync will
return a handle and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.660
you should do some
testing on the handle.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.840
This business about handles brings
us to the final primitive which is

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.520
called wait.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.920
In particular, wait is a blocking
operation that takes one or

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.390
more handles as arguments.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.060
Now, wait will pause until
the corresponding operations complete.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.860
Now there's also a special form
of wait called a wait all,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.930
abbreviated here by
wait with an asterisk.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.010
This is a shorthand that says wait for
all outstanding sends and receives so

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.400
that we don't have to track and
check all the handles all the time.
