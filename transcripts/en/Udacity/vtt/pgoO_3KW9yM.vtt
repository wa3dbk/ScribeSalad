00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.880
Using what you just learned about signs of
exponents and how that relates to the side

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:12.040
of the fraction they're on, how could you
rewrite 3y-1 x^3 in fraction notation? So,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.721
just fill in what you think belongs in the
numerator here and what belong in the

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.766
denominator here. There are a bunch of
different mathematically equivalent ways

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:23.040
of doing this, but I want you to do it in
a way so that you have something that's

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.393
equal to this expression but so that there
are no negative exponents in either the

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.538
numerator or the denominator over here.
