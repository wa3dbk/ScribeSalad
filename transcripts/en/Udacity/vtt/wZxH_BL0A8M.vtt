00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.420
Now let's go back to our Performance pillars, and move on to Compute. The

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.270
first thing understand about optimizing computation for

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.790
mobile CPUs. Is of course, the mobile hardware

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.040
is generally going to be less powerful,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.430
than desktop equivalents. Your app is going

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.230
to have to deal with slower CPUs and GPUs than you're used to on desktops.
