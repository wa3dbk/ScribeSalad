00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Suppose we're playing a game--and that game is "guess the word"--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
where I want you to guess a word,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and all I'm giving you is how many letters this word has.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So assuming you haven't already skipped ahead to the next part of this unit,

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
can you guess my word?
