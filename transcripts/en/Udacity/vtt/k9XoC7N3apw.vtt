00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.972
So I'm thinking about Sally Ride again. On June 18th 1983 she became the first

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:08.823
American woman to enter a low earth orbit. I'd like to sort of mentally

00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:12.189
recreate that day, so let's start with something relatively simple that we can

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.582
do. What day of the week was that? I'm going to assign numbers to the days of

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:22.548
the week. So Sunday it'll be 0, Monday will be 1, Tuesday 2, and so on. Write a

00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:26.764
program that takes a date and tells you what day of the week that was. You'll

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:30.732
need a reference day to start with, so I'll tell you that January 1st, 1900,

00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:35.380
was a Monday. You'll want to write a program that uses this fact to count the

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.144
right number of days To get to the right day of the week. You can use the fact

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:43.540
that January 1st, 1900 was a Monday in your program.
