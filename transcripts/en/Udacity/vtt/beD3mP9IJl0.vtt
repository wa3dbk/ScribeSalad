00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.810
So, these two points where x intercepts at 2, 0 and negative 2, 0. And these

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.950
two points are the y intercepts. They're at 0, 3 and 0, negative 3. Now we can

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.168
connect these points with a smooth curve and then we'll have our ellipse. So,

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:22.326
for our circle, we had equal amounts of x squared and y squared and our radius

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:27.061
was 6. So, we started from the center and we moved 6 units left and right and

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:32.470
up and down to graph that circle. Now, for our ellipse, we're going to move two

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.698
units left and right in the x direction. And three units up and down in the Y

00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:42.860
direction. These two points are the X intercepts, and these two points are our

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.732
Y intercepts. Now, there's an easier way to graph this ellipse than finding the

00:00:47.732 --> 00:00:52.321
X intercepts and Y intercepts. Remember that this equation is the same as this

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:57.034
equation, so let's graph this one instead. I'm going to get rid of this

00:00:57.034 --> 00:01:00.206
equation first and now I'm going to write this equivalent equation in its

00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:07.370
place. We'll have x squared divided by 4 plus y squared divided by 9 equals 1.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.736
And remember that we're basing this equation on the Pythagorean Theorem. So we

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:18.840
can really think of 4 as 2 squared and we can really think of 9 as 3 squared.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.730
We could have graphed this ellipse by looking at these two numbers. The squared

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.082
number underneath the X squared term tells us to move two units left and right

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:32.635
from the center. So, since this is a two squared, we move two units to the

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:37.294
right from the center, and two units left from the center. The squared number

00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:41.572
under the Y squared term tells us to move three units up and three units down

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:47.024
from the center. This gives us a same four points and we are able to graph our

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:51.397
ellipse. In general this is the equation we use for an ellipse, centered at the

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:55.880
origin. Notice that there is no number added or subtracted to the x or to the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.040
y. So, the center would be at 0, 0. Now what I have gone ahead and done is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.808
added this equation into decimals/g. And I've created sliders, or adjustments,

00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:11.230
for the values of a and the values of b. Notice that if a and b are both 1, we

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.572
get a circle centered at the origin. This is the idea that we'll have equal

00:02:16.572 --> 00:02:21.850
amounts of x squared and y squared, and the radius would just be 1. Now, if I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.730
increase a, we stretch in the x direction 1 unit to the left and 1 unit to the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.100
right. This gives me an ellipse since I have more X squared than I do Y

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.227
squared. And, we could keep stretching our ellipse. We could have an A value of

00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:43.420
3, an A value of 4, or an A value of 5. Since the A value is underneath the X

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.687
squared term, that's the direction it stretches in. In order to stretch the

00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:53.302
ellipse vertically up and down, we want to adjust the b value. We can make the

00:02:53.302 --> 00:02:59.162
b value be 2, or 3, or even 4. And notice that if we bring it up all the way up

00:02:59.162 --> 00:03:03.580
to 5, again we'll have a perfect circle. Since we have even amounts of X

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.489
squared and Y squared. This is why it's helpful to identify the A value and the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.216
B value to graph an ellipse. The A value tells us how far we should move from

00:03:13.216 --> 00:03:16.807
the center left and right, and the B value tells us how far we should move from

00:03:16.807 --> 00:03:19.830
the center up and down.
