00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Okay, so now we have these functions to validate the user's input.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's talk about how they're going to fit into things.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So we have you, and we have our servers, and you make a request for the form.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is a GET request, and the server responds with the form data,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then you make a POST request to the server with the data.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In this case, it will be a month, day, and year.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now the server is going to run our validation functions,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and it's going to do 1 of 2 things.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If the data is good, the server will say, thanks,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but if the data is bad, the server is going to respond with the form data again,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the server will also include an error message telling user to reenter their values,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and they'll have the form handy so they can do that easily,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and then we'll go up to this phase again.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Okay, so let's talk about our approach to doing this.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We're going to have to do 3 things.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
First, we're going to have to verify the user's input.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Next, we're going to have to detect if it's an error and render the form again, maybe.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And when we're rendering that form, we're going to need to include an error message

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
because if we don't include that error message, the user is just going to hit submit on their form

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and see the form again, and they'll be confused forever.
