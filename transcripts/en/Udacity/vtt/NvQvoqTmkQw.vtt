00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.320
So you've got a working prototype, and
you've gotten some feedback from others.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.000
Now all you have to do is
just keep plugging away at it

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.820
until all of the bugs are squashed and
your app doesn't crash at any point.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.210
You might even think at this point
you're ready to submit to the app store.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.070
Sorry Charlies, it's actually time for
you to do more user testing.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.570
See, at this point,
you're just too close to your app.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.299
I mean, you know exactly
how it's supposed to work.

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:30.696
And you also know how to
avoid any sticky situations,

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:34.400
however subconsciously
you might be doing it.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.230
I mean, simply put,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.588
you just can't be trusted to
reliably test your app anymore.

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:44.698
And now it's time for,
you guessed it, more user testing!

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:48.954
In addition to your classmates, it's
also a good idea to distribute your app

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:51.443
to your family and
friends, or even better,

00:00:51.443 --> 00:00:56.100
a neutral third party who won't be
afraid to give you critical feedback.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.780
But, how do you get these apps to users?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.290
Let's take a look.
