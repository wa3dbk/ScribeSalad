00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
The lower limit of this inequality is 5, but we can see that it's not included

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:08.042
in the interval, so we need a round parenthesis. We said that there is no

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:12.083
maximum value that x could take on. That means that the possible values of x

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:16.466
could extend to infinity. And, whenever we have infinity in an interval, we need

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:20.733
to use a round parenthesis. Infinity isn't a number that we can have a hard stop

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:25.067
at. It can't be included in an interval, because it's bigger than anything we

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:29.221
can quantify. So, we have to use a round parenthesis. If you had trouble getting

00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:33.032
this, no big deal. I know this is a pretty new concept and definitely a new

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:37.019
notation with the infinity and how to use it with parenthesis. But, now you

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:37.337
know.
