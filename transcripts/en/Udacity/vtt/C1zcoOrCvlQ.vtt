Okay for this one you had 5 parts shaded, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, out of 12 parts total.

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:11.348
If you count up all the triangles you'll get 12. Here I have 3 boxes that are

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.174
shaded out of 10 boxes in the whole temple, and in this cross I have 7 triangles

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:22.659
that are shaded out, of 20 triangles total. I got 20 really quickly because I

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:27.598
noticed that there are 4 triangles in 1 box, and I had 5 different boxes, so I

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.551
just did 4 times 5, which is 20.
