00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.560
If you want to, three people say want to drink

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.640
from the same cup, but they each use a different

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.610
handle. Then they drink from different spots on the

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.040
rim. The multiple handles are signifiers as well as useful

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
affordances for sharing. These are really useful, why they've

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.950
dropped out of favor, I don't know. The only place

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.380
where you can buy them, as far as I know,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.500
is the Plymouth Plantation in Plymouth, Massachusetts where they try

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.620
to recreate 17th century living.
