00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.600
So I made a few changes to the code, see

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.860
if you agree with them. In the draw square function,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.370
I now use a loop, and this loop does my

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.430
repetitive tasks, tasks like move the turtle forward and turn it

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.650
right, and this loop runs 4 times. Then I created

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.840
a new function called draw art, in this function I

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.060
create the window screen. This is the screen that has

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.620
the background color as red, and then I create my first

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.350
turtle, which I named brad. I change brad's shape,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.299
color and speed, and then I call the draw square

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.990
function, so that I can actually draw my first

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.196
square. After that, I create my second turtle, angie. And

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:41.800
here are angie shape and color, and then angie

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.560
draws a circle. And then towards the end, I call

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.540
the draw_art function which is right here. So let

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.630
me go ahead and save, and run this program to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.672
make sure everything is running fine. And there's our two

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:56.550
turtles. One drawing a square, the other one drawing a circle.
