00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.222
p could equal negative 2, or 1 4th, excellent effort if you got that one

00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:08.472
correct. First we distribute the p then we subtract 2 from both sides. The

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:14.324
negative 2 does not have any liker terms. So we have 4p squared plus 7p minus 2

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:19.000
equals 0. We look for our greatest common factor, and the only common factor

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.644
between these three is 1. So we can't factor anything out. Now I want to find

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:28.774
factors of negative 8 that add to 7. The two factors are 8 and negative 1, they

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:33.060
multiply to give us negative 8 and they sum to give us 7. These two factors

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.110
allows to rewrite our middle term and then we can use factoring by grouping. We

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.590
continue factoring our equation by factoring a p by the first group of terms,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.505
and a 2 from the last group of terms. Next we said each of these factors equal

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:51.653
to 0. P could equal 2 or p could equal 1 4th. These are our solutions.
