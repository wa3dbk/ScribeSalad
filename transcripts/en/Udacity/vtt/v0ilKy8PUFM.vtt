For obvious reasons, we don't know what or if a fetus is thinking inside its

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:09.512
mother's womb. But we do know a lot about what infants think. In fact, we know

00:00:09.512 --> 00:00:13.608
a lot about the development of cognitive abilities across the lifespan from

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:18.612
Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Piaget argued for distinct stages of

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:23.462
development across the lifespan. The first stage he termed the sensory motor

00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:29.718
stage. Infants lack verbal behavior. They cannot think about the past and they

00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:34.290
can't plan for the future, therefore they live very much in the present moment.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.870
In the here and now. However, they do interact with their world. They use their

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.156
five senses. They can see, touch, taste, smell, and hear, and they use these

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:49.001
senses to make sense of their world. This is what Piaget meant by the sensory

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.200
part of sensory motor stage.
