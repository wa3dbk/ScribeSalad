Okay, how are we going to make this.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.510
When I have a complicated
project in front of me,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.970
I like to break it up
into smaller pieces.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.640
So, let's start there.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.630
Here's our high level to-do list.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.990
First, we need to convert a newly
recorded video into a GIF.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.740
Add a caption to the GIF we create and
share it.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.160
We also want the user to have
the option to choose from the album.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.610
And we want to enable at least some
basic editing of the video before it

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.370
becomes a GIF.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.497
Let's start with this first task and
break it down a little further.

00:00:32.497 --> 00:00:35.600
To convert a newly recorded
video into a GIF we'll need

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.640
to present a video camera and
retrieve the saved video.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.900
Convert that video into a GIF and
display that GIF in the UIImageView.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.860
So now,
we get to start with something we know.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.730
Presenting the camera.
