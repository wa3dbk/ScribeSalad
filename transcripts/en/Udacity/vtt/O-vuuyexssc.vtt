00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.150
The challenges here are similar in
many respects to those around EHRs.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.530
While efficiency may not
be quite as important,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.290
usability is arguably even more
important and difficult to achieve.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.250
Patients, including the elderly
who may not have support at home,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.310
must be able to use these technologies.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.450
The technologies are obviously capable
of generating vast amounts of data for

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.300
millions of patients.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.490
No one has time to look at it all.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.360
So analytic and visualization tools
that minimize false positives and

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.790
appropriately alert providers
are of critical importance.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.570
This is an area where
machine learning and

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.950
other tools of artificial
intelligence are being applied.
