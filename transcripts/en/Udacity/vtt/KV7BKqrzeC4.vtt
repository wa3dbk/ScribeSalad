00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.730
So now we know how to do
predicted value, right.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.560
So the p of x t given
all our measurements.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.780
So given this, and then we take a
measurement at time t, what do we want.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.300
We want the new corrected value, x of t,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.770
given y's through y t so we're folding
in the new measurement, all right.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.820
The way we're going to do that is we're
going to make use of Bayes Rule, and I'm

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.060
just going to, I have written down here
for those of you who, don't remember

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.180
Bayes Rule and don't have it tattooed
on the, inside of your right thigh.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.140
But here basically is what we're doing,
right?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.270
So Bayes rule says that if I want to
know the probability of A given B,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.650
I can flip it around by knowing
the likelihood of B given A.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.160
And then there are these
other terms in here, okay?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.920
And you'll notice what we did
here is we switched this around.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.213
This is now the probability of getting
the measurement given all these

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:59.720
previous stuff,
times the probability, what is this?

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.440
Well, that's just our prediction,
okay, that's, that's P of A.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.220
And then this, this is going to turn
out just to be a normalization factor.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.550
By using our independence assumption,
right.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.160
The independence assumption says that
our measurement y t, given x t and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.870
all this stuff,
is only a function of, x t.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.230
All right?

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.140
And the reason that I refer to this
bottom part as normalization is,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.110
remember this is
a probability over here.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.450
And basically,
they all have to sum to one.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.340
And we'll get to that later.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.055
And this, this bottom value
just normalizes everything so

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:37.205
that it sums to one.

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:41.845
And if you really wanted to
calculate that normalization, okay,

00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:43.575
what you have to do is,

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:48.350
you have to compute all the different
possible probability of getting that y t

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.840
over all of the x t predictions
over the integral over all the x t.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.690
But it, we are never ever going to be
sort of computing that bottom part.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.650
That's just there so you can see what
the sort of the total integral is.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.750
And in fact now it says
really a normalization.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.430
So it's really, really a normalization.
