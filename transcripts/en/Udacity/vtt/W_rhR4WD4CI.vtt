When you start working on your app,

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.020
one of the worst things that you
can do is re-invent the wheel.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.450
And by that I mean, by using code that's
already been written by someone else.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.170
The beauty of the internet is that
there's a plethora of information about

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.900
there that you can take from.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.410
&gt;From Apple libraries that let
you use features on the device,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.808
to web APIs that allow you to
access information on other sites.

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:26.580
So it's going to be your job as
a developer to really scrutinize

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.780
any web API or library that
you find to really make sure

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.119
that it meets the requirements
of your apps.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.890
Let's sync up again with some
of our pros for some tips and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.960
tricks on how to choose the best API and
library
