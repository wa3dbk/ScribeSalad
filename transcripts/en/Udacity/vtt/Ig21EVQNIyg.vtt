00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.234
There are two facts about the human brain that are pretty mind-blowing. First,

00:00:04.234 --> 00:00:10.060
our brain is about 25% of its adult size when we're born. On the other hand,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.662
our bodies are only about 5% of the adult size when we're born. As humans, we

00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:18.269
have really big brains. And this is both why we're helpless when we're born,

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.957
but also why we have such a capacity for learning. The brain isn't fully wired

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:26.058
at birth. We only have a few instincts when we're born, such as suckling which

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:30.134
is needed for feeding. So, we need experience to shape our brain, and that's

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:34.680
exactly what experience does. It physically changes our brain. Now, the second

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.882
cool fact is, how many neurons grow inside of the brain of a fetus. During

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:45.294
prenatal neural growth, new neurons grow at an amazing rate of 250,000 neurons

00:00:45.294 --> 00:00:51.248
per minute. And this is the during the final stage of fetal development. Now,

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:55.216
this amazing rate of neural growth continues into the first 18 to 24 months of

00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:59.813
life. Now, even though our brain grows and changes throughout life due to

00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:03.699
experiences such as learning or exercising, even eating different things, the

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.890
rate of change does slow over time. And just because we have all of these

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.999
neurons, it doesn't mean we necessarily use all of them.
