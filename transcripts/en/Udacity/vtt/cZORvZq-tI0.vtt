00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.530
Now we're going to
talk about collections.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.560
There's almost no need for
a formal definition here,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.730
since a collection is, as the name
implies, just a group of things.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.790
You could have a collection of books,
a collection of Udacity employees, or

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.290
even a collection of desk animal
things that I talk to when I'm

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.729
stuck on programming projects and
the coaches aren't around.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.120
Let's make a few observations here.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.720
Collections don't have
a particular order.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.240
You could shuffle some elements around
and it wouldn't make a huge difference.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.500
Similarly, we couldn't say, give me
the third element in this collection,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.489
since there's no inherent order.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.559
Collections also don't need to
have the same type of object.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.390
Everything in the room could be in the,
around the dusty office collection,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.150
even though there are books and
people and animal things.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.680
A collection on its own really
isn't something you can use in

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.589
a programming language.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.530
However, there are many data structures
that are extensions of collections.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.430
So, they just add more rules to the ones
that already apply for collections.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.810
Let's take a look at some of those now
