00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.710
Recursion is maybe one of the most
confusing subjects in computer science.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.230
If you get stuck at any point,
keep studying the examples and

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.930
try to find some more examples
until it sticks for you.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.629
The idea here is to create
a function that calls itself.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.900
Here is a really basic
example in pseudo code.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.380
This code doesn't do
anything interesting, but

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.790
it shows the main parts
of a recursive function.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.700
First of all, a recursive function
needs to call itself at some point.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.600
Second, a recursive
function needs a base case.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.100
You can think of a recursive function
kind of like a while loop in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.880
some regards.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.530
You keep going through some
code again and again and

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.630
again until you hit some exit condition.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.960
In a recursive function, the base
case is like the exit condition.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.410
It let's you know when you need to stop.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.879
Without a nice base case like this,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.430
you could get stuck in something
called infinite recursion.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.700
That means your code keeps calling
itself and executing again, and again,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.180
and again, and again, and again.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.160
But because you never tell it when to
stop, it just keeps going infinitely.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.250
The third thing a recursive
function needs to do

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.619
is alter the input
parameter at some point.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.839
If you aren't altering
the input parameter or

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.770
giving yourself some condition for

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.119
changing every time you iterate,
you'll never really know when to stop.

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:30.580
And again, you end up in the same
bad place with infinite recursion.

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:34.934
Okay, now we're going to
go through an example.

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:36.805
This is the code that
we're starting with, and

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:40.133
on this side, I'll write out
each major line that we execute.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:46.765
So we're going to start by calling
the function with an input value of 2.

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:49.615
We'll start with this if clause.

00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:51.765
Since our input value is 2, and

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:54.505
that's greater than 0,
we move on to the else part.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.550
We start by evaluating this before we
assign anything to the variable output.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.260
Okay, so input- 1, that's just 2- 1.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.550
So we're going to call
this function again, but

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.222
instead with an input value of 1 and
not 2.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.570
So this is the really confusing part.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.970
Your computer knows that you still
haven't finished that initial call

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.240
with the input value of 2.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.330
You're just jumping into
this part without finishing.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.290
In its temporary memory,
it will remember that.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.300
However, it essentially makes a copy
of all of this initial code, and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.250
you have to do it again, but
this time with an input value of 1.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.750
I put an indent here to signal that we
haven't actually finished this initial

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.770
call yet, but we're just doing
a call inside of that right now.

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:44.110
Okay, so let's do this again.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.600
This time, the input value is 1,
but that's still greater than 0, so

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.230
we can skip down to the else block.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.210
The same thing happens a second time.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.810
Before we assign anything to output,
we have to do this recursive statement.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.945
This time, the input value's 1,
so 1- 1 is 0.

00:03:03.945 --> 00:03:07.839
And we have to call this recursive
block again, but with a value of 0,

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:08.965
instead of 1 or 2.

00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:14.345
Again, I indented to indicate that we
still haven't forgotten about the fact

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:18.645
that we never solved this and returned
anything, but we do need to move on and

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:19.835
start executing again.

00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:22.995
All right, let's do this again.

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:25.920
So this time, we actually have
something interesting here.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.720
The input value is 0, so we never get
to execute any of this else block.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.640
We're just staying up here.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.790
We return 0, so
we see it pop up over here.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.820
Now that we've actually returned
something from one of our calls,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.340
we can forget about this recursive
with an input of 0 and go back to that

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.100
recursive with an input of 1 that
we were looking at a minute ago.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.436
All right, so
we return to having an input of 1.

00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:57.330
We evaluated this statement to 0,
as I indicated over here.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.280
Again, remember, we called
the recursive block, we return 0.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.443
So now we say that this whole
thing evaluates to 0, and

00:04:07.443 --> 00:04:10.460
we can assign 0 to output, great.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.582
Now that call we did where
the input was 1 actually

00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:17.740
has a return value here, which is 0.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.225
So now we can kind of forget
about this recursive block and

00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:25.690
move back to that original call,
where our input was 2.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.460
Okay, so back to the original call,
this call,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.219
which used to be recursive with
an input of 1, got evaluated to 0.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.850
So now we can say 0 is equal to output.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.770
And again, we can return 0, and
now even our initial call is done.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.135
Great, so the initial call returns 0.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.620
Recursion can be really confusing,
because you start out with just this one

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.710
method, but you don't even know how
many times you'll end up calling it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.300
When I'm trying to think through
how a recursive function works,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.109
I'll often write out a table or
a list of steps like this, so

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.970
I can keep track of my values every
time I hit the recursive block again.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.880
I always used to think of it like my
computer was just going on tangents.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.710
I started with this initial function,
and then I kept calling something else,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.570
and doing something else, and
doing something else, and

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.680
doing something else.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.950
And eventually, I would get back to the
thing I was talking about originally.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.799
Remember, your code is going to go
through these lines of code in order.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.830
It's never going to assign
this output any number

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.729
until you've hit the recursive
block as many times as you need.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.770
Remember to be really careful when
you're writing recursive code.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.560
If your base case doesn't make sense,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.490
you could end up doing
infinite recursion.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.110
Let's say we change this
base case just a little bit.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.250
All I did was get rid of
the less than or equal to and

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.910
replaced it with just equal to.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.560
Now this code is going to run fine
if we give it an input value of 2 or

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.500
1 or 4 or even 1 million.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.680
But if the input value
was actually less than 0,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.190
this code's never going to return.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.890
If you start out with -2,
you'll skip the if block, and

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.650
you'll just keep subtracting 1.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.640
Next time, your input's going to be -3.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.657
Then you'll subtract 1, -4.

00:06:18.658 --> 00:06:21.220
Subtract 1, -5, and so forth.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.840
If I use less than though,
if my number initially is -2 or

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.454
-50 or -1 million, I'll stop as
soon as I hit the base case.

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:35.657
Remember to think about all the
different input values your recursive

00:06:35.657 --> 00:06:36.750
statement could have.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.160
Lastly, if you're really not sure
what your recursive block is doing,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.480
you can use print statements
wherever necessary.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.290
By printing out intermediate values,

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.300
you'll get a sense of exactly what your
code is doing at exactly which steps.
