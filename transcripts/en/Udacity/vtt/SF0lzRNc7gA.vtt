00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer is one1 as we expected.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now that happens to be a trivial example of a two reasons.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One is b=1 is the most simple case of the linear relationship, but secondly, there is no noise.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This equation of b = 1 will fit to data exactly, but we did it

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to exercise the use of the formula.
