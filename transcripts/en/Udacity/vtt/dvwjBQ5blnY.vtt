00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.352
We've talked about using 
intents within Sunshine

00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:04.976
to start activities 
and send data between apps.

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:08.470
But what if you want to broadcast 
a message to many apps?

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.470
For example, the system will broadcast 
a message, saying that

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.450
the device is charging 
or that it's just finished rebooting.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.080
To do that ourselves,
we use the SendBroadcast method

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.770
to broadcast an intent. 
And those broadcasts are recieved

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.760
by broadcast receivers, typically referred
to as, simply, receivers.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.159
Using intent filters, 
like the ones we saw earlier,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.770
they indicate which broadcast 
they're interested in.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.090
So if we return to our envelope 
metaphor from earlier,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.050
in the case of a broadcast intent, 
your envelope is basically addressed

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.230
to any broadcast receiver 
that's interested in knowing

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.970
that this event has happened.
And it does that using intent filter.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.720
So intents, which are broadcast, 
are transmitted to every app

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.320
with a broadcast receiver 
that has an intent filter

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.159
telling the system 
your ideas are intriguing

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.801
to me and I wish 
to subscribe to your newsletter.
