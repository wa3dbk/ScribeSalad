00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.780
We've provided a virtual machine, with CDH, that's Clouderas

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.240
Distribution for Hadoop, pre-installed. We say that Hadoop is

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.360
running in pseudo-distributed mode, that means it's a full

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.680
cluster just running on one machine. It also includes sample

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.570
data sets and sample solutions the problems we ask

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.750
you to solve. Now would be a great time to

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.680
see the instructor notes on how to download the

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.260
virtual machine. You'll open it up, start the VM, and

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.210
then follow the step by step instructions, which show you how

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.680
to upload a file to HDFS and run a MapReduce job.
