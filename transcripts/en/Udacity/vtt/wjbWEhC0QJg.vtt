00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.778
So let's see how performance is affected by the number of cores. Suppose we take

00:00:04.778 --> 00:00:09.870
a single-core execution and we break down the time in it, according to how much

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.086
available parallelism there would be. So for 20% of the time, we

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:20.350
really can only run on one core. For 30% of the time, we

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.573
could use two cores if we had them. For 40% of the time, we could

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:32.168
use three cores if we had them. And for 10% of the time, we can use four cores

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:38.270
if we had them. Now suppose that we have a chip whose total power is 100 watts.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.489
If that power is enough to get five gigahertz

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.273
if the chip only has one core, then how

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:47.231
many gigahertz can we get when we have two

00:00:47.231 --> 00:00:50.711
cores, and how many gigahertz when we have four

00:00:50.711 --> 00:00:56.323
cores on the chip? Also if our execution time is 100 seconds for a

00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:01.979
one-core chip, it will be how many seconds for a two-core chip,

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.751
and how many seconds for a four-core chip? Keep in mind that you

00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:10.000
need to take into account the change in frequency for this as well.
