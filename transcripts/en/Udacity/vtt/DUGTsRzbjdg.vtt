00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And here's my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's pretty much just copying out the version from Pwin and making sure it fits

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
with this new definition of the parameters.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So if me plus pending is greater than goal, then the probability is 1.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Otherwise, if you wins, the probability is 0.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Otherwise, we compute the probability of winning by rolling.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And if there are no pending, then we better roll,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because if we try to hold, we'll get stuck in an infinite loop.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So the return value is just the probability of rolling if there's no pending, if pending is 0.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If there is a pending, then we want to take the maximum result

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of either rolling or dealing with holding.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
How did we do?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We've defined our new Pwin2 function.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We can call that on the same initial state, and that will do all the computations

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and cache them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And it turns out it takes just about ¼ of a second,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so it's 3 times faster than the previous version that took ¾ of a second.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And if you see the probability that it computes, it's exactly the same.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And just to be sure, you should probably go through and pick out a bunch of other states

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and test those.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I actually did it for all states and showed that all of them compute exactly the same function.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Then we can look at the size of the cache and see that that's about half as much--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
a little bit less than half as much--and that's where we're getting our speed-up.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We're only computing half as much, so it goes a lot faster.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And there's always a choice.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
When you get a speed-up like this, you can put it in the bank or you can spend it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So we can put it in the bank and say, "Now we can do in ¼ of a second

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
"what previously took ¾ of a second."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Or we can spend it. Here I'm spending it by increasing the goal to 60 rather than 40.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So much more computation to do.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Then I reload all my code so that the caches are flushed and do a timed call again,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and this time it's about ¾ of a second,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and I can do in the same amount of time--which I could only handle a goal up to 40;

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
now I can handle a goal up to 60.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And note that the probability is a little bit lower than it was before.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If the goal is farther away, then the advantage of going first is a little bit less.
