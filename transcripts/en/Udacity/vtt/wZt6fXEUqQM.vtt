00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.820
Before we go any farther, deconstructing this chart we created in the previous

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.540
lesson, I wanted to take a step back to talk about what type of narrative we

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.270
might want to build around this data, and also how we might achieve it.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.910
It is important to keep in mind as we iterate on this graphic here,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.090
that it's okay to make mistakes.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.820
And when I say it's mistakes are okay.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
I mean that the process of creating an affective and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.600
engaging visualization, is often a winding road.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.530
We may not perfectly deconstruct and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.270
build upon this chart to achieve the affect we want.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.180
We might have to backtrack, try a new approach, and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.940
go down a different direction.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.700
Again, this is all part of the process of prototyping and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.820
sketching of visualization.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.620
I've said it before and I'll say it again, is that the difference between

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.040
something like EDA and the process we're about to go through with data

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.290
visualization, is that EDA typically helps you find a message you want to tell.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.140
In my case, the message I want to convey to my audience is that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.190
we're in an increasingly global and capitalist age.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.890
What do I mean by that?

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.690
And how might I tell it?

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.920
Well, even from looking at this simple chart of total World Cup attendance over

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.060
the years, we can see that the trend of the World Cup attendance games.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.590
An aggregate is steadily increasing over time.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.950
Proving causation is very hard, as we've seen previously, but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.960
what I want to propose is that early on in World Cup history,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.530
it was one less known and less popular.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.360
But also the past was a world much more constrained by geographic and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.190
logistical issues.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.190
As we've seen advances in transportation, such as, planes and trans-Atlantic and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.280
Pacific flights, maybe people from all of the world are able to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.440
attend a World Cup Held in a single country.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.990
And the capitalist side of it is that as the games become more and more popular,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.740
both FIFA the organization that organizes the World Cup, and the home country

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.660
itself could benefit economically from the influx of visitors and tourism.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.030
But also from the games itself by creating more stadiums and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.580
more public works projects to help support the influx of people.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.540
But I'm sure you're thinking it's a far journey to go from this

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.620
simplistic line plot to convey this message is a succinct and

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.870
effective way, but that's what the next series Of videos and code will address.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.770
This iterative process of data visualization, which helps us

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.750
communicate our message in the most effective and efficient manner.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.990
We've already done our EDA, and have the message we want to tell.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.840
We just have to work and iterate, on visualization such that,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.390
we can communicate that message to our audience.
