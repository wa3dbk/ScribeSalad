00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
For question 3, your goal is to define a procedure called median,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.510
that takes three numbers as its inputs,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.410
and outputs the median, which is the middle value, of those three numbers.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.210
Here are a few examples--

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.220
If the three inputs are 1, 2, and 3--

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.650
your procedure should output 2--

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.520
if the three inputs are 9, 3, and 6--

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.160
your output should be 6, since 3 is lower than 6--

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.890
but 6 is lower than 9--

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.230
and if the three inputs are 7, 8, and 7--

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.170
well, then the median is 7.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.170
This is a pretty tough question, so I am going to give it 1 gold star.
