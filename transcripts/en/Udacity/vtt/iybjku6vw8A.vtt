00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.710
Now, I want you to actually
build the Turing machine.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.190
The goal is to right shift the input,
and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.870
place a dollar sign symbol
in front of it, and accept.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.150
Unlike our previous examples, accept
versus reject isn't important here.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.880
This is more like a subroutine
within a larger Turing machine

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.280
that you might want to build.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.930
Though you could think about it as a
Turing machine that computes a function

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.570
from all strings over the input alphabet

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.420
to a string over the tape
alphabet if you like.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.950
I'll illustrate my recommended
strategy with the example of shifting

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.369
the string 01.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.780
First, we move the head to
the end of the tape and

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.070
replace the symbol with a blank.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.420
Then, we write this symbol
one past where it was before.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.552
Then we rewind two steps and repeat.

00:00:43.552 --> 00:00:47.753
First, erasing the symbol, and then
writing it one past where it was before,

00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:49.240
like so.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.470
Then we rewind two steps.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.903
And in rewinding, we detect that we
have reached the beginning of the tape

00:00:55.903 --> 00:00:58.847
because we end up finding
the blank symbol here.

00:00:58.847 --> 00:01:02.979
We try to rewind once, and then we try
to rewind again, that would put us off

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.880
the end of the tape, but we end up
staying here at this location instead.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.870
So we end up reading a blank symbol,
and that tells us that we're finished.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.970
And so we can just write
the dollar symbol, and we're done.
