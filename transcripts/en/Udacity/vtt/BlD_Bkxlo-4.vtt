00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.169
Let's clear these fractions by multiplying through by 40. I'm going to multiply

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:08.235
the left by 40 and the right by 40. I've multiplied this side by 40 and notice I

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:12.183
didn't need to multiply these inside terms because eventually, this will get

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.352
distributed to each of them. I've put parentheses around the right side because

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:20.785
I needed to distribute the 40 to both these terms. 40 times a 4th is 40 4th or

00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:26.355
10. I know that because 40 divided by 4 makes 10. This also makes sense because

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:31.705
I can figure out 40 over 1, and then divide 40 and 4 both by 4. And I'll get 10

00:00:31.717 --> 00:00:37.090
over 1, or 10. Now, I'm going to distribute or multiply this 10 into this inside

00:00:37.102 --> 00:00:42.272
parentheses. I have 10 times negative 2 5th y here, and I have 10 times 1, here.

00:00:42.947 --> 00:00:48.057
I can reduce a common factor of 5 in the numerator and the denominator, so I get

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.912
negative 4 over 1 or negative 4y. And then, I have my 10 on the end. Notice how

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:58.080
both times I reduced before I multiplied. Usually, it's easier to reduce common

00:00:58.092 --> 00:01:03.307
factors before you multiply. Try doing that on this side. If you carry out the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.995
distribution on the right side, what terms would you get down here? Be sure you

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.172
enter a number and a variable in the first box and a number in the second box.

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:16.659
You'll also want to include both of their signs. If the term is negative, be

00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:20.426
sure to type a negative sign in front of your answer. Good luck.
