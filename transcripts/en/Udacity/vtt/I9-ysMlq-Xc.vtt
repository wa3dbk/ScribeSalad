00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.230
For the Y axis, remember we oriented it on the left, and

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.460
then also translate it margin, in the X direction.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.920
In this case just a few pixels, and then zero in the Y.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.390
In this case, touching the top of our chart.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.360
So in indigo here we have the Y-axis and the X-axis which is margin over and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.180
height down from our coordinate space which starts at 0,0.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.800
Remember, however, when we created our Y-axis count scale.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.180
The range was height to margin.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.960
So even though we don't translate our y

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.550
axis as Fiji object any it only extends to margin from the top.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.520
And before when I drew the x axis it's translated zero in the x direction.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.950
But again if you scroll back to the timescale,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.330
you'll remember that the timescale range went from margin to width.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.910
So again this starts not at zero, but margin pixels over.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.040
The call function that actually gets past the time axis and the count

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.490
axis is a way to pass the access object through the function call chain.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.470
However understanding this JavaScript function and

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.840
its nuances is beyond the scope of these videos, but

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.490
I've left some resources in the instructor notes if you'd like to dig deeper.
