00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.910
All we have to do, as we saw in the simpler examples before, is take the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.520
original function, and then, substitute 2 in a spot of every x. So we get f of 2

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.724
is equal to 2 squared minus 2 plus 2. Which is just equal to 4.
