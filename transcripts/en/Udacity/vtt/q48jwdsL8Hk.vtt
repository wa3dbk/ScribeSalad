00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.884
For the first problem, we have the quantity negative 5 squared. We have negative

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:09.274
5 twice and negative 5 times negative 5 is positive 25. For the second problem,

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:15.186
we have the negative of 8 to the 0. Remember, when I have a negative sign out in

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:20.310
front, it's a negative 1. So, negative 1 times 8 to the 0. Any number raised to

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:25.285
the 0 power is just 1 so we have negative 1 times 1, negative 1 is our answer.

00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:30.310
Number 3 is pretty tricky. We have 1 to the 100. It might be tempting to right

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:35.560
100 as the answer but we really know that this is 1 times 1 times 1 a 100 times.

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:39.834
This is a lot of ones. But we know when we multiply all these ones together,

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:44.066
we'll just end up with 1. For number four, we have the negative of 5 squared

00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:48.372
minus 2 squared. This negative sign out in front is really negative 1 times 5

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:52.579
squared, so I'm only needing to square the 5, I don't square the negative 1.

00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:57.900
This is the big difference between number one and number four. In number one, we

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:01.994
had the quantity, negative 5 squared. Here, we only have the negative of 5

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.595
squared. So, we just square the 5. Five squared is 25 times negative 1 is

00:01:06.607 --> 00:01:11.650
negative 25. Then, I have a minus 4 on the end. Two squared is four. Negative 25

00:01:11.662 --> 00:01:16.479
minus 4. Well, I have negative 25 and negative 4. So, that's more negatives. I

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:21.331
have negative 29. And finally for number 5, we have the quantity, negative 4

00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:26.339
plus 7 squared. Remember, we can't distribute the square over the sum. We need

00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:31.469
to add these numbers together first, then do the square. Negative 4 and 7 make 3

00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:35.419
and 3 squared is simply 9. If you got at least half of these right, excellent

00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.710
work. Some of these were a little bit tricky, so it's okay if you didn't get all

00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:40.613
of them right, but I'm sure you will next time.
