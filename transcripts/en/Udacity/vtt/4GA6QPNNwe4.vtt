00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.950
River to upper case returns MISSISSIPPI in all caps. River to lower case

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.350
returns mississippi in all lower case. And river to upper case to lower case

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.508
returns mississippi, also in all lower case. Because it does the first method

00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:19.540
call first, and then it does the second method call on the returned value for

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.005
the first method call. After all these calls, river still contains Mississippi.

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.210
It doesn't change. None of these methods changed the original string.
