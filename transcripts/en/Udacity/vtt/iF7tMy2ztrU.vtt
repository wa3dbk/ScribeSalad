00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can illustrate this idea of reducibility by introducing another problem on social networks

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that we'll call the S independent set problem and the problem goes like this.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Given the graph H and a number S, is there a set of nodes of size S, the set is a size S not the nodes,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in H such that node to node in the set are connected in the original graph H.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In some sense, they're independent of each other.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You can think of this as the find the strangers problem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So they need to be in the social network together but none of them know each other.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So for example, if we look in this graph H for an independent set size of three,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We noticed that there is at least this triple, this set of nodes where none of the pairs know each other.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We can't make it any bigger than this at least including those three nodes

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because every other nodes that we didn't include is connected to at least one of these guys.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I think this is probably the biggest independent set in this graph.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
All right, so now what we're going to try to do is reduce this problem to K-clique

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or more concretely show how a polynomial time solution

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to K-clique solves the S-independent set problem.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So here's four approaches that we might be able to use to solve this problem.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
One is first note that the S-independent set problem can be solved by guessing a set of nodes,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then making sure that none of the pairs of nodes in that set are connected.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
All you have to do is check SÂ˛ edges or big Î˜ of SÂ˛ edges so this runs in polynomial time.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Here's another possibility. Let's actually take the graph H and run the S-clique algorithm on it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That is to say the K-clique algorithm that we use when looking for a clique of size S,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and whatever it returns, return the opposite of the answer.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The idea being that if a graph has a very big clique in it, there's lot of nodes

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that are densely connected, then it's unlikely to have a large independent set.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
All right, here's another approach.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Let's take the graph H and build a new graph G that is the complement of H.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That is to say every place there's an edge in H.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
There's no edge in G. Every place there's no edge in H. There is an edge in G.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Then we run the S-clique algorithm that the K-clique algorithm looking for a clique of size S

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
on this new graph G and whatever answer it gives just return the opposite.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So if it says that there's an S-clique in G return false

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and if it says there's no S-clique in G then return true.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And this last option is the reverse of that, so you build the complement graph.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You look for a size S-clique in that graph and if there is one say yes and if there isn't one say no.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So think about these a little bit.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Maybe even sketch an example problem for yourself to see which of these makes sense.
