00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.700
An Internet worm first scans for vulnerable

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.360
hosts, then infects them, and finally, typically takes

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.010
steps to remain undetectable. A worm does

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.660
not necessarily need to patch the host vulnerability,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.870
although some Internet worms have been known

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.090
to do so, to prevent other worms from

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.650
subsequently infecting the machine and interfering with the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.410
original worm infection. For example, if a worm

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.460
was intending to spread to construct a botnet that launched a particular

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.550
attack or was being used by a botmaster for a particular attack, then

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.730
whoever had commandeered the machine, probably

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.540
wouldn't want other attackers to come in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.540
behind him and also infect the machine and interfere with the planned attacks.
