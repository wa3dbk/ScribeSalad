00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.528
As I talked about earlier, if 2 lines are parallel, that means that they have

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.305
the same slope. Considering what parallel means, and your understanding of how

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:16.995
to form equations of different lines, can you tell me, then, what the equation

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:21.177
of a line parallels to the line, y equals 1/2x plus 3, but that has a y

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.620
intercept of 0 negative 2 would be.
