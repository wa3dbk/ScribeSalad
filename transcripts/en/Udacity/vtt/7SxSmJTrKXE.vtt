00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.980
Now, as you've probably heard over and
over and

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.540
over again,
there's no reward without risk.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.120
And we often want to consider
multiple stocks together and

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.270
evaluate their risk versus return.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.720
So, one way we can do that is
plot them on a scatter plot

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.890
where each dot here
represents one stock.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.060
So risk goes along this axis.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.350
Return is along this axis.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.750
So for instance,
this stock here has higher risk,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.850
but about the same return as this stock.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.650
And then for comparison,
this stock here has shown, historically

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.390
about the same risk as this stock,
but it's got a much higher return.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.960
Now we can build the portfolio
by combining multiple assets,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.810
like the various stocks I've got
plotted here and waiting each asset

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.580
by a particular wait that represents
it's allocation within the portfolio.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.710
So each stock has a wait and
when combined altogether

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.340
we end up with a portfolio that has
properties of each of the stocks.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.330
It's typically got a risk
somewhere in the middle there and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.960
a return somewhere in the middle
