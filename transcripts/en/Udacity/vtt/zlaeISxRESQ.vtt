00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.450
To answer that question, we need to rearrange our data a

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.730
little bit. Right now, our data is in long format. We

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.710
have many rows. And, notice how that the variables that we

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.750
grouped over, male and female, have been repeated. They're repeated for each

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.880
year. So let's do something else besides this long data format.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.400
What we're going to do is convert it to a wide format. This

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.530
new data frame will have one row for each age, and

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.350
then we'll put the median friend count inside of males and females.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.830
Many times when computing with and exploring data,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.860
it's helpful to move back and forth between these

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.740
different arrangements. To carry this out in R,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.440
we're going to be using the reshape2 package. Now, if

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.210
the different between wide and long data is

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.160
still a little bit fuzzy to you, I recommend

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.490
pausing the video right now. You can read through

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.900
another example in the instructor notes before moving on.
