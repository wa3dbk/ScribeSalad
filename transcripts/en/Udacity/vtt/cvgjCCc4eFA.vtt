00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.440
Okay now that we've talked through
a few examples of goals and

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.820
metrics to track, let's go
through a few scenarios together.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.430
I want you to match the following goals
with the best metric options you see

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.268
below, by writing the corresponding
letter in the boxes you'll see.

00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:16.800
First, for learntofly.com,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.900
your goal is to increase qualified
traffic to your website for

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.938
your flight school business by
10% each month for six months.

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:28.800
And we want to increase traffic to be
from people who can actually afford

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.800
flying lessons and who have time
to devote to flying lessons.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.020
Okay, now for
the second scenario movieman.com,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.040
you have a video streaming service and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.310
you notice that 30% of the people
are dropping off after the first month.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.590
Your goal is to decrease drop off
by 20% over the next four months.

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:51.423
You're metric options are A,
