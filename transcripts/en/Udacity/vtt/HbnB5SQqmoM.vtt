00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.603
let's say we randomly assigned people with insomnia to one of two treatment

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:09.689
conditions. In one condition, participants received 20 milligrams of ambien, and

00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:14.568
in the other condition patients received a placebo pill. The participants did

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.795
not know which they received. After taking their pills, the participants slept

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:25.085
in a sleep laboratory to help control for lurking variables. The next morning,

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:30.272
they rated their quality of sleep on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very poor

00:00:30.284 --> 00:00:35.030
quality of sleep and 10 being excellent. They reported this scale to a

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:40.371
psychologist who also did not know which treatment each person was assigned to.

00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:45.345
It turns out that the people in the ambien group reported a higher quality of

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:50.295
sleep with an average of 8, whereas the people in the placebo group reported an

00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:54.920
average of 5. What can we say is true about this scenario? Select all that

00:00:54.932 --> 00:00:55.295
apply.
