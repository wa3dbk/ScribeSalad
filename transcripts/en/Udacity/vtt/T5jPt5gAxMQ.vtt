00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.240
This is one of the fun things about
neural networks because you have

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.070
this general framework and

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.560
lots of small building blocks that
you can assemble in that framework.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.810
You can explore lots
of ideas quickly and

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.320
come up with interesting model
architectures for your problem.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.130
Next, we're going to look at how to
handle text as an input to a deep model.
