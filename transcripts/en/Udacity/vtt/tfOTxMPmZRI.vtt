00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.230
Hi, we're here with Tomer Sharon, a
senior user researcher in Google search.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.380
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.860
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.160
&gt;&gt; So, what is user research?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.240
&gt;&gt; User research is a discipline
that is providing insights,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.820
keyword insights, into product users,
their perspectives and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.320
abilities to the right
people at the right time.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.210
So that's the official definition.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.728
To make it more understandable,

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:29.420
user research is there to help
answer three big questions.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.130
The first one is what do people need?

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.280
The second is what do people want?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.450
Which is different than what they need.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.520
And the third one is can they use
the thing that we're working on?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.239
Whatever the thing is.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.770
&gt;&gt; Is user research only for new ideas?

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.810
&gt;&gt; No.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have a job.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.780
You start, you have a new idea,
you validate or invalidate it.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.750
There are tons of decisions
an entrepreneur is making about their

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.910
product every day.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.120
I'm not saying all of them should
be covered by user research, but

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.360
it's not just for new ideas.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.180
If you have, if you want to develop,
we all do, we have new ideas for

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.810
new features and
how to improve the product.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.740
Some of them may involve,
again, a lot of work.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.670
So for those things that may involve
a lot of work, I would try and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.560
find out if they're worth it.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.960
Again, is it a problem worth solving?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.800
&gt;&gt; Or a feature?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.370
&gt;&gt; Or a feature.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.690
Yes.
Definitely.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.400
&gt;&gt; So, how do I move from
user research to decisions?

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.490
&gt;&gt; So, in order for

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.690
you to make decisions,
you first need to know what about?

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.530
And that leads me to how do we
start the process of users.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.730
The first thing you need to do is
make it very clear for yourself, and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.610
for your team, what is the question
that we're trying to answer.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.970
So after you did your research,
if we want to move to making decisions,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.410
you first need answers
to those questions.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.270
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; That you started with.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.030
What happens in many
cases is that you have

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.100
answers to questions
that you didn't ask.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.470
You didn't know how to ask, or

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.980
you weren't even aware
that they were questions.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.070
That's fine.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.730
But if you want to start with research,
the first thing you

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.570
need to do is make a list of
the questions you're trying to answer.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.340
What are the questions that we will have
answers to by the end of this research?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.500
This research effort will fail if we
don't have answers to these questions.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.130
&gt;&gt; So
I write a list of all the assumptions?

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.010
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.780
Assumptions is a perfect
way to describe it.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.130
An assumption can easily be
translated into a question.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.560
And it doesn't have to be long.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.510
Sometimes one, two, three questions,
it's perfectly fine, okay?

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.060
So as soon as you are done with
research, you should have answers.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.450
Those answers can help
you make decisions.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:10.020
I always start when my team and
I are trying to start a research effort.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.480
I always try to identify
where is this coming from?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.700
Why are we talking now?

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.420
And I'm doing that because I'm trying
to understand what is the question that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.180
we're trying to answer.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.690
So I'm looking for
dilemmas that people or teams have.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.730
Arguments that they have.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.700
I attend a lot of meetings and
I just watch.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.360
Sometimes we have data
that we can't explain.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.349
Why is this happening?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.550
And things like that.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.640
So, this can be translated
into questions and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.210
then answers, and these answers
would lead us to making decisions.
