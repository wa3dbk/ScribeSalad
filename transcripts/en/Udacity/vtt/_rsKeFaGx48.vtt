00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.376
So adding attributes to instances like we did here works okay. But it doesn't

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:09.090
really give us what we wanted with types. We want types to be generally useful.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.240
We don't want to have to manually add all the attributes every time we create a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.756
new instance. We want them to be really part of the type. So the way to do this

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:20.251
is to add code to the class definition itself. Remember, we define the class?

00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:24.747
And, defining a method is just like defining a procedure. The difference is it's

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:29.080
done inside a class. The syntax is the same, so let's try moving our display

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.659
restaurant procedure in to the restaurant class. So here's what we had before.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:37.883
We just moved this inside the class, so now, its indented as a block inside the

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:40.988
class. I'm going to make one change to it, since now, it's inside the restaurant

00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:45.784
class. We don't really need to have the name restaurant as part of it, so I'm

00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:49.762
going to remove the restaurant there. And I'm going to also add a doc string,

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:54.806
that's just good programming practice. That, all display does is print out some

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:59.324
information about the restaurant. So now, let's try that, and we're going to

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:03.540
actually be in for surprise. Turns out, it's actually quite a pleasant surprise.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.499
But, let's see if you can follow along what happens. So let's try that. And we

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:15.645
can see that there is a display attribute. That was defined as part of the

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:20.475
restaurant object, because this definition inside the class. And we can see what

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:23.507
it is, is a method. Doesn't tell us too much about the method, but it is a

00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:29.081
method. And let's try and call it. And it takes one input will pass the

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:32.730
mcdowells. We're going to see that we didn't actually want to do that. So,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.532
here's what happens, that we actually get an error. And the error we get is that

00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:43.158
it says it takes exactly one argument, but there were two given. Hm, I don't see

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:49.201
two arguments, I only see one. Well, this is a shortcut that we get with

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:54.713
methods. And, the shortcut we get is the first argument is actually this one,

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:59.162
it's the one before the name of the method. So here's what's going on here. If

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:03.188
we have an object followed by a dot, followed by an attribute, which is the

00:02:03.188 --> 00:02:07.486
method, and we pass in parameters. What that really means is that we're calling

00:02:07.486 --> 00:02:12.210
this method with the first parameter already bound to this object. So there's a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.104
little bit of magic, which is that the parameter's already bound to the object,

00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:19.815
but otherwise, it's just like a normal procedure call. So let's look more

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:24.000
closely at what the value of the mcdowells.display attribute is. It's a bound

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.148
method, and that means it's already got its first input bound, and it's bound to

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:33.950
the object that was created so this is the restaurant object. If we look at

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.670
McDowell's, that's exactly the object that it's bound to. These values here

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.208
don't really mean anything other than they allow us to uniquely identify

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:47.295
objects. So we can see that it's bound to the same object as McDowell's. And

00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:52.310
now, if we call it, we only need to pass in no parameters, since the first

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.218
parameters is the one that's already bound. And now, we still get an error, we

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:02.206
get an attribute error, because our object has no name attribute. We need to

00:03:02.206 --> 00:03:07.544
give it one. And now, when we call the display method, we add an attribute to

00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:11.966
this object. We didn't change the object. So, display is still bound to the same

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:16.394
object we created, which now has a name attribute. And now display, prints out

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:18.409
McDowell's Mansion of Meatiness.
