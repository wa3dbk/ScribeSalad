00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right, let's practice this again,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but this time, we've flipped the problem around.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've drawn the finite-state machine

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
accepting that phone number language that we were just dealing with

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the last problem.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
However, I have left the label for the edge between 4 and 5 blank.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Your mission is to fill it in.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What should this edge label be so that this finite-state machine

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
accepts those phone numbers?
