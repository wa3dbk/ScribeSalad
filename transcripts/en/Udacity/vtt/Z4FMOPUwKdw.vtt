00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.130
The square root example has to do with specifying the properties of the results

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.250
of a computation of a function. We might also consider situations where

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.590
the effect of a particular operation is to change the attribute values for some

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.430
class. How might we do that? Well, let's consider the example of a bank account.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.560
And has an attribute which is the current balance and has operations for

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.130
deposits and withdraws. We might wish to guarantee that the balance,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
the current balance reflects any deposits that are made and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.460
any withdrawals that are taken out. How might we express such a constraint?

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.341
Well here's an example, if we have a deposit operation in the account class,

00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:48.803
that takes a real argument. Which is the amount being deposited and

00:00:48.803 --> 00:00:54.417
as the sanity check we make sure that the amount is greater than 0,

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:59.810
that's the precondition. We might try to express the post-condition

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.480
with something like saying the balance equals balance plus the amount.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.270
However, remember that the OCL is a declarative language. An equal sign here

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.530
means equality it doesn't mean assignment. So what we're saying with this

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.640
as the way that it's written is the balance equals the balance plus the amount.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.660
Well, that can't be the case. All right, that doesn't make sense. Fortunately,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.620
OCL has a mechanism for allowing us to express these sorts of situations where

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.780
we're changing, changing values. And that particular mechanism is,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.780
consists of an @ sign followed by the, the word pre.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.850
And what that denotes is the value before the operation executed.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.370
If we don't use @pre than what we're seeing when we express balance or

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.908
deposit is the value afterwards. So we can express the post-condition

00:01:53.908 --> 00:02:00.580
this time correctly by saying that balance equals balance @pre plus amount.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.150
That is, we take the previous ba the previous balance,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.330
add in the amount being deposited and we get the new balance.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.780
Looks like an assignment segment, but it's really an equality.
