Well, the greeting will be Hello World, the text that's enclosed inside these

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.107
quotes. Let me show you how that works. I will be using this programming

00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:17.510
environment, called BlueJ. BlueJ is a great environment for learning Java, and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.590
I hope you have a chance to download and install it on your computer. If not,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.734
it's okay. You can use a simpler environment that's a part of the web course.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:29.660
BlueJ is really nice, and I really encourage you to go ahead and download it.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.070
You'll find a link with installation instructions in the instruction notes. We

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.500
also gave you all of the code that we're using in this class, so you should

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.540
download that too.
