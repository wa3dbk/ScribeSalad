00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.180
So let us suppose that I go to a number of restaurants, and

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.540
have various kinds of meals and sometimes get an allergic reaction.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.220
I do not understand why I'm getting this allergic reaction,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.620
under what conditions do I get the allergic reaction. So go to an ER agent and

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.240
say, dear ER agent tell me, under what conditions do I get allergic reactions.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.260
And I give all the data, shown in this table, to the AI agent. Note that there

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.490
are only five examples here, like we mentioned in knowledge-based AI we want to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.520
do learning based on a small number of examples because that's how humans do

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.770
learning. Note also, that the first example is positive. And

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.690
that there are both positive and negative examples. That is important so

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.260
we can, construct both specializations and generalizations. How then,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.330
may an AI agent decide the conditions under which I get allergic reaction. So

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.620
this examples are coming one at a time, and let us see what happens when

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.420
the first example comes. Here is the first example. The restaurant was Sam's.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.940
Meal was breakfast. Day was Friday. The cost was cheap.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.760
So from this one example, I can construct both a very specific model, which is

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.930
exactly this example. Sam's, breakfast, Friday, cheap. You can't have anything,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.800
more specific than this. And the AI agent can also construct a more general

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.710
model. Which of course is, that it can be any restaurant, any meal, any, day and

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.430
so on. You can't construct a more general model than this.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.710
So the most specialized model based on this one example says that, I'm allergic

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.020
when I go to Sam's and have breakfast on Fridays and the cost is cheap. And

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.820
the most general model says, I'm allergic to everything. No matter where I go,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.941
what meal I have, on what day, and what the cost is, I feel allergic.
