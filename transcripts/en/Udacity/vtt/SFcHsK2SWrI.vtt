00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] Here's our first programming 
exercise.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'd like you to make a robot that starts 
at coordinates 30 and 50,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and it heads north, which means its 
heading direction is pi/2.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It then turns clockwise by pi/2, which 
means you subtract pi/2 from the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
heading direction, and it moves 15 meters.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It then senses, and I want you to print 
out the sensor measurements.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It then turns clockwise by pi/2 again, 
and moves 10 meters this time

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.869
and I just want you to print out the
sensor measurements after this entire

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.270
procedure. So, there are 2 print
statements for the sensor over here

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.192
and the sensor measurements over here. So,
here's the output I would like your

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:45.000
program to generate.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
After the first motion, the first
measurements will be 39 plus something,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.090
46, 39, and 46.

00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:58.622
And then after the second motion I expect
to see 32, 53, 47, 40.

00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:01.522
Of course, there's lots of decimal-point
numbers over here,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.650
but these are the numbers I would expect
you to output.

00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:07.432
So, have fun coding it!
