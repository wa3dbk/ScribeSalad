00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.517
And the answer is no. Even without multiplying in another linear factor, we can

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:09.343
multiply other numbers in. For example, if I multiplied in a factor of 3, we

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:14.185
would still only have zeroes at 2, 3, and 4. Multiplying in a constant term,

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:15.979
doesn't change the linear factors.
