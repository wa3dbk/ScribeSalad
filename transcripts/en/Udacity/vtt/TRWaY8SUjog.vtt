00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.763
So here's the same function as the function that we had for calculating the area

00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:07.582
of Grant's fun room, except I've removed the domain restriction, and therefore

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:12.002
also removed the range restriction. So the first question I have for you about

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:17.020
this entire graph is, what is the domain of f of x? Please write your answer

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.574
interval notation.
