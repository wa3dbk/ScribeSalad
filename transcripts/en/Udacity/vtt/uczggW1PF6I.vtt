00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.270
The final major feature we want to look at with state charts are called

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.010
history states. Here's a nested state machine.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.330
Where the two external states are the command state and the backing up state.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.840
And there are transitions from the backing up state into the command state,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.832
two transitions there. And there's a transition from the command state,

00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:26.770
to the nested state into a circle labeled with a label H.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.880
This is an example of a history state. And what it says is,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.320
let's remember whichever state we were in, in the backing up machine, the last

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.560
time we were there. And we left. And, when I'm entered into the history state,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.882
I'll go to the state that I was last in. Whether it was collecting, copying,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:54.880
or cleaning up. I could even go so far as to

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.830
label the circular state H star. And that says,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.890
if any of the the states and the backing up state were themselves nested,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.690
I could go to the sub-states that were there. This is quite a,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.060
quite powerful feature, but it can get you into diagrams that are kind

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.400
of hard to read because you may have to remember what state you were in,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.570
and also look into the, the various nesting levels.
