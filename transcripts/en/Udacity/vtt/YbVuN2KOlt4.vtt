00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.150
Hi, and welcome to Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA. In the

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.610
last few months, I learned about R, a programming language, and EDA

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.420
with the help of my friends from Facebook. And in this course,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.410
I'll teach you how to use R to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.810
&gt;&gt; EDA is one part of the

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.010
larger process of collecting, learning from and acting

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.350
on data. In this course, I'll share

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.730
my advice about working with data and visualizations.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.640
&gt;&gt; By the end of this course,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.930
you should feel confident when exploring new data

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.250
sets to uncover meaningful patterns. In the last lesson,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.190
I'll walk you through an analysis of the

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.600
diamond market with an eye toward building predictive models.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.880
&gt;&gt; We're excited to teach this course, and to show you

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.460
how EDA can be used to answer questions with data. But before

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.620
we dig in to EDA, let's talk about data. Data is

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.900
ubiquitous. You can find information about

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.990
hurricanes, forest fires and state finances

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.650
on websites like data.gov. Social networking sites like

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.400
Facebook, where we work. Collect petabytes of data everyday.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.780
And some people have started tracking their own personal

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.540
data using calendars, mobile apps, and physical activity trackers.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.290
&gt;&gt; There is so much data out there in

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.530
the world, and so little of it has been explored.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.970
For example, I was poking around on Google trends

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.080
the other day and here's what I found. I searched

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.940
for the word chicken, because I had read a

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.580
news article that morning about chicken food poisoning and salmonella.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.050
And when I search for the word, Google Trends gave

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.710
me this graph. This graph shows the interest in searching

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.650
for the word chicken over time. In reality, it's counting

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.280
how many times we see chicken in any newspaper headlines

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.380
in a given month. So from 2005 to 2013, we

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.070
can see that occurrences of chicken has been increasing. Now,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.480
I didn't want to stop my search there, so I decided

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.290
to enter two more generic word to see what I could find.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.620
So I added the word music and I added the word movies.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.170
And then I got this graph. Now when you look at this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.840
graph, tell me some things that you notice. You can talk

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.120
about anything interesting that you find in this graph, or you might

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.150
compare the first graph to this one and write some things that

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.134
you find. Now, keep in mind there is no right or wrong

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:09.460
answer here, I just want to get you thinking about data.
