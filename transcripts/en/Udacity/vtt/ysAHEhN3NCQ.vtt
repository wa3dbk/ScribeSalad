00:00:00.138 --> 00:00:03.090
Let's revisit the string
to int conversion problem.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.650
Remember that this invocation
should return an int value or

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.008
nil if the string can't be converted.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.593
But of course, z is a plain old int.

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:13.136
It can't store nil.

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:15.792
That's why the compiler's complaining.

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.496
It's time to make an optional.

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.149
Z shouldn't be an int.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:24.244
It should be an optional that can store
either of two things, an int or nil.

00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:28.159
We change the data type of z,
and the compiler is happy.

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.340
Let's look at our other example, a
property that should be able to be nil.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.998
Here's our simple
View Controller subclass, and

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:38.905
we want it to have a button property,
but it won't have a value right away.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:43.785
The value will be assigned after it's
constructed, perhaps by Storyboard.

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:47.193
But the compiler won't accept it,
because this is not an optional,

00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:48.263
it can't store nil.

00:00:48.263 --> 00:00:51.152
So the class can't ever be created.

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:54.328
There's no button value
set in the constructor.

00:00:54.328 --> 00:00:57.313
We need this property
to be a conditional, so

00:00:57.313 --> 00:01:00.311
that its value can be nil
until it gets set up.

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:04.040
So we redeclare it with a question mark,
and the compiler is happy
