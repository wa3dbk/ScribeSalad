Now let us see how partial order planning, sometimes also called nonlinear

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.030
planning, may work for our ladder and ceiling problem. So here is a goal state,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.030
painted ladder. There is the initial state. We can now use the goal knowledge as

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.560
control knowledge to select between different operators available in this world.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.970
The only operator whose post conditions match the goal condition of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.475
painted ladder. And whose preconditions are compatible with the initial status,

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:29.950
paint-ladder. So we'll select that operator.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.770
When we think of applying the operator paint-ladder to the initial state,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.450
we get this as a successor state. Painted ladder and not dry ladder are coming

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.520
from the post conditions of paint-ladder. Robot and floor, and ceiling, dry,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.910
have been propagated from the initial state. We changed dry ladder to not dry

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.880
ladder because that was the post condition of paint-ladder. We did not change

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.665
the on robot floor and dry ceiling because pain ladder was silent about them.
