00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.000
So I'm just going to show how I added
the polyline to the map with all my

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
different ice rinks.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.898
So to draw the polyline, I set up
the latitudes and longitudes for

00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:10.444
all the different ice rinks, Renton,
Kirkland, Everett, Lynnwood, etc.

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:12.650
And this time I'm just setting
them as LatLng objects.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.270
Earlier they were marker options,
but now they're just latitudes and

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.430
longitudes.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.510
I set up my camera position to be
exactly as I did in the earlier sample.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.276
Now in my onMapReady, I just move
the camera to my camera position,

00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:25.341
which is Seattle.

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:28.090
And then to draw the polyline
I just call map.Polyline.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.440
It's a new Polyline object,
geodesic true,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.810
and then I just add all
of the latitudes and

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.200
longitudes that I had created earlier,
Renton, Kirkland, Everett, Lynnwood.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.560
Notice that I begin at Renton and
I also add Renton at the end.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.690
And then this just closes the shape.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.760
Because what will happen when you draw a
polyline is it will draw from Renton to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.260
Kirkland, from Kirkland to Everett,
from Everett to Lynnwood, etc.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.600
So, if I want to close the shape,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.160
I just want to go back to
the initial one at the end.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.999
And then I will get all my rinks drawn
into a polygon like shape by adding

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:01.910
a polyline.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.830
And this is what it will look like.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.880
Here you can see on my tablet I
have the same map of Seattle, and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.670
I have all the endpoints
of the different rinks.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.990
My home rink of Renton that I showed
earlier on is the beginning and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.330
ending point, and then the polylines
get drawn from Renton to other rinks.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.652
So for example,
this is the rink in Kingsgate.

00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:22.830
You can see,
Kingsgate highlighted there.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.810
Or I can go all the way
the rink in Everett, etc.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.430
So, these are the polylines that I've
drawn from me connecting the rinks.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.684
And because I just joined the last rink
at ShoWare back to Renton in my code

00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:36.150
the shape gets completed.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.230
And as you can see here,
my second last one was ShoWare.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.600
I then added Renton and
the shape got completed.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.380
So my polyline actually
became a polygon.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.440
You can actually also
do a map.addPolygon and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.080
specify the endpoints and
it will auto close it for you.
