00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So in this problem, we're going to try to build up a given row of Pascal's triangle.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So you could solve this problem recursively, and that's what I did my first time,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but I feel that the iterative solution is a bit simpler and more intuitive to understand.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This isn't always the case, but this is how I'm going to explain this problem.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What we're going to do is, we're going to start with a list that's row 1,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and then we're going to build the next list by adding the 2 numbers above it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
More precisely, let's say we're doing the last row, and we have the previous row

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
already made, we're going to start an invisible 0 here,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and we're going to say, 1 is going to be the sum of the 0 number that I just made up

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and the 1 that's the first element of the previous row.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We're going to update our pointers to move over by 1,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we get to the element 4 by adding 1 and 3.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm going to repeat this process all the way through.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
6 is 3 + 3. 4 is 3 + 1. 1 is 1 and 0.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So that's pretty easy to explain, and that's basically how you would do it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
if you were building it out by hand,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but putting it in a code may be a little bit more complicated and involuted you.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So let's see how it's done.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So if I initialize the first row in the triangle to 1.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We don't have anything for a result yet, so that's an empty list.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm then going to iterate through the process of building each row, 1 at a time, n times.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That way we can get to the nth row.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We're going to append the row that we just discovered onto the result list.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The first time around it will just be the list of 1 because that's how the triangle starts.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We're then going to find the next row, which I haven't defined yet,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and then repeat this process appending the current row onto the result list.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Once we're done, we're going to return the result.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So this is a good outline of what we're doing, but we're missing the most important part,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and that is the make_next_row.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So a row is going to start as an empty list.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
As I had the 2 pointers before, we're going to have the previous one

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and then we're going to have one that I'm going to call e.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So as I said in the description, we're going to start out with 0.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
That way when we add 1, we get 1, which is the sides of the triangle.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We're going to calculate the new entry in the current row

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
by adding e--that's our right pointer--with the previous one that we start at 0

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
so that we get 1.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We're going to update the values in previous and then the next iteration,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
e will update to the next value in row.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This last line basically includes the 1 on the right-hand side.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Once we return result, triangle can use make_next_row accordingly, and we're done.
