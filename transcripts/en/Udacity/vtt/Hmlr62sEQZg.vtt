00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's think of a simple answer first.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Suppose I want to send a message to Alice.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If I want confidentiality, I can put that in an envelope, seal the envelope,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and write that it's for Alice.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
To make sure my seal is good, I'll make sure that no one else can open this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I could give the message to Alice.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now, the problem is if Bob is jealous and the mere fact

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that I'm communicating with Alice would cause problems

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I can't just hand the message to Alice. That would show that we're communicating.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What I'm going to do instead is use Coleen.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm going to give the message to Coleen and ask Colleen to give the message to Alice.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I will have a new envelope. I'll give this to Coleen.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What I'll put in that envelope is the message I want to give to Alice.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This also has a very secure seal, so no one else will open the message,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I give it to Coleen.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If someone sees me giving a message to Coleen, well, there's no problem there.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Coleen would open the message and see that it's got a message to give to Alice.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Then she could give the message to Alice.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This works a little bit, and Coleen could open the message and give it to Alice.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
How well does this scheme work?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The question is which of these properties are necessary

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for this scheme that I just described to successfully hide the fact

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that I'm communicating with Alice?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Requires complete trust in Coleen?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It require that Bob cannot see when I talk with Coleen?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It requires that Bob must not be able to see when Coleen talks with Alice?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It requires that Bob must not be able to see both communications

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
when I talk with Coleen and when Coleen talks with Alice?
