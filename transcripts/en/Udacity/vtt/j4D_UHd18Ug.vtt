00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.260
I'd like to conclude this lesson with a couple of

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.350
quizzes. Just to recap what we saw. And, make sure that

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.000
everybody's on the same page. In the first quiz, I want to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.930
know whether an UML state transition diagram specifies a set of

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.320
objects that work together to perform some action. The events that

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.870
cause an object to move from one state to another. The

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.840
set of components in a system, or the effects of a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.270
state change. And as usual, you should mark all that apply.
