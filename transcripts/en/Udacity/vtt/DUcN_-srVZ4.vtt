00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Many organizations use a software change control board,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
or SCCB to set priorities.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is a group of people who look into the problem database

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and take care of the handling of the problems.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Such a group typically consists of developers, testers, and managers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What they do is the keep track of resolved and unresolved problems,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
assign a priority to individual problems,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then assign these problems to individual developers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
As you can see, a problem database is a very important tool

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in the management of a product.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
All the discussion on all the features eventually is stored in here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You can even use it as a tool for requirements management.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
When the project starts you enter a single problem in here,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which states the product is missing.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Then you add up more requirements and more requirements,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which eventually will have to be fulfilled.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
A board like the SCCB then decides who should take care of

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which issue and when.
