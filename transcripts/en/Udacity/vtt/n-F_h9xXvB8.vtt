00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.017
solution, And he wants to get the most bang for his buck. What new line

00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:16.046
could we graph on this coordinate plane ... To help us figure out how many

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:20.092
gallons of solution Grant could buy from each of these three companies ...

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:26.326
For $850? Please put the equation for that line in this box right here.
