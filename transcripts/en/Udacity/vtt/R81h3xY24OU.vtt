00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The chief financial officer is more than likely the economic buyer.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The saboteur might actually be the existing business intelligence group

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
inside of IT or the CIO's department

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
who is actually trying to already build the software,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and they might be afraid they're going to lose their jobs,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so in every major organization you might find people

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
who actually don't want or actively attempt to block a sale.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The CIO is more than likely the decision maker.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In some organizations they can actually sign off on large deals,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but in this case the chief information officer

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is actually going to recommend to the chief financial officer

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that they buy this software.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The report users, the people who actually use the product,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in this case they're just simply the influencers,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and that's kind of interesting to remember because

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
sometimes those entrepreneurs, we forget that the people

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
who use our product are not necessarily

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the people who even pay for or even recommend the product,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and in this case the recommenders were probably

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the line of business management, that is, those users

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
worked for a line of business, a division or a department,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and the influencers, the people who used it, said to their bosses

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
"We'd really like to have this software."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"This would work great."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And their managers, who didn't have any signature authority

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
or couldn't actually install software, recommended that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
this actually get bought.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Understanding this ecosystem is really important

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
not only in business to business sales but sometimes

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
business to consumer sales as well.
