00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's go through it together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're right here in the hotel; we want to get the value of A.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Oh, it's right here; it's 6.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Similarly, if we're right here in the hotel and we want to get the value of B,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we brought one with us; it's 7.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But if we want to get the value of C, do we have it in the hotel?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
No. Okay, let's check back home.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We also don't have it here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay, eventually we'll have to get it from the global environment.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And then finally we want to get the value of X.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Do we have it here in the hotel? No.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Do we have it back at home? Yeah; it's 55.

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And in this example, we never actually got to Pebble Beach. It's a shame.
