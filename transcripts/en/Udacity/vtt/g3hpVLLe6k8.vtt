Let's talk about this.

00:00:02.182 --> 00:00:05.743
Honestly, it really depends
on the size of your data.

00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:10.757
For small amounts of binary data,
very, very small amounts of binary data,

00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:13.771
you could actually put
the raw data in the database.

00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:16.967
There are blob types, and those
are supported and work pretty well.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.507
However, as you start putting
larger data into the database,

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.230
it gets pretty inefficient

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.342
and you end up writing
a lot more code.

00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:26.613
Well, as far as storing the files

00:00:26.613 --> 00:00:28.844
in a public folder
on the device is concerned,

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:32.214
well, that might work if you
actually wanted to share those files.

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:35.615
But, typically, you don't want to share
those files with other applications,

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:39.228
so storing them in a public folder
on the device isn't a very good idea.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.442
But the third option is pretty good.
Storing the files in a private folder

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:47.336
and then referencing
the location in the database.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.386
Now, admittedly, you might not even need
to put them into the database at all.

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:55.372
But it's often nice to do this if you need
to do any kind of queries on them.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:59.270
You can store metadata in your database
and store files in a private folder.

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.150
This is what Android does in the gallery.
