00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.162
let's try answering an easier form of the problem. This might help us think about

00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:07.982
what we should do. How many batches of brownies could you bake if a recipe

00:00:07.994 --> 00:00:12.301
requires 1/2 of a cup of sugar and you have one cup of sugar at home? This seems

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:16.026
a little bit easier. This square is going to represent my one cup of sugar. I

00:00:16.108 --> 00:00:20.276
know 1/2 of a cup of sugar will make one batch of brownies. So I'm going to fill

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:24.855
up 1/2 of my cup and make one batch of brownies. So here's a half cup of sugar

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:29.015
and I know I made one batch of brownies. If I use another half cup of sugar, I

00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:33.075
know I'll make another batch of brownies. Now I've used my one whole cup of

00:00:33.087 --> 00:00:37.065
sugar and I don't have any sugar left at home. Well, I made two batches of

00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:41.533
brownies. Let's try this with some math. I have one cup of sugar. And I wondered

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:45.592
how many times did 1/2 go into it? I knew I was able to make 2 batches of

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:50.124
brownies. So 1 divided by a 1/2 must be 2. Remember, when we divide by a number,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:54.773
we can actually multiply by the reciporical. We learned that from before. So I

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:59.216
could change this to look like 1 times 2 over 1. Well, remember, I could just

00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:04.041
put any number over 1. And then, multiply fractions like before. 1 times 2 is 2,

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:08.551
and 1 times 1 is 1. 2 for 1 is just 2. Let's change this problem a little bit

00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:13.143
and see what we can find out. What if instead a recipe called for 1/3 a cup of

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:17.704
sugar? I know if I use a 3rd cup of sugar I'll make one batch of brownies. If I

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:22.413
use another 1/3 cup of sugar, I'll make another batch of brownies and if I use

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:27.215
my last 1/3 cup of sugar I'll make one more batch of brownies. So let's put this

00:01:27.227 --> 00:01:31.702
with some math. I was wondering how many times does 1/3 go into 1 so I did 1

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:36.028
divided by 1/3. I know that for every 1/3 cup of sugar I get one batch of

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.166
brownies so I should get three batches. Remember when I divide by a number it's

00:01:41.178 --> 00:01:45.604
the same thing as multiply by the reciprocal. I could change this to

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:50.094
multiplication 1 times 3 over 1. I know 1 is just 1 over 1 and now I can

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:54.974
multiply these fractions together. 1 times 3 is 3 and 1 times 1 is 1, I get 3

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:58.938
over 1, 3 divided by 1 is 3 batches. I hope you're starting to see a pattern.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:00.640
Let's see if you can figure this one out.
