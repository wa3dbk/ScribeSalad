00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.780
Congratulations on completing the course. We've covered lots of

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.840
material in this course and there's lots more that we

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.920
couldn't get to. Mobile web development is a huge topic

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.970
and you're probably wondering where to go from here. Now

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.500
that you understand the basic concepts, you probably have

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.860
questions about things like scaffolding and getting started, which libraries

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.530
to use and how to deploy your applications, how to

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.229
really incorporate this knowledge into your day to day work.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.360
To learn more, you can visit HTML5

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.380
Rocks, follow Chrome developers on Google Plus,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.700
and check out the chrome channel on

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.080
Google developers live for more information on dev

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.590
tools. There are many handy tools out

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.134
there that can further streamline your development

00:00:40.134 --> 00:00:42.750
workflow. Yeoman and Grunt for example allow

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.220
you to scaffold and easily build your projects.
