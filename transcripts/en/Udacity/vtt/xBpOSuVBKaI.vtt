00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.630
For higher order roots though, we need to do something a little bit different.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.370
If you remember we had a product rule that let us split up a root of a and b.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.370
If these were factors of a radicand we could split the root up into the nth

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.588
root of a times the nth root of b. Well it turns out there's a similar rule for

00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:19.334
division. The quotient rule let's us take the in root of a fraction we can just

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:24.467
split it up into m through it of a divided by the m through it of b. This means

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:29.366
that the cube root of this fraction becomes the cube root of 27. Divided by the

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:34.490
cubed root of 16. We're just using our quotient rule. We know the cubed root of

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.600
27 will end up being 3, since we can rewrite 27 as 3 cubed. But we can't

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.740
exactly take the cubed root of 16, 16 is 2 to the 4th. We don't want this cubed

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.632
root to appear in the denominator, so we need to rationalize this part. If we

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:51.706
can get this power to be a multiple of 3, then we would be able to take the

00:00:51.706 --> 00:00:56.722
cube root of it. For example, I really want this denominator to become the

00:00:56.722 --> 00:01:00.650
cubed root of 2 to the 6. I can take the cubed root of this, it's just 2

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.680
squared. So when we reationalize the denominator of a higher order root. We

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.645
want to raise the power of each factor of the radicand to be a multiple of the

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:14.542
index of the root. In other words, we want to have powers inside the radical

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:19.320
that are evenly divisible by the index of the root. So, what would be multiply

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.974
this numerator and this denominator by to change our denominator into this

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:28.600
form? Keep in mind that whatever we multiply the denominator by we need to

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.106
multiply the numerator by since we're really just multiplying by a form of 1.
