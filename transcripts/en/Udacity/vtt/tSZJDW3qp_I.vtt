00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.234
Now we need to compare this t-statistic to the t-critical value. Remember that

00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:09.140
to find this we'll need the degrees of freedom, which is the sum of the sample

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.860
sizes minus 2. Another way to look at this is the degrees of freedom of one

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.850
sample plus the degrees of freedom of the other sample. After you find the

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.887
t-critical value, what's our statistical decision? When you calculate the

00:00:22.887 --> 00:00:27.410
t-critcal values, remember that it can either be positive or negative. Just put

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.998
the positive value here and find the t-critical value for an alpha level of

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.601
0.05.
