00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.540
As you can imagine, since data science is being deployed in a wide range of

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.500
fields, data scientists use many different tools, depending on the task at hand.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.480
Two of the most common tools used by data scientists are Numpy and Pandas.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.780
Numpy is popular because it adds support for

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.930
things like multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.870
It also adds a lot of mathematical functions that base python lacks.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.130
Pandas on the other hand, allows us to structure and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.850
manipulate our data in ways that are particularly well suited for data analysis.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.110
If you happen to be familiar with the scripting language R,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.610
Pandas takes a lot of the best elements from R and implements them in Python.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.770
Both Numpy and Pandas are popular tools in the data science world, so

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.290
being familiar with them will help you read other people's code in the future.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.042
Why don't we quickly discuss a couple of the more important features in both

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:49.733
Numpy and Pandas?
