00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next thing we're going to learn about is how do we parse XML?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, I'm not going make you write an actual parser.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I think there's actually probably a whole class in Udacity learning how to do almost exactly that.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
What I'm going to show you how to do is use the built-in parser in Python.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Python has a library called "minidom," and you can get it by saying something like this:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, one thing I would like to point out real quick here is when you're working with XML

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you'll often see this word "dom" up here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What this stands for is "document object model."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This basically refers to the internal representation of an XML document.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In Python you would have an object that has a list of children,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and each of these children is some sort of tag object,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and a tag object may have a name and an attribute and contents and that sort of thing.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Any time you're dealing with XML programmatically,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
you'll see references to a dom,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
or if you're working in your browser, you'll see references to "the dom,"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which kind of refers to the document, the HTML that you're manipulating programmatically.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In this particular case we're going to use minidom.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Why is it called minidom and not something else?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Well, "mini" kind of implies that this is a smaller, lightweight version of this dom parser.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Actually, parsing XML is actually a really complicated thing, because you can get XML

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that is many, many gigabytes large sometimes.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Parsing all of that text is nontrivial.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But when you're only parsing a little bit of text, you can use this library minidom,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which is basically simple and fast and will break if you throw lots and lots of gigabytes of text at it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but for our purposes will work just great.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm not going to quiz you on this sort of stuff. Just kind of carry this with you.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Dom refers to the computer representation of the XML,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and minidom is a handy library for manipulating this stuff in Python.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now I will show you how to use it. Here we are in Python.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm going to give you a little demo of minidom before you start using it on your own.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
&gt;From xml.dom import minidom.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now we have our minidom.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Minidom has a function on it called "parseString,"

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
which is a function for just parsing a string of XML.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Let's go ahead and give that a whirl.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I've typed up some example HTML.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We have an opening , some text, an opening tag--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
remember these tag names I'm just making up.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
HTML has specific tags that you need to use.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
XML you can have whatever arbitrary tags you want.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's up to the people reading and writing the XML to agree on the tag names.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I created some items--item 1, item 2.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I closed my tag and I closed my .

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, when I was typing this, I had a little typo here, and I'm kind of curious to see what happens.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Let's go ahead and run this with the typo and see--oh, boy! [chuckles]

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So I ran this with the typo to see what would happen, and we get an error--a mismatched tag.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That kind of makes sense.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We have an opening "chilrdren" and a closing "children."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Let's just make this proper.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Okay, we're going to run this without the type, and I'm going to store it in a variable

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
so I have access to it. I'll call it x.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
All right. This time no exception.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
If we were to take a peak at x, we can see we have this minidom document instance.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Let's take a peak at what we have on x.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Holy smokes! Look at all this stuff.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
There is a lot of interesting things here in x.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It looks like appendchild, functions for manipulating the document,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
all this creating nodes, and stuff like that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Some lookup functions--these are what we're going to be using later--

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
getElementById, getElementByTagName. NS refers to a name space.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
All sorts of stuff--parentNode, some output functions.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Toprettyxml--this is actually an interesting one, so let's play with this one.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This is one I use all the time.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
If we were to take our document object and call "toprettyxml" on it--toprettyxml.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This actually doesn't look very pretty, does it, at all?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Let's print that, because this is the Python string with the new lines in it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
If we were to actually print it, it would look a lot prettier.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Here is the xml that I entered, and you can see the structure of the document.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It indents it nicely for us. That's a handy little function.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
When you download XML from somewhere you can see the structure of it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
a little bit more clearly with prettyxml.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Okay, there's a function I'd like to show you here.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Get elements by a tag name.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Now, if I were to run this function on our x object and give it mytag,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
it returns one dom element.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
If I were to run it on item, we actually get two dom elements.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Looking at the first tag called "item," we can see that we have an item.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If we were to look at its children, we can call child nodes

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to see a list of children. We can see that we have one text node.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
If we were to look at the first one of those, we can access the node value attribute

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and see that it's 1.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now, remember our pretty printed version of our XML.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
What we just did here was we said get me all of the elements that are called item.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Here is 1, and here is 2.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
On this first one, which is this guy here, get me its first child,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
which is basically this node here, which isn't strictly a node,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but in minidom it's represented as a text node,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
which is basically just this text content.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Different libraries may handle contents differently, but in minidom this is how we get it.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Then we can actually say get the value of that text node.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That's how we got the number 1 right there.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
This u basically means that's a unicode string.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Minidom assumed that we were entering a unicode string, which is fine.
