00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.700
Next, we delve into the technologies
that power real word HIT systems.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.880
You've now heard of one of them,
data standards,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.130
when we looked at ICD codes and
their role in the HR certification.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.750
You've also heard hints of
the importance of the other two,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.070
technologies for assuring privacy,
security, and trust, and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.290
for supporting health
information exchange.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.560
We now begin a three lesson sequence
in which we'll cover these in

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.100
the reverse order to which
I've just introduce them,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.180
beginning with health
information exchange.
