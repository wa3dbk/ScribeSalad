00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.680
First off notation wise, they correspond to the concrete operations.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.260
We're going to have variables Q sub 1,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.160
Q sub 2, so on, to correspond to the abstract ones which were the Ps.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.900
And similarly to correspond to the abstract state which was indicated by s.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.610
We're going to have the concrete state indicated by t as

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.810
a typical concrete state element. And capital T as the set of concrete states.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.650
And then, the interesting one is that we're going to introduce a function,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.920
a retrieve function. Here, I'm using retr as an abbreviation for it. And it's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.185
going to map from concrete states to abstract ones. That is, retrieve on some t,

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:46.800
concrete state t, is going to be corresponding to some abstract state s.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.350
And it's always going to be the case that, t goes to a single s.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.202
However, it might be the case that different ts go to the same s.

00:00:55.202 --> 00:00:59.540
You kind of expect that because at the lower level we have more details. And so,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.150
we can get into more states. But

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.790
those states are going to map into a fewer number of abstract states.
