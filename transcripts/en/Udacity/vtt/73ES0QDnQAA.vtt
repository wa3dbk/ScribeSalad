00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Our newfound mastery of environments puts us in a perfect place

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to write interpreter code for declaring and calling functions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
However, there's a lot more to functions than just environments.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, someone could be a little mean and give us a procedure like this

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to try to interpret.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Mean of x immediately returns x, but then after that it has written print

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"one thousand and one nights".

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We should never actually print out "one thousand and one nights"

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from this function definition.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We should return first.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That's a shame because One Thousand and One Nights is perhaps the best-known example

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of Arabic literature, a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
One of my particular favorite parts are the stories involving Sindbad the Sailor.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Unfortunately, his luck fluctuates wildly.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
More on Sindbad perhaps later on.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The meaning of this is we need a way to return without doing any more work.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let's get a better feel for this with a bit of a puzzle.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Here I've written a bit of Python code, and I have 4 assignment statements involving x.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What I'd like you to do is imagine that these assignment statements are not there.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But you get to add one of them in, and your goal is to try to add in a statement

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that will prevent us from printing out "sindbad".

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So again, assume these statements aren't there,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but which ones could you move in to prevent "sindbad" from being printed?

00:01:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Multiple multiple choice. Check all that apply.
