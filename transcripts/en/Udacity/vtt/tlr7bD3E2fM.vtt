00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.904
When Athena talks about the possible area's of the fun room to other people at

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.930
the architecture firm, she's probably not going to want to talk about any values

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.966
of x that aren't allowed. She'll really only want to focus on the ones that are

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:17.439
in the domain. In the set of allowed possible values for x or inputs. As we said

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.892
earlier, the domain of this function is x is greater than 0, because of the

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:26.728
restrictions placed upon it by the real life situation it's representing. As

00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:30.696
we've learned throughout the class, one of the best ways to visualize most

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:35.080
things in math is through graphing, and domain is no exception. Looking at what

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.070
I have plotted here, we can see that the only points on our graph have x

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.679
coordinates that lie within this domain. It's a little bit hard to see here, but

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.095
rather than having a filled in circle at the point 0,0 there's actually a tiny

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:52.365
little open circle, just like we saw in number lines before. The fact that

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:56.781
there's an open circle at this end point is just showing that this end point is

00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.290
not included in the domain. If instead we've had x is greater than or equal to

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.668
0, this would be a filled in circle, but we don't. And of course we could also

00:01:05.668 --> 00:01:09.809
write our domain in interval notation. X lies in the range 0 to infinity not

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:11.408
including either end point.
