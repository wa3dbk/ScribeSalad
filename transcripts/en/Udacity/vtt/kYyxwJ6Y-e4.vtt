We know if this factorable, there must be factors of a times c which sum to our

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:09.644
middle coefficient b. We know this because if we can factor this, it would be

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:15.610
in this form. This first term ax squared comes from multiplying ax times cx.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.560
And our last term c comes from multiplying B times D. The middle term bx comes

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.175
from multiplying Ax times D. And adding to that, B times Cx. We distribute the

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:33.386
Ax twice, and we distribute the B twice. And really, all of these different

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:36.387
variables represent real numbers.
