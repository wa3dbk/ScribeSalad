00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.466
Now, suppose you have an object of a class that implements the drawable

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:09.108
interface. For example, a house, then you can save it in a variable whose type

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:15.580
is the interface. And that intuitively makes sense, a house, is a kind of

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.084
drawable. Now that solves our problem. because similarly, we can make an

00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:28.030
ArrayList of drawables, and this ArrayList now can hold dogs, houses, whatever.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.452
You simply take any object of any class that implements the drawable interface,

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:38.739
and you add it to the ArrayList. It works, because you can convert from a dog,

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:46.010
to a drawable which is what this ArrayList holds. In our same class, we can

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.220
replace these three ArrayLists with a single one, an ArrayList of drawable. Go

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.876
ahead and do that. When you're done, you should have just one ArrayList into

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:06.321
which you add three cars, two houses, and three dogs. And down here, you should

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:11.991
have just one loop. Of course, you also need to make sure that the car, house,

00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:17.491
and dog classes all implement the drawable interface.
