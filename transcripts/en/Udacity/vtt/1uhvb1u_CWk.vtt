00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.150
Today we'll talk about
incremental concept learning.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.420
In case based reasoning,
we're storing new examples in memory.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.400
Today we'll talk about how we can
abstract concepts out of those examples.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.880
This is our second major
topic of learning.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.940
We'll start with the learning goal.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.300
Then we'll talk about very near spaces
of learning like variabilization,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.919
specialization, and generalization.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.480
We'll also talk about heuristics for
specializing and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.530
generalizing concepts as
examples come in incrementally.
