00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.070
It turns out that interval II is false and interval III is true. Let's see why.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.077
I think for the second interval, the easiest number to check would be x equals

00:00:08.077 --> 00:00:11.976
0. If we let x equals 0, then we know that we'll have negative 12 is greater

00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:17.663
than 0. We know this is a false statement. So, this means that none of the

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:24.510
values between negative 3 and positive 4 would satisfy our original inequality.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.906
We would exclude these values from our solution set. For interval III, I'm

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:33.704
going to choose the number x equals 5. Now, you could have chosen any number,

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:37.870
like six, eight, ten, even 14. You just want to choose one number to test in

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.629
this interval to see if it makes our inequality statement true. So plug in x

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.606
equal 5. I get the statement 8 is greater than 0. I know this is true, which

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:52.828
means that all of these numbers satisfy our original condition. Great work if

00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:56.260
you found this to be false and this interval to be true.
