Our cerebrum is composed of four large areas called lobes, which each carry out

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:10.370
distinct functions. Our four lobes are frontal, parietal, occipital and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.548
temporal. These lobes are bilateral, which means that they are located on the

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:21.862
left and the right sides of the brain. We should also point out that all of the

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:26.548
structures of the forebrain, the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala,

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:33.105
and the cingulated gyrus, are bilateral. Meaning they exist in twos. On the

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:34.759
right, and on the left.
