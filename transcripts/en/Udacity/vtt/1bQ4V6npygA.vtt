00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.912
So, with some logic and some algebra, we can come up with two equations for this

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:07.758
problem. We used the individual amounts from each account to equal the total

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:11.333
amount. And we used the interest rates and those amounts to get our total

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.289
interest. Now that we have two equations, we can use them to figure out how much

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.028
was invested at each rate. I'm going to show you how to solve the system using

00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:24.457
substitution. I think it's easier than elimination because I can either isolate

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:29.498
the x in this first equation or the y. If I subtract x from both sides, I can

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:34.488
solve for y. So y would equal 10,000 minus x. Now that y is solved for, I can

00:00:34.488 --> 00:00:39.469
replace this y with 10,000 minus x, this is my substitution. I've made the

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.411
substitution in this line, the I distribute the 0.08. Multiplying by 10,000

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:49.099
moves my decimal point right four places, so I get 800. And then I have minus

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:53.908
0.08 times x for the second term. Next I subtract 800 from both sides. I have my

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:58.852
constant terms on the right, and then my x terms on the left. Next, I combine my

00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:03.691
like terms and I get negative 0.005 times x. Then, I divide by the coefficient

00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:08.676
of x to get x is equal to 2,500. But we need to make sense of what this means.

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:13.857
Let's look back at our problem. X is 2,500. Well, that's the amount of money I

00:01:13.857 --> 00:01:18.692
invested at 7.5%. Knowing this, I want you to finish out the rest of this

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:23.621
problem. How much was invested at 8%? Write your answer here.
