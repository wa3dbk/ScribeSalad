00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.450
All right, we're looking at RecordSoundsViewController right now.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.570
And what I've done here,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.530
is that I've embedded the code that we saw in the previous video in this file.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.690
Let me walk you through it.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.300
First I imported AVFoundation, and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.300
then I declared an object of AVAudioRecorder, globally.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.990
Then I added all of the code from the previous video,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.120
to the record audio function.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.250
This includes a print statement, which will print the name and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.980
the part of the file where we have recorded our voice.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.030
Now while I'm at it, let me add code to the Stop Audio function also.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.750
Here I will stop the audioRecorder, and then deactivate the audio session.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.990
I encourage you to Google and

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.990
figure out why we need to add these two lines to our code.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.820
By the way, all of this code that we have added in this file,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.260
is available in the instructor notes for you to play with.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.500
All right. I'm going to run my project.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.950
So now when I hit the Record button,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.100
I get a print statement here in the debug area of my x code.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.090
This seems like the file name with the current date stamp that has been printed.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.010
Today is November 4th, 2014, and it's just past 12 p.m where I am.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.550
So it seems like the file name is correct.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.350
Okay, let me try this one more time and see if the time stamp actually changes.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.591
There.

00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:14.420
And it seems like it does.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.480
The time stamp now is looking at 12 p.m, 2 minutes and 36 seconds.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.950
One last thing to notice here,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.830
is that even though we've been able to successfully print the name of the file,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.330
we still don't know if our audio is being recorded successfully.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.420
Let's find out more about that in the next video.
