00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.830
The first model we want to discuss is the grandfather of

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.900
all life cycle models. And it is the waterfall model. In

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.890
the waterfall model the project progresses to an orderly sequence of

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.040
steps. From the initial software concept, down until the final phase.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.110
Which is system testing. And at the end of each phase

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.510
there will be a review to determine whether the project is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.120
ready to advance to the next phase. The pure waterfall model

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.340
performs well for softer products in which there is a stable

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.400
product definition. The domain is well known and the technologies

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.220
involved are well understood. In these kind of domains, the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.350
waterfall model helps you to find errors in the early,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.180
local stages of the projects. If you remember what we discussed,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.950
this is the place where we want to find errors,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.440
not down here because finding them here will reduce the cost

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.160
of our overall software development. The main advantage of the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.930
waterfall model is that it allows you to find errors early.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.910
However, the main disadvantages of the waterfall model arise

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.550
from the fact that it is not flexible. Normally,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.520
it is difficult to fully specify requirements at the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.470
beginning of a project. And this lack of flexibility is

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.800
far from ideal when dealing with project in which

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.310
requirements change, the developers are not domain experts or

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.130
the technology used are new and evolving, that is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.440
it is less than ideal for most real world projects.
