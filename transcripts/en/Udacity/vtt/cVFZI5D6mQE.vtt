00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.790
&gt;&gt; Now the output from texture packers is actually going to be a JSON file. We

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.755
will need to load and parse the data in this file, in order to render all our

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:11.995
sprites on the screen properly. Now, for each chart in the atlas, the JSON file

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:16.085
lists a nice set of data, that allows us to understand more about this chart.

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:20.023
For our purposes, we're really only concerned with two things. The first, being

00:00:20.023 --> 00:00:23.642
the name of this chart. Now, this was the name of the original loose asset

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.497
before it was packed inside of our atlas. And secondly, is the data here in the

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:31.568
frame parameter. Now, frame has 4 items that we actually care about. The first

00:00:31.568 --> 00:00:35.741
two, x and y, represent the top left corner of the chart inside of the atlas.

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:39.842
The next two are width and height, which represent the size of this chart in the

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:43.782
atlas itself. Now, we're going to use all 4 of these values to actually draw

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:47.727
this chart to our canvas. Now, we've given you a sample data file to parse

00:00:47.727 --> 00:00:51.782
that's actually part of the grid scheme. What we'd like you to do is use this

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:56.137
data to load the assets into our sample by filling out the parseAtlasDefinition

00:00:56.137 --> 00:00:58.175
function in the sprite sheet class.
