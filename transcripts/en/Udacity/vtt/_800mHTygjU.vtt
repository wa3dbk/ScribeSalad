00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.870
I'm back with Kaushik from Locket again,
and

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.570
this time we're going to be discussing
the challenges of measuring things.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.890
So Kaushik, when you were
measuring different metrics,

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.220
what sort of barriers or
obstacles did you encounter?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, well,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.129
user retention rate was one of the most
difficult things to measure for us.

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:23.506
Especially because a lot of users
actually installed our application,

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:27.910
never used it, but because it
was there on the lock screen we

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.189
miscalculated them as
always using users.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.425
Or we calibrated their retention
rates to be very positive and

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:41.100
very supportive, but in reality they
totally forgot about our application.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.970
They did not even know that our
application existed over there,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.960
because it was very native and
that's how it was.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.010
So that was very difficult for
us to measure.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.632
We had already a unique way of
measuring the user retention rate.

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.360
We'd considered the user engagement
as well as we considered,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.980
we had a few set of metrics,
which they had to hit every single day

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.580
in order to make sure that they
are using the app consistently.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.621
So that was one challenging part.

00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:08.131
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.377
And what do you think will
be most important for

00:01:10.377 --> 00:01:13.669
the company moving forward,
in terms of metrics and measurement?

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:14.828
&gt;&gt; Well, first,

00:01:14.828 --> 00:01:20.500
drop off between day 7 to day 14 is
one of the most important metric.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.070
And then number of invites
each user is sending, and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.633
the number of people who
are positively responding for

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:31.400
those invites as well as number,
their respective retention rates and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.060
then how the total,
the chain reaction is working.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.730
For example, if we buy users
off someone from Facebook or

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.910
if we buy users from different
sources' headquarters.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.348
So we want to measure this complete
chain as to how much vital coefficient

00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:50.398
it is adding and stuff like that.

00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:52.650
So that's one of the most
important things.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.390
&gt;&gt; So tell me a little bit about how
you guys go about measuring things and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.280
how did the product
inform what you measured?

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.641
And the metrics that you chose,

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.969
that you thought were important
to track as a company.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.280
&gt;&gt; Right, so we mainly measured
metrics around two broad areas.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.260
One is user retention rate and
user engagement rate.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.336
So user retention rate means day
1 retention, day 7 retention and

00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:17.130
day 14 retention.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.200
And as we are on lock screen we
are all the time on the screen, and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.280
it is really difficult to find whether
he is using it or no, and he just forgot

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.360
about the application after installing,
because it is right on the lock screen.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.928
So user engagement is also
very important metric,

00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:34.890
where we measure how many
times he is liking animation.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.410
How many times he is sending
animation to his friends,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.590
or is he receiving images?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.400
All these things, so
in the beginning we actually

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.660
thought day one retention rate
was very important for this.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.466
But over a period of time, we realized
that it's not day 1 retention rate,

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:53.868
it's a drop off from day 7 to day 14,
which is highly important.

00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:58.769
Because day one retention rate
actually was the retention rate

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.310
provided by users who might not
have had friends in Screenpop.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.380
But day 7 and
day 14 retention rates were mostly

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.320
around who already had
friends in Screenpop,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.730
so they were the people who
actually sent a lot of invites.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.230
They were the people who sent a lot
of messages, as well as images,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.160
to their friends.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.880
So, measuring those were
highly critical for us.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.380
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow.
