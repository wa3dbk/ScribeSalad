00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.930
Welcome back.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.990
In this lesson, you'll be developing
your very own portfolio page,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.500
which you'll be able to
share with the world.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.870
I know the layout looks different than
what you did before in the first lesson,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.050
but don't worry.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.160
I'll be helping you with an approach
that will make your life easier

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.260
by creating a CSS framework that you can
use in this project, in future projects.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.360
You'll be able to make beautiful
pages like this without any problem.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.980
Along the way, you'll be developing your
portfolio following responsive design

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.300
principles, which means that your
website is going to look great for

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.870
everyone, regardless of their device.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.590
Are you ready to get started?
