00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:05.919
The functions on graph A are even functions and the functions on graph B are odd

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:11.062
functions. This correlates, as we can see, with the powers that each of these

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:17.207
functions have. Over here, our powers are 2, 4, and 6, and over here, they're 1,

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:21.848
3, and 5. These are odd number powers and these are even number powers.
