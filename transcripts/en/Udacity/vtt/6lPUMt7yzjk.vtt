00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.376
Though when we zoom in and look at graphs, we're really only seeing part of the

00:00:03.376 --> 00:00:07.808
entire representation of the function. We're just zooming in on this little

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:11.662
tiny portion of the domain. If we zoom out even just a bit though, we can see

00:00:11.662 --> 00:00:16.420
that all these changes that are happening in the middle of the graph. Are

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.720
really just tiny details the overall behavior of the function is determined by

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.820
what's happening at either end of the graph on the right side and on the left

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.130
side. We've already learned a lot about the general shape of polynomial

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.245
functions so let's see if you can apply what you've learned. To work out how

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:35.222
each of these graphs will look. For each function I've listed here please tell

00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:39.292
me what the behavior on the left side of the graph is going to look like. In

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:43.330
other words, what direction the graph is coming from? And then also tell me

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.930
what's happening on the right side of the graph. What direction is the graph

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.439
pointing in as we move over to the right hand side?
