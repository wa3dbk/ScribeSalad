00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.520
When you first have an idea for
a game, it's often pretty complex.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.410
You might imagine a story with lots of
interesting graphics and enemies, but

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.220
the core of the game is
usually very simple.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.930
And this core is the first
thing you want to test out

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.030
before you distribute your
game to a wider audience.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.140
You want to make sure your
game foundation is strong,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.690
by testing it out with
a small group of players.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.580
To test your game core, you need
to create a minimum viable product

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.280
which is the simplest most
focused version of your game.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.330
Minimum means it contains
the minimum amount of features

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.720
that encapsulate the game,
no extra levels or graphics.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.790
Let's look at some a examples
of a minimum viable product.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.580
Consider the game Megatroid which is a
platformer a game where you jump through

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.070
stages, getting upgrades and shooting
robot enemies to advance levels.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.460
You can even generate
your own playable levels.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.750
This game has a lot of fun features, but

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.530
what do we need in
the minimum viable product?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.660
Level creation?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.710
No.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.690
Enemies?

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.880
No.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.450
Weapon upgrades, or even weapons at all?

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.250
No.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.620
These are all extra features that
can be added later in the game.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.600
To test the foundation of the game,
we need to remove all the enemies,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.960
items and extra levels,
all the things that are nice to have but

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.590
not necessary to have.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.940
And what we're left with is
a single jumping platform game.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.660
To make a Megatroid
minimum viable product, I

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.890
would include just a single level where
I can move and jump and fall into pits.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.860
I might also include an easy restart for
the game.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.120
This defines the basic
structure of my game.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.570
These are the minimum needed features,
and

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.740
they're the most important to perfect.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.500
We want to test this version out and

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.640
make sure that the game movement is as
smooth and high quality as possible.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.890
Then we can add enemies and
upgrades later on.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.720
So when you're thinking about what to
include in your minimum viable product,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.050
think about what features are needed for
your game to be entertaining and

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.910
what can be added later.
