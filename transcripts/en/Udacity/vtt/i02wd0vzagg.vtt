00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right, before we actually write a code that carries out this procedure, let's do an example.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here's a lovely heap. In fact, well, I just covered this up.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a lovely heap where each of the nodes is smaller or no larger than any of its children,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
except for this pesky 50 at the root.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Using what I described in the previous slide what we're just talking about,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you can actually patch this up by moving the 50 around doing some various swaps.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In fact, you have do do a series of swaps.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And when the swapping is all done, which node in the tree, according to the red numbering,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which node is going to be the resting place of 50 once the heap property is established?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Just write the node number where 50 ends up in the box.
