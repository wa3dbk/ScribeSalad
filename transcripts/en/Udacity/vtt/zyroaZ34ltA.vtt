00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.830
In the last lesson, we saw how we can leverage visual encodings to

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.710
effectively represent and present data.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.350
Think of visual encodings as building blocks of graphics.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.950
These are components that we can combine in creative ways to

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.270
construct a visualization.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.580
An analogy can be drawn to how we communicate information through text.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.180
When writing prose or an article, you construct sentences and

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.159
a narrative through using different parts of speech.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.740
So try to think of the different visual encodings we've covered.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.700
As the nouns, verbs and adjectives of graphics
