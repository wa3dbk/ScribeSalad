00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.690
One of the approaches to
unify the production and

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.020
development environments
is called a golden image.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.860
The idea is to take the operating
system, libraries, and

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.930
our application itself, and
wrap them up in a standard or

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.930
golden master image of a virtual
machine that can be used and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.560
reused without the need to configure
each new machine individually.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.450
These golden images can be used both
on desktop workstations as a virtual

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.610
machine and on servers.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.570
You can also create golden
images of containers.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.680
Another approach is to just install
a base operating system and then use

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.450
a configuration management system that
performs automatic installation and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.720
configuration of software on
every machine under its control,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.010
thus making sure that all the machines
have the same configuration.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.280
To be sure of that, the installation
should start from the same base OS image

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.690
otherwise there could be
OS level differences.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.640
The difference is that a golden image
system requires more work upfront, and

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.540
has to be regenerated whenever
there are any changes.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.790
But once it's done, it is very fast to
boot up a new server or VM with it.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.100
With the configuration management
system on the other hand,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.209
booting up will be slower because every
machines needs to install the same

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.360
software on the first boot.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.980
However, if there is a configuration
change, it's easy and fast to get these

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.460
changes out to the machines without
the need to regenerate the image.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.500
And, of course,
you can have something in between.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.600
For instance, install the base software
and libraries, perform the main

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.510
configuration, create a golden image and
then use it to bring up the machines.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.700
Then once they're up,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.870
use a configuration management system
to perform smaller rolling updates.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.370
If both the image creation and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.800
configuration management
processes are automated and

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.840
in a version control system,
it's easy to reproduce these steps.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.480
And that's what you'll do as
the first step in this project.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.780
Build a golden image that has all
the software necessary for dove and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.330
also works in the cloud for
production server.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.220
You won't work with a configuration
management system in this project

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.940
because that topic would require
a whole course of its own.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.900
Maybe later.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.340
For now, you'll have to download and
install a couple of programs.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.950
