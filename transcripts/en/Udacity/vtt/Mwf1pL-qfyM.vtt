00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.620
Try rationalizing these denominators. When we rationalize a denominator, we

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.760
want to multiply by something so it eliminates the radical in the denominator.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.108
So what do you think we need to multiply each of these fractions by, and what

00:00:13.108 --> 00:00:15.383
would be the final result?
