00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.260
Now try the same thing for this scenario. Matthew forgot his bus pass at home,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.116
and when he was about to get on the bus, he realized this. He became very

00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:13.755
upset, and this caused a negative emotional reaction. While walking to school,

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:17.451
instead of riding the bus, he thought more carefully about the situation. And

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:21.964
realized that at he least he didn't lose the bus pass, it was safely at home.

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:25.844
So, he didn't have to spend money to replace it. Also, he realized that it was

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:30.364
good to get outside and enjoy some exercise on his walk to school. Identify the

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:33.658
part of this scenario that was a primary appraisal and the part there was a

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.980
secondary appraisal. Type your responses in these two boxes.
