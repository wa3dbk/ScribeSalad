The main difference between worms and viruses is that, worms can spread

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.970
automatically by scanning for vulnerable hosts

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.980
and spreading. Whereas viruses typically require

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.450
user intervention to spread. Such as clicking on an executable file in an email

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.700
attachment or installing a particular program from a USB stick.
