00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:06.710
Okay, so, finding the largest value in a set is something which uses what's called a reduction.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.477
It's a parallel algorithm, and it is in fact a bulk parallel algorithm,

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:17.489
so that is yes. In this case, you're summing repeatedly between threads to find who has the greatest element

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.992
and reducing that down to a single element, which is the largest of them all.

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:25.662
This is actually very similar to summing elements of an array.

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:29.165
This is called a parallel reduction, and it's something you've probably seen before

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:32.403
that is also a bulk parallel algorithm that works on the same lines.

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:37.070
Adding two strings together, however, is not a bulk parallel algorithm

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.570
because you have to work your way to the end of the first string and then add character by character

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.944
the elements of the second string. This is a serial operation,

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.658
and so it would not be something that you could do with a large number of threads together,

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:50.351
so it is not bulk parallel algorithm.
