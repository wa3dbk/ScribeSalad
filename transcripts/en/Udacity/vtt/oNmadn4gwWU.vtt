In IPSec, there are two operation modes.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.020
In transport mode,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.170
security protection is provided to
traffic from one end host to another.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.880
That is, it is an end to end protection.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.060
In tunnel mode, security protection
is typically provided to traffic from

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.110
gateway of a network to
the gateway of another network.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.920
This is how the so called virtual
private network, or VPN, is implemented.
