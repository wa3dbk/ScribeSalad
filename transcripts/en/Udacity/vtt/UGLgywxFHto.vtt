00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.982
We've seen direct variation and we've seen inverse variation, but these two

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:09.552
don't have to be separate. There are times when the quantities can vary jointly.

00:00:09.552 --> 00:00:12.976
In other words, we'll have more than just two amounts related to each other. An

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:17.376
example of this would be simple interest that accrues over time. Simple interest

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:21.687
is equal to the principal amount we start with times the interest rate. The

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:26.379
amount of interest that accumulates in one year is dependent, or varies directly

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:31.166
with these other two values. If the principal amount were to go up, our interest

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:35.463
would also go up. Likewise, if we increase the interest rate, our interest would

00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:40.844
go up as well. So this is a case of joint variation. Because simple interest

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:45.068
varies directly with both the principal amount and the interest rate, we could

00:00:45.068 --> 00:00:48.946
set up a proportion like this. The principal amount and the interest rate

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:53.050
associated with our first interest would appear directly across from it. So if

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.145
we had any five of these quantities, we could solve for the remaining one, or

00:00:57.145 --> 00:01:01.196
the one that's left out. Let's see if you can use this idea of joint variation

00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:02.793
to solve a different problem.
