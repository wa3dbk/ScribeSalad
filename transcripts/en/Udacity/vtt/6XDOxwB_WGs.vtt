Comparing each x value to the one that came before it, as we move down our

00:00:04.903 --> 00:00:10.294
table, every entry is one greater than the one that came before it. If we do the

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:15.262
same thing to the y side of the table, we notice that every value is three

00:00:15.274 --> 00:00:20.511
greater than the one before it. So, when x changes by 1, positive 1, y changes

00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:21.433
by positive 3.
