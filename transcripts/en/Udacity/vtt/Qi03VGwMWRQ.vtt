00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.757
So here's the answer. The first one is true. S

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:07.250
index 3 is exactly the same thing as S index

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.640
1 plus 1 plus 1 because 1 plus 1, plus

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.410
1 evaluates to 3. These two have the same value.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.330
If S is a string with at least 4 characters

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.940
in it, this will get the fourth character from S.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.420
If s has fewer than 4 characters, both of these

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
will produce an error. The second choice, both of these actually

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.860
also have the same value. S index 0 will get

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.150
us the first character of S as long as S

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.530
has at least one character; otherwise it will produce an

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.390
error. S plus Swill produce the string, concatenating S with itself

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.270
but its first character is still the same as the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.470
first character of S, so these two are equivalent. The third

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.590
option is not equivalent. So here we're taking the first

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.620
character of S, concatenating that with the second character of S.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.510
Here we're taking from S, the 0 plus 1th

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.650
character, which is, evaluates to 1 so that's the

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.190
second character of S. This is just going to be

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.640
one character, this is two characters. They're never equivalent. The

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.270
fourth option is sometimes equivalent. If S is a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.165
string with at least two characters then S index

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:12.940
1 is the second character from S. S plus

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.410
ity index 1 is the second character for S. The

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.330
problem is that if S has less than two characters. So suppose our value of S was

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.196
just a one letter string. S index 1 will

00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:29.230
be an error. There is no second character from

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.260
S. S plus ity index 1 would be the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.240
second character of the string that resolves from that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.340
concatenation which would actually be the I. So these

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.430
are not always equivalent. They are equivalent in the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.040
case where S has at least two characters.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.170
The final option, we have S negative 1,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.210
so that means the last character of S. And we have S plus S, which produces

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.850
the string which concatenates S with itself in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.610
X negative 1. That's going to be the last

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.510
character of concatenating S with itself, which is

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.240
the same as the last character of S.
