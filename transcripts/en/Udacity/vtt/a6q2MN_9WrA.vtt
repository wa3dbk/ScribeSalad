00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.494
Another distinct way we can remember information is through Schemas. We can

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:08.134
define Schemas as a mental framework that develops from our experiences with

00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:12.588
particular people, objects or events. In other words you can think of schemas

00:00:12.588 --> 00:00:16.608
as framework for representing some aspects of the world. That tells us how

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:21.418
people, objects or events are most likely to look like or act like. Schemas

00:00:21.418 --> 00:00:25.948
influence our attention, and the absorption of new knowledge. In fact, we're

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:29.547
more likely to notice things that fit into our schema once we have a schema

00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:34.728
formed. So they help us to understand and organize experiences. They can also

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:38.568
aid in our memory and recall. However, it's important to note that schemas have

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:42.751
a tendency to remain unchanged. Even if we're presented with new information

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.162
that contradicts our schema. Let's say you have a schema of a college

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:50.270
professor, that is, you have a conceptual idea of what a professor looks like.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.214
Perhaps if they're a man or a woman, how old they are. How tall they are or how

00:00:54.214 --> 00:00:58.940
they dress. So, it may be that someone's schema for a professor is that they're

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.560
old. They wear sports jackets with patches in the elbows, they have glasses,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.220
they carry a briefcase, they're male and other identifying features of a

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.737
professor. So, if that's a person's schema for a professor, research shows that

00:01:12.737 --> 00:01:16.580
if he or she is presented with new information that is contradictory of that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.902
schema. For example, if being a young woman who dresses rather casually,

00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:26.752
carrying a back pack rather than a brief case and so on. The person with the

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:30.356
developed schema will be less likely to remember the female professor. So

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:34.325
schemas can aid in our ability to remember, but they also bias our memory and

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:36.329
our perception.
