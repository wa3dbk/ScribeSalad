00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.484
This side lenght is 3 times the square root of 39. Great problem solving for

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:10.444
getting that one right. Now 7, 24, 25 is a special right triangle that we could

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:17.300
use. But since this hypotenuse isn't 25, we won't use that. Instead, we'll just

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.570
need to use the Pythagorean Theorem. A squared plus b squared equals c squared.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.962
In this case, 7 is the leg, 20 is the hypotenuse, since it's across from the

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:33.446
right angle, and x is the unknown leg we're trying to find. So, we'll have 7

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:39.764
squared plus x squared equals 20 squared. Squaring 7, we get 49 and squaring

00:00:39.764 --> 00:00:46.283
20, we'll get 400. Next, we'll subtract 49 from both sides to get 1x squared

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:50.962
equals 351. We take the square root of both sides keeping only the positive

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:57.564
root. So, x is equal to the square root of 351. We can simplify this square

00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:03.104
root by breaking it into 3 times 117. Then, we break it down one more time, to

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:09.269
get 3 times 3 times 39. We have a repeated factor of 3. So, a 3 comes outside

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:15.296
of our square root, and 39 stays inside. This gives us our final answer of 3

00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:18.283
times the square root of 39.
