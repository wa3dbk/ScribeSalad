00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's look at the solution to
our flat page table size quiz.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.930
We are asked what the total size of
the page tables in the system is.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.500
There are two processes in the system,
so there will be two page tables.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.345
We need to add up their sizes.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:15.635
The page size is 4 kilobytes.

00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:19.135
The applications have a 32-bit
virtual address space.

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:24.425
So we have 2 processes times 2
to the 32nd bytes of address

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:28.317
space divided by 2 to
the 12 bytes in a page.

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:35.497
This is how many pages we have times
the size of an entry is 8 bytes,

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:40.562
which gives us two times
eight is 16 x 2 to the 20th.

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:48.050
2 to the 20th bytes is a megabyte,
So we have 16 megabytes.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.200
Note that it didn't matter how much
memory the processes are actually using.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.140
The flat page table needs to have
an entry for every possible page

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.740
in the virtual address space, not only
for the pages we are actually using.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.270
Also, it doesn't matter how much
physical memory we actually have.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.050
What matters is what
the size of the entry is.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.820
So for example, this entry was
designed to accommodate up to a 64-bit

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.260
physical address, even though the system
actually has much less memory.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.540
Why would you do this?

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.000
Well, because you want to build
the system such that it can expand its

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.810
memory if necessary, for example,
by adding more memory modules.
