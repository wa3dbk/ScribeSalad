00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.252
Now that we've seen a couple of different transformations, let's look at

00:00:03.252 --> 00:00:08.118
several at once. Each of these equations represents some sort of transformation

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:13.016
of our original graph, f of x equals x squared 2. What I would like you to do

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:16.600
is match the letter next to each of these equations over here with the way that

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.702
it transforms this function. Then, if there's any missing information like the

00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:25.921
number of units the graph has shifted by, please fill that in as well. One

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:31.530
thing to note is this last choice down here, reflected in the x axis. What this

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.250
means is that if we have our standard x,y axis here, we have some curve drawn

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.770
like this, maybe a sort of parabola. If it's reflected in the x axis, that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.090
means it's been flipped across the X axis or flipped over the x axis, like

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.847
this. So, this graph below would be a reflection in the x axis of the one

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:56.730
above. Now it's up to figure out what equation makes that happen. Good luck.
