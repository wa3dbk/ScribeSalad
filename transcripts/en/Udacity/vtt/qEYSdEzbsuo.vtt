00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.340
The SNORT system has
four logical components.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.280
The packet decoder possesses each
capture packet to identify the protocol

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.120
headers at it's data link network
transport and application layers.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.250
The detection engine does the actual
work of intrusion detection.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.950
The detection engine checks each
packet against a set of rules.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.700
That is,
each packet is checked against all rules

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.549
to determine if the packet matches
the characters defined by a rule.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.800
A rule that matches the decoded
packet would trigger the action

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.890
specified by the rule.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.970
If no rule matches the packet,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.650
the detection engine
will discard the packet.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.460
For each packet that matches a rule,
the rule specifies what login or

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.040
alerting options are to be taken.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.120
When the login selection is selected,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.212
the logger stores the detected
packet in human readable format.

00:00:57.212 --> 00:01:02.040
This can then use the log files for
later analysis.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.970
For each detected packet,
an alert can be sent.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.120
An alert can be sent to a file,
a database, or an email, etc.
