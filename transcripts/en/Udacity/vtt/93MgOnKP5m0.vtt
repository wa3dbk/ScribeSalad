00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.480
The last point I want to touch on with the Dimple library.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.840
And usually this is possible with any library built on D3,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.450
is how we can interact with the dimple-created charts with native JavaScript,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.129
CSS or D3 code to add additional customizations.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.670
Here we can see the chart that we created as a combination of a dimple

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.210
scatter and a dimple line.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.960
But one improvement that I wanted to add is to

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.130
color the scatter circles red to draw more attention to them or

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.190
we can do this through dimple code D3 code or Java Script code.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.410
The simplest way to make this slight change is to use CSS.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.200
When customizing a chart created by another higher level library,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.020
we often need to find some class or ID to select the elements.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.200
In this case the circles.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.400
If we inspect element and look at the SVG created by dimple we can see here that

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.110
its a circle element with the ID equal to the date.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.230
And going over further,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.760
we can see that there's a bunch of different classes added to it.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.780
Since, we want to make all the circles red, the ID won't work.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.380
So we have to pick one of the classes, or

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.270
a few of them to change the styling on all the circles.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.110
In this case, it looks like all the circles are dimple series-1 class.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.970
Which is probably a good guess for

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.370
a class attached to all of the circles and none of the lines.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.250
Which we can then use in a CSS selector.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.650
In our HTML file we simply need to add a CSS style to the page as a whole.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.760
That selects circles with dimple series-1 class.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.470
Here we are selecting the circle elements with dimple series-1.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.830
And we're changing the fill property of the SVG circle to be red.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.930
Saving our file and reloading our page.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.230
And you can see here that the fill of the circles is now red,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.150
which makes them a little bit more distinguishable.
