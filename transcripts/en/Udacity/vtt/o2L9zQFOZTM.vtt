00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This approach works for the coin tossing problem,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but there are lots of other situations where we need to commit to values,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and we need to commit to values much longer than just 1 bit.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For that, we need something a little more versatile, but with the same idea.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What we need for this is what's called a cryptographic hash function.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's a function that has this property that it takes some large value as an input

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and outputs a small value.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is similar to a regular hash function like we used in a hash table,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
has the property that maps values from a large input domain.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And by large here, we usually mean infinite, such as all possible strings of any length

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to a small fixed output size.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It should also have the property that it's well distributed.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That for any given input, the probability that that input maps to a particular value

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is close to 1 over the size of the table, and we'll use N to represent the output size.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So we'll say that outputs are in the range from 0 of 10-1.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And so if it has this well-distributive property, this works great for a hash table.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is not enough for cryptographic committments.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If we just have these 2 properties, well, it might be easy to find other x values

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that map to the same thing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We saw that one of the things that we need for a cryptographic hash function

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is to make it hard for Alice to be able to do that, otherwise, she could find 2 inputs

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and cheat in the coin tossing game.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This first property of mapping a large input domain to a small fixed output,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we'll call compression.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What we need for a cryptographic hash function is 3 additional properties.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The properties are pre-image resistance, which means given the output of the hash function,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it's hard to find the input that produced it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This is a form of "one-way ness".

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The other 2 properties we need concern the collision resistance.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The weakest form of this is known as weak collision resistance.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What weak collision resistance means is that if we're given some hash value,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it's hard to find any input that hashes to the same result.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
These are sort of similar.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This one says it's hard to find the actual value of x that was used.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
This one says it's hard to find any x prime value that hashes to that value.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If we have weak collision resistance that would imply we have a form of pre-image resistance

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
as well.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The final property is strong collision resistance, which is exactly the one we saw

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that we needed for the coin tossing game.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Strong collision resistance requires that it's hard to find any pair, x and y,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
such that the hash of x is equal to the hash of y.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So have we seen anything that can do this?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And the question is, which of these is almost a good cryptographic hash function?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm using almost here in somewhat of a fuzzy way, but I want you to select the one

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that seems closest to being a good cryptographic hash function.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
None of them is a perfect cryptographic hash function,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and we'll discuss that more after the quiz.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So here are the choices.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Use cipher-block chaining mode to encrypt x, and then take the last output block

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
as the value of the hash.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The second choice is to use counter mode to encrypt x, and then take the last output block.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The third choice is to use electronic code block mode to encrypt x,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and then take all of the output blocks and XOR them all together and use the result

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
as the hash value.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The fourth choice is to use counter mode to encrypt x, XOR together all that,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
put blocks, and that's the hash value.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Which one of these makes the most sense to provide the cryptographic hash function

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
properties that we need?
