00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.709
The solutions for this equation are x equals 3 plus or minus root 7 all divide

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:10.243
by 2. Fantastic work if you found these solutions. I know they were tough. You

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:13.700
might have tried factoring here, but it turns out that we can't. For factoring,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.496
we would have had to find factors of positive 2 that summed to negative 6. But

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:22.464
we know the only factor pairs are positive 2 and positive 1, and negative 2 and

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:27.120
negative 1. Now that are those pairs summed to negative 6, so we can't use

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.009
factoring. We also can't use the root method here. We don't have a perfect

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.294
square on one side of the equation. Completing the square would also not work,

00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:39.394
since our a value is positive 2. You would want the a value to be positive 1

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:43.746
and the b value to be even in order to complete the square. So, using this

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:47.962
quadratic formula, we have a equal to 2, b equal to negative 6, and c equal to

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:53.272
positive 1. We plug the values of a, b, and c into their positions to get this

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:58.030
expression. The root of 36 minus 8 is the root of 28, and we know we can

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.290
simplify this root into 2 root 7. Next, we factor a 2 from the numerator,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.258
leaving us with this expression. We cancel the common factor of 2, that appears

00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:09.926
in the numerator and in the denominator, which leaves us with our most

00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:15.090
simplified form, our answers. We factor a 2 from these two terms to get this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.324
expression. Then, we cancel the common factor of 2 and then the numerator and

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:22.010
the denominator to get our final answers.
