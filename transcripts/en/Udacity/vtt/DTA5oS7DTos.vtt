00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.590
So let's go back again to our domain, with

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.580
all the sub-domains identified. And the basic idea, or the

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.750
intuitive idea I was talking about, is that errors tend

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.425
to occur at the boundary of a domain, or a

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:15.510
sub-domain. Like in this case. And why? Because these

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.360
are the cases that are less understood by the developers.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.155
Like for example, the last iteration of a loop, or

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.150
a special value like zero for integers. So if this

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.590
is true, what we want to do is to select inputs at these

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.189
boundaries. And this is complementary to partition

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.270
testing, in the sense that partition testing

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.160
will identify the partitions in which we want to select inputs, and boundary

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.570
testing. So the selection of boundary values

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.060
will help select inputs in these partitions.
