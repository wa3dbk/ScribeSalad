00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
In this course, we're going to do a considerable amount of algorithm analysis,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.960
which is why we're going to do an overview of the techniques and notations that we're going to use.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.240
If you've already had an algorithm course before and it terms like Big O-notation or RAM

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.360
or a worst-case running time are already meaningful to you, then you might try

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.800
and go directly for the quizzes for the respective sections.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
Let's try it out with a little quiz.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.180
What I want you think about is the various factors that we need to take into account

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.060
when we are analyzing an algorithm or more precisely, when we are analyzing the running time

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.520
of an algorithm because that would depend on the number of factors.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.950
What I would like you to think about is what factors

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.590
can determine the running time of an algorithm.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.640
So here are six different possibilities.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.830
First the size of the input, secondly the content or structure of the input,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.620
third the type of computer that we are using for the algorithm,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.280
fourth the amount of memory the computer has, five how the algorithm is implemented,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.260
and six the programming language that we're using to implement the algorithm.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.780
I want you think of each of those six aspects and then make a check mark

00:01:12.780 --> 99:59:59.000
where you think that this aspect can influence the running time of an algorithm.
