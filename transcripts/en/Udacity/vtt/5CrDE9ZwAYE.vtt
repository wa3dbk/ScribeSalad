00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.400
So you already touched on this aspect also. The fact that

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.560
more and more we are seeing end users using mobile platforms.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.240
&gt;&gt; And mobile platforms are entirely in the cloud.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.940
And so as this future revolution happens in the data

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.570
center things are changing. What do you expect as changes

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.900
that are happening at the consumer end of these services?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.410
&gt;&gt; To be honest, the consumer end is driving most of this.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.281
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:29.690
&gt;&gt; And the classical enterprise IT is following.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.411
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:34.270
&gt;&gt; So the, the consumer revolution in the mobile

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.550
And small devices of the like, are driving much of

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.460
this criteria. And the benefit then as accruing over time

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.190
to the usage of the systems. So, you want examples.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.690
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.480
&gt;&gt; With more and more collaboration needs, or sharing of state.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.660
You're going to put more state in the back end. To be

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.580
able to share them with multiple users. Or they need to

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.580
do things beyond just messaging, you know, sharing, sharing data sharing

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.870
state and the like. You'll find out that data will flow

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.510
quite a bit from the devices [INAUDIBLE]. And there are physics

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.090
however, the device cannot be very big, the battery or device

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.380
cannot be very big, so the device can only do so

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.670
much. So the back end has to do it for you.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.760
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.620
&gt;&gt; And finding the balance between them

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.130
will change over time as well, of course.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.750
&gt;&gt; But there's also brings an interesting, concern,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.050
that is, as you said, there's going to be

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.840
more that's happening in the back end, right?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.600
Because the mobile devices may not be able to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.730
do it all. And you also mentioned that,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.850
there may be collaboration among the mobile devices. And

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.640
a lot of the things that happen in

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.720
mobile devices today are streaming kinds of things, and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.040
how ready is the cloud for dealing with that kind of

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.153
traffic. And in particular you also mentioned that cloud is architect

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:57.680
ed today as throughput oriented not so much latency oriented. So

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.688
what do you see as changes that might be coming [UNKNOWN]? [CROSSTALK]

00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:03.440
&gt;&gt; The different type of streaming order. Okay, so for the,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.850
the bulk of inter traffic [UNKNOWN] steaming of pre recorded material.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.355
And the way that Internet can handle it at large as you know its

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:14.730
[INAUDIBLE]. So you have circle cs networks.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.140
Content solution networks. Where the content is

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.370
told that they edge closer to the user and once you ask for a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.180
movie and you'll be able to ask for it the second time is almost free

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.294
and by and large that's all working practically. I mean

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:30.720
um,uh, depending where you are in the world, Netflix for

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.950
example in the US is very big and so forth.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.940
To do more real time, it becomes more interesting, and more

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.640
conversant to be honest. And I think, I think things

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.277
will change as well. But I have to tell you,

00:02:42.277 --> 00:02:45.270
I am myself amazed how it works are already in

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.590
that sense. The latency aspects are, have to do with Ultimately

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.200
with physics. So there will be cases where if

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.480
your application requires a lot of chatty, lots of protocol

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.790
between a component and another component, you have to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.560
think seriously about where they should land. If it's very

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.100
chatty and physics, as the same, we cannot change

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.650
the laws of physics, They have to be closer to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.832
each other. So decomposing the app, whether it be, be

00:03:11.832 --> 00:03:15.590
to [INAUDIBLE] time live streaming of data or video, whatever,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.530
is very important to put chatty stuff and where they

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.510
should land, which is where they can withstand the long distance.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.500
&gt;&gt; Right, but that also brings up the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.170
question of data centers as they are architecture today.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.750
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.840
&gt;&gt; They are, as you mentioned, they're in some darkroom somewhere. But if my

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.100
mobile device is latency sensitive, shouldn't it

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.350
be closer to where the mobile device is?

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.330
&gt;&gt; True. And there will be multiple levels.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.630
So you want put some competitional on device. That's, if

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.790
it, if the latency between two components is so critical,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.610
there's no way you can cross any wire So some

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.170
will live in the device itself. Some will live on the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.370
edge of the network before we get to the actual

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.920
DC. And in, increasingly, there are mega services on the internet.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.800
Don't directly hit, you don't hit the DC directly. You

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.980
go to a net somewhere. And you do also when optimizations.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.840
TCPIP optimizations. For example, You may land to an edge

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.760
closer to you. And there the connection between that base and

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.310
the actual DC yard, I get to create over common [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.200
connections. So tricks are definitely

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.560
important. Latency hiding tricks are important.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.730
&gt;&gt; So this next question I'm going to ask

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.370
you is more related to. From the students' perspectives.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.480
You know, the students that are taking

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.510
this course, this is an advanced operating

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.480
systems course, and and these students, they

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.720
may be aspiring to work in leading software

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.460
companies such as yours. What would be

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.330
your advice to students that are taking this

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.670
course? Specifically can you talk to the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.228
students about, the opportunities that exists, for O.S.

00:04:57.228 --> 00:05:01.300
designers today in the industry space. And how

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.810
the students should prepare themselves for such opportunities.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.130
&gt;&gt; Sure, I'll be honest with you, you may not design new O.S. from scratch

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.310
We have a bunch of them already. But every concept you're learning here will be

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.180
needed, more than beneficial, needed, when you

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.540
move up and down the stack. If you're

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.670
doing an application, like much of the discussion we had right now, a high scale

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.530
application, it's, it's no longer writing an application through on

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.640
a machine by itself, displaying to a screen. All the

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.430
issues we touch on, you have to worry about, you

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.542
have to know about them. You have to know about

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:36.260
caching and scale, you have to know about synchronization, data

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.890
replication, handling failures, so all these concepts you have in

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.740
a classic of OS sense, are directly applicable regardless where

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.080
you live up and down the [UNKNOWN] So I'm convinced

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.740
that with out a fund, a strong foundation operating

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.510
systems and a few other topics, programming languages and

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.180
the like. One cannot handle or build those big

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.290
applications. You could do some simple work programming, do some

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.080
java script and a nice animated screen, don't get

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.010
me wrong, this all is important. But if you

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.390
want to do the real scalable services where the

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.710
entity's moving you have to have the foundations. More generically,

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.630
you have to also use the information you learned here and be ready, ready

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.800
to learn more. And to apply it

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.170
in different domains. So the classical papers that

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.250
you taught me way back when are still relevant. But as we discussed, you

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.180
may have to apply them differently to

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.220
morph them, evolve them, into newer [INAUDIBLE] areas.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.990
&gt;&gt; So I want to make sure that the students get an idea

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.320
about specific things that you think that they should get when they're

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.890
in school. What are the things if you can name, specify, I

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.460
mean, specifically can you name a few things that you think are

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.830
important for students to get while they are still a student here.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.570
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. College time. The time you are taking right now to learn

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.740
all this stuff is a most exciting time to be honest. Because you

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.560
can keep an open mind. And go white. So learn as why I think that's possible.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.180
You want specific things in computer science, let's

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.260
be specific here. Definitely operating systems. Distribute systems

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.160
and definitely programming language as a background. I

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.540
think they're very important. The foundations for any

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.444
platform level type of work if you [UNKNOWN]...

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.790
Know the classical information, but also know how

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.950
to apply them and what you actually have in

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.590
every day and the like. What else would I want

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.870
to do? Frankly beyond CS, I would also try

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.990
to get other back ground that complement what I do.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.140
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.720
&gt;&gt; Even the things like humanities and the like, that are

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.470
actually important because when you move up and you want to work

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.400
in industry and the like. Much what we do, we actually write

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.890
code. We design code. We make software. But we also, no longer

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.240
build things by ourselves. Now the systems you have

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.480
at your disposal aren't built by one person, they

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.130
are built by teams. So learn how to work

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.470
in teams. Learn how to deal with other people like

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.100
you who have to collaborate. And, build a software

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.030
collage. Some districts can only, we often, look, you may

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.040
only learn the basics in college. But, as you

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.230
go forward, you know, apply the large software. And also,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.300
don't shy away from the tough assignments, you know. Push

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.170
the envelope while you can right now. Then, come back and

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.440
you can really apply them as you go forth. Lastly a

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.159
good foundation in just knowing the basics of computer science, basic

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.808
you know, algorithm, algorithm design analysis is actually very

00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:45.210
important. So the more advanced topics, you never did

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.900
ask you in industry what np is equal to p, and go solve this one or solve that.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.510
But you will have to reason almost every day

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.780
about the basic complexity of an algorithm, or to

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.860
basically to apply a certain technique on the like.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.840
And the foundation algorithms are really important as well.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.570
&gt;&gt; So outside of school, though they are in

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.890
school, there's a chance for them to, to hone their

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.690
skills overall. What do you think of things

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.710
that they should be absorbing outside of school?

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.020
&gt;&gt; I would start the habit now, outside

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.230
of school, to keep track what's happening out there.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.110
If you join [UNKNOWN] tomorrow, you will, in a

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.620
sense, have stopped learning what the [UNKNOWN] stuff is and

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.330
you start going and learning what's happening out there. And

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.450
things move very quickly out there as you know. So

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.630
start right now understanding what's happening in general. So

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.350
know the fundamentals but also know how people are applying

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.780
them. Be curious. I mean I sometimes bring up a

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.500
browser look at a pic and say how they done

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.730
this thing and oh it's Ajax doing dress for APIs and

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.720
so forth. So learn to be curious from right now and learn

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.300
to link what you do with what you see around you

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.790
as well. And that habit has to start early and don't stop

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.780
it. Keep it going. The worst thing that can happen is

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.560
for you to go to industry and to spend five years doing

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.380
the same thing and nothing but that. You have to be

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.900
able to be curious and see around you as well. And that

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.050
habit has to be started right now.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:13.240
&gt;&gt; So the next question is very specific to you and your own journey.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:20.290
&gt;From a student in the 80's to becoming a leader in your chosen field,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.940
what are some of the skill sets you wish you had acquired when you're

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.960
still a student. If you reflect back, what are the things that you would have

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.900
done differently or learned differently as a student that might have helped you?

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.340
&gt;&gt; Honestly, I mean, I'll be quite honest

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.480
with you. I took the least amount of humanities

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.248
I could get, and I loaded my schedule with

00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:47.180
CS and E,classes and math because that was the

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.990
fun stuff, the heavy stuff. And not go any

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.440
wrong this always important too, but take a balance

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.430
view to this. The humanity is all important knowing

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.510
what's really around you beyond just the actual chord

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.390
and the bits are very important. And the reason

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.530
is very simple really, which is a part of my

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.450
last answer. When you go out there and do

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.250
things, you'll be expected to lead. To work with others

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.360
and to tell them where to go, if you

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.410
will. So you can lead them or you can follow.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.440
It's better to lead, to be honest. And to

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.300
lead, you need to have soft skills and an ability

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.790
to understand people. So learning about the humanities, learning about

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.000
critical thinking and writing. Had actually very important, and sometimes

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.440
we in Academia don't pay enough attention to these things, to be honest. We'll

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.720
be great to make sure you hone your skills in that space as well.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.543
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:42.250
&gt;&gt; I mean a critical for example, in the US, a critical English writing class

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.420
may sound, you know, too much work, and why do I need this. But it can

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.310
really hone your skills for critical thinking,

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.890
critical analysis. Of the language. So, fast forward

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.630
20 years, or in my case more than that, and you have to send an email

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.540
explaining why something is going right, is

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.350
going wrong, et cetera. Conveying the message in

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.260
two paragraphs or to some busy people, that's

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.220
actually a skill that has little to do

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.910
with writing code, to be honest. But more of, can I put my thoughts down to

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.250
paper quickly and clearly and concisely? With softer

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.480
scales or in ethical scales are important too.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.160
&gt;&gt; So, this is more of an advice from me of

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.640
professors like me from your experience. In your opinion, what you, what. How

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.230
do you think we can better prepare our students? To be ready for the work place.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.980
&gt;&gt; There's a couple of dimensions. One is, just

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.370
to bring the last thought, and then we'll switch a

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.610
different point. One dimension is that in Academia, you, you,

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.690
you're going through a class, you're going to give a grade

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.420
to every student and the grade is his or

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.970
her grade. So in academia we basically look at

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.470
the individual performance, did I pass or not? Don't

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.700
get me wrong, the same happens in industry, but to

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.760
get through anything in industry, you have to collaborate.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.990
So what's usually missing in, in, in, in the

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.630
more academic environment is how to build software, for

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.030
example, in a, and how to do the soft skills

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.260
for building software in a group. And those things

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.880
are hard to get, I know, in academia, but it

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.150
is something I wish we can get more at

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:23.370
the graduate, with that background, if you want. You typically

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.550
have something in you when you, when you're, you're

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.650
a good leader, but then when you go join a

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.670
company and the like, you have to go nurture

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.870
and do more of that. Otherwise, that really would happen.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.550
Beyond that, there are some things which would be great

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.310
if you make sure that the students can push the envelope

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.490
in ways that otherwise we in industry cannot do. So make

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:50.500
sure they have in them the, ability to try things which

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.720
otherwise some of us will try it and say it doesn't

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.770
work. You know, I'm not jaded by that. So it's important

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.740
to instill in the students that, that, and I think you

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.680
do a good job of that, but it's important to remember

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.330
that, that, that to push the envelope. Because once you

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.000
hit industry and the like, you're going to find constraints. You

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.980
have to shift quickly. There's a deadline et cetera, and

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.410
you may forget about what's possible. Never forget what's really possible.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.650
&gt;&gt; So, do you have any final thoughts that you want to share?

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.590
&gt;&gt; Again, thank you for the opportunity. This is great. I hope you enjoy his

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.840
class. I'm going to actually plan to take

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.770
it. I'm not going to take it for grades

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.090
ok but I'm going to go I want to see it. I'm looking forward to it.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.650
I think, sir, it's a great thing you're doing. And I wish you real luck.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.350
&gt;&gt; Well thank you so much, Yousef, for coming and joining us.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you, sure.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.390
&gt;&gt; And let's thank Youself for being

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.970
here and sharing his thoughts with you all.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
