00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.100
Let's start by undoing our latest change
and delete the photo frame entity.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.508
So the model is as it was before.

00:00:06.508 --> 00:00:10.052
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:13.150
Now we must create a new
version of our model.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.510
Add model version.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.550
You can call it however you want.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.170
Model two seems reasonable and
it's based on our current model.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.670
Now you can see that we have
two different model versions.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.900
However, the previous one is
still marked as the current one.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.670
We need to change that.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.850
To change the current version of
your model, select your model.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.750
And then, in the file inspector,
look for model version.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.780
And current should be Model 2.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.020
So now we have our new version
marked as the current one.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.772
We should make all the changes
back to this new version.

00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:07.625
So let's go ahead and
add the photo frame entity back.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:12.841
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:16.736
The last step, is to make a minor
change in our core data stack,

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:22.040
to make sure that it does the migration
from version one to version two.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.790
We do this by adding two simple
options to the persistent coordinator.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.010
Let's get it done.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.490
We create a dictionary of options and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.944
one is
NSMigratePersistentStoreAutomaticallyOp-

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:38.000
tion which is pretty
obvious what it's doing.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.150
And we're setting it to true.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.840
We want to migrate.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.260
And we're also telling the persistent
store to infer the mapping model.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.060
So we're telling you,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.930
find out how you should migrate from
version one to version two, and

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.100
we simply pass these options when we
add a store coordinator and that's it.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.310
Now it's your turn.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.050
Grab your x code and
create a new version of your model.
