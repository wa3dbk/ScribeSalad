00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.834
Based on what you've seen so far, let's see if you can shift a circle. So here

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:09.480
this orange circle was our original circle we saw with a radius of 50 units.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.264
This blue circle was our same circle shifted 20 units to the right. And keep in

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:19.680
mind even though we went 20 units to the right, we see a subtraction of 20 in

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.443
the equation I feel like this goes against my intuition. Usually when I think

00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:29.278
about moving to the right, in the x direction, I think about adding or positive

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:34.626
20. But in our equation it's actually a negative 20. You always want to keep

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:38.630
this in mind when shifting a circle. What's in the equation will be the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.730
opposite of the direction we move. So if we have negative 20 in an equation, we

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.016
really move our circle 209 units to the right. So, knowing this, what do you

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:53.156
think would be the equation of a circle with center at negative 10, 2 and a

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:58.091
radius of 50? Enter that equation here.
