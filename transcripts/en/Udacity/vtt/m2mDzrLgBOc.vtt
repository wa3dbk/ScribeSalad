00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.780
Currently, the user has no way of
knowing they've entered a location that

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.650
our server can not handle.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.890
In fact, our source code is also
blissfully unaware of this case.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.210
We'll fix that.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.295
We'll have to add a new location status.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:16.855
Location status invalid.

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:20.135
But how do we know that that
location is unknown to the server?

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:21.975
It turns out that with each transaction,

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:27.205
the Open Weather Map API returns
a code in JSON similar to HTTP codes.

00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:28.515
For success it returns 200,

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:34.165
if the location isn't found it returns
a 404 error, location not found.

00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:38.100
So if we see a 404 error we know that
the user has entered something that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.200
the server doesn't understand.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.020
Great, we can modify the code and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.870
get weather data from JSON
to understand this code.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.690
Then we can set the location
status to the invalid state,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.160
when this response is detected.
