00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.530
My name is Lewis Kaneshiro.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.460
I build courses here at Udacity and

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.890
I've used version control in different forms for about four years now.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.570
Version control makes me more of a risk taker in the sense that

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.510
I'm able to explore pretty significant changes in the code base.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.590
Architecture differences at,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.640
at a very low level without fear of breaking the entire project.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.900
and, and, and freaking out, you know, for

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.580
lack of a better word, to try to make it work again.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.570
And so, without version control the way I looked at code was as soon as it

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.520
was working, I would make very small iterative changes.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.160
Whereas with version control I, I'm able to rethink the entire code base or, or

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.700
rethink parts of them that quite honestly I wouldn't have approached or

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.780
even touched for fear of breaking it.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.460
So, in general big picture the things I really like about version control is

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.400
really this idea of exploration.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.220
Without version control I feel that developing as a programmer is,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.090
is taking little baby steps of making a program incrementally better.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.056
Whereas with version control you can explore such a large space of, of,

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:10.440
of things to try, and you can do that easily without really

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.730
worrying about having to go back and fix a project that's that's broken.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.550
So I feel version control has made me a better programmer because it

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.540
allows me to explore deep concepts, deep architectural concepts within

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.320
programs that I wouldn't be able to explore easily and

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.248
more efficiently if I was not using version control.
