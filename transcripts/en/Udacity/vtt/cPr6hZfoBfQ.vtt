00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.410
So, we're going to talk
about a couple of the U.S.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.710
laws related to cyber crime and
illegal online activities.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.730
The first one is the U.S.
Computer Fraud and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
Abuse Act, that's CFAA,
actually goes back a while.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.250
But the goal of this law or
this act, was to define

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.350
what is criminal, when it comes
to things that you do online.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.890
So, various types of online abuse.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.990
And then define criminal sanctions
against those kind of actions or

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.760
activities.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.200
That constitute abuse or fraud.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.380
So, it really covers unauthorized
access to computers.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.940
So, you're not allowed to be some
place in the physical world,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700
we have laws like that.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.080
Here we're sort of trespassing
somebody's computer that

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.590
is connected to the internet and
we can reach out to it.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.490
So computer obviously has things
of value that you are after.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.670
If you happen to the the cyber criminal,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.570
that's who is being
targeted by this law.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.980
So I said it goes back a while,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.410
initially it was rather net-over
it was trying to protect.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.785
It's sort of multuation came from
national security, national defense.

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:17.620
So, it's saying if you gain
unauthorized access to a computer

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.630
that has data related
to national defense.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.870
That is illegal.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.710
This was then extended
to financial data,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.030
because people do care
about their money.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.510
And criminals,
cyber criminals actually after money.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.820
They want to steal
your online account or

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.050
steal credit card information and so on.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.690
If you access either defense related or

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.170
financial data and
the access is unauthorized.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.110
CFAA says that that's an illegal act.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.930
So, what exactly is unauthorized access?

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.315
Unauthorized access essentially,
is getting hold of this data,

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:53.940
gaining access to it.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.790
So remember, when it comes to
data we had the confidentiality,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.720
integrity and availability requirements.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.880
That we had the CIA requirements,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.570
that we had to find when you
talk about securing data.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.770
So, gaining access to it,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.820
you're able to see the data that
you shouldn't be able to see.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.040
Use it, for example,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.720
of financial gain modification is
affecting its integrity, corrupting it.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.900
Destroying is exactly that,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.630
disclosure is to anybody who's not
authorized to see it and so on.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.430
If all this is done when the system
under consideration happens to be

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.660
a government system.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.290
Well that's how CFAA started, so

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.958
this basically is saying the law
covers access to information.

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.210
Modification, we're not allowed to do so
and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.640
using that information in any shape and
form.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.270
Destroying it, affecting availability,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.620
that's what you would do with this,
is illegal.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.160
So, this one initially was
something that is operated by or

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.640
on behalf, so it could be
a contractor or the US government.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.470
But this, as a history this was
broadened to include any computer.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.470
The language is any protected computer,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.310
basically a protected computer is any
computer that's connected the Internet.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.200
So, a protected computer,
if you access it without permission, and

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.660
gain access to the data, or destroy it.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.650
Or corrupt it while you're
committing an illegal act.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.050
It then actually keeps getting more and
more specific.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.120
Transmitting code or malware, malicious
software that can damage a computer,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.250
well that's illegal as well.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.009
And finally,

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.480
it specifically addresses passwords that
I'd use to gain access to computers.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.340
So, if you steal a truckload
of passwords and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.420
want to sell them on the black market,
the underground market.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.750
That's trafficking in
computer passwords and

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.240
if you did that,
that would be illegal as well.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.960
So, accessing data that is
not yours in various forms.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.390
Infecting computers with malicious
software, trafficking in passwords that

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.360
allow others to gain access to
computers that are protected.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.040
All those things are covered
under the Computer Fraud and

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.650
Abuse Act that we have
in the United States.
