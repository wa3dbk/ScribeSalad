00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:04.255
So now we know how to compact in parallel, but only if we figure out how to

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:07.459
compute the scatter addresses efficiently and in parallel.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.388
So let's take a closer look at the computation that we need to do here.

00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:16.598
We're going to have a set predicates here-- true, false, false, true, true, false, true, false.

00:00:16.598 --> 00:00:21.781
And what we need to do is compute the scatter addresses that will result from this string of predicates.

00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:27.368
Since we don't care about the scatter addresses for the false values, we'll just put a dash for don't care.

00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:31.501
Our algorithm is going to generate something there, it just doesn't matter what it generates.

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:38.596
Again, our goal is to input this predicate string and output this string of addresses.

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:41.488
And now we'll do a simple substitution.

00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:44.798
Whenever we see a true here, we'll substitute the number 1.

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:48.571
Whenever we see a false here, we'll substitute the number 0.

00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.504
And rather than "don't cares" I'm actually going to fill in some values here.

00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:59.812
So we're going to have the strings 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4. So here's our input, a bunch of trues and falses.

00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:04.915
We're translating it into 1s and 0s, and this is our output, our set of addresses here.

00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:07.769
And now perhaps the shortest quiz of the course.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:10.933
If this is the input, and this is the output,

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:15.027
what is the operation we need to do to get from this input to this output?

00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:18.904
Hint. Your answer is 1 word, of 4 letters.
