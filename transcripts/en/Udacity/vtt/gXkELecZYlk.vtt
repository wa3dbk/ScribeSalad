00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:01.829
Welcome to unit 4!

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.011
Unit 4 will be a little different from previous units.

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:08.209
We are gonna start in right away by finishing the code for the search engine.

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.145
What we have built so far is a web crawler.

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:13.696
It can follow content on web pages, following links to find other pages,

00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:16.027
but it doesn't actually respond to queries.

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:18.278
What we are going to build in this unit is a search engine,

00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:22.411
where we can pass in a keyword and get a list of the pages that contain that keyword.

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:26.712
We are also going to learn how the Internet works and the World Wide Web.

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:32.478
The main new computer science idea in this unit is the idea of how to use and build complex data structures.

00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:36.178
In order to respond to queries quickly, we want to be able to have a data structure

00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:39.640
where we can look up a keyword and quickly find the pages that match that keyword,

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:43.569
without needing to scan all pages every time.

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:47.176
To do this we are going to build a structure called an inverted index, or often just - an index,

00:00:47.176 --> 00:00:52.396
that allows us to have a mapping between keywords and pages that contain these keywords.

00:00:52.396 --> 00:00:55.694
Our index is really the same idea as an index in a book.

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:58.378
I happen to have a book handy.

00:00:58.378 --> 00:01:01.911
That is one of my favorites. I might be a little biased, since I wrote it.

00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:07.445
But let's take a look and see if there is anything in the book that would help us understand index searching.

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:12.029
We could try to read the whole book, see if there is anything about index search in here,

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:18.177
or we could go to the index, and if we are lucky, the index will have what we have, it's got "index search".

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:23.061
As each keyword in the index it has the page number, so we would go to the page number where that is found,

00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:26.662
and instead of needing to read the whole book to try to find what we are looking for,

00:01:26.662 --> 00:01:32.912
if we can find the right page, we will find the section on index search right away.

00:01:32.912 --> 00:01:35.345
So that's the goal of an index.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.895
For our search engine what we want is an index that provides a mapping

00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:41.895
from keywords to list of webpages where that keyword appears.
