Going through the steps that we know and love now for finding inverse

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:08.320
functions, here's what we end up with. Starting with f of x equals x over 4, f

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.114
inverse of x equals 4x. This makes perfect sense. F is dividing x by 4, and f

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:21.668
inverse is multiplying it by 4. Checking our work, f of f inverse of x equals

00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:27.829
4x over 4, which is just x. Going the other direction, f inverse of f of x

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:33.918
gives us 4 times x over 4, which is just x. Awesome! This must really be our

00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:40.079
inverse. Looking at g of x, we started off with g of x equals 4 over x. And

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.560
interestingly enough, g inverse of x also equals 4 over x. Let's double-check

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.897
to make sure this works. G of g inverse of x is 4 over 4 over x, which

00:00:49.897 --> 00:00:56.200
simplifies to x. Hm, we get exactly the same thing for g inverse of g of x,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.670
since g inverse and g are the same thing. So we also end up with x for this. G

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.820
here is a special kind of function. It's the inverse of itself.
