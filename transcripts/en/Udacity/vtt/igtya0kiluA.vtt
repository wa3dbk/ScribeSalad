00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.668
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know we can perform a substitution with the y. I have y isolated on one

00:00:04.668 --> 00:00:09.741
side of the equation. So I can take 2x minus 2 and substitute it in for y. Next

00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:15.017
we distribute the negative 2. So I get negative 4x and negative 2 times negative

00:00:15.017 --> 00:00:19.619
2 which is positive 4. The like terms sum to zero, so I'm just left with

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.415
positive 4. If you got those steps right, excellent work.
