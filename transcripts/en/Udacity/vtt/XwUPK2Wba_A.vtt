00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.428
Maybe there is hope for these functions, though. Perhaps some domain

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:07.680
restrictions could help us out. After all, if we only look at part of these

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.810
graphs, it might be that the part we leave passes the horizontal line test.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.696
That will mean that, that part at least, would have an inverse. Let's just

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:19.705
focus in on one of these two for the moment. If we look at this function, only

00:00:19.705 --> 00:00:22.895
in the part of the domain where x is greater than or equal to 0, does that

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:28.006
function have an inverse? And then secondly, if we look at the function only

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:32.927
where x is less than or equal to 0, does that function have an inverse? Think

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:36.455
about which parts of this graph each of these are looking at, and then decide

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:40.550
whether or not they each pass the horizontal line test.
