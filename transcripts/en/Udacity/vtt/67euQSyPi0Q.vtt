00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.007
So we saw that the operating system is
really the trusted computing base, and

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.734
it has to be isolated
from untrusted code.

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:12.380
We saw the hardware features and
how they could be used to achieve this.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.250
We saw how hardware support sets
its process execution modes.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.494
And memory protection are used to
meet the complete mediation and

00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:21.883
tamper resistance or

00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:26.605
tamper-proof property that we require
from a trusted computing base.
