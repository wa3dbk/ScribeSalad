00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.683
So I want to start by showing you two paragraphs. Here's the first one. They're

00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:07.362
all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot. He noticed once

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:11.538
even before he was introduced. When I was in the DBC with Poldy laughing and

00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:15.868
trying to listen, I was waggling, my foot. We both order two teas and plain

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:19.580
bread, and butter and I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters, when

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.060
I stood up and asked the girl, where it was, what do I care with it dropping

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.714
out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy, takes you half an hour

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:30.368
to let down, wetting all myself, always, with some brand new fad every other

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:38.302
week. Here's the second one. This creation in which we live, began with the

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:43.352
Dominant Nature as an Identification Body. With a completed evolutionary Strong

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:48.406
Material creation in a Major Body Resistance Force. And is fulfilling the

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:52.111
Nature Identification in a Like Weaker Material Identification creation in

00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:55.531
which two major bodies have already fulfilled radio body balances, and

00:00:55.531 --> 00:01:02.652
embodying. A third material identification embodiment of both. So, what do you

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:06.584
think about these two paragraphs? Is either one creative, or both, or are

00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:10.330
neither? Check whichever one you feel is creative.
