Hey, everyone.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.750
My name's Jared.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.940
&gt;&gt; My name's Gabriele.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.750
&gt;&gt; And my name is Jessica.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.650
In the coming weeks and months you are
going to be learning the foundational

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.640
skills used every day by iOS developers.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.980
You'll also be learning the Swift
programming language, which is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.150
Apple's custom language designed for
iOS, Mac OS, and Watch OS development.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.420
&gt;&gt; Before going any further,
you'll need to download and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.570
install the core tool for
any iOS developer, Xcode.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.210
Xcode is Apple's integrated
development environment,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.520
which in layman's terms is the place
where you build your apps.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.240
Downloading Xcode is simple.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.860
It's available for
free on the App Store app on your Mac.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.920
&gt;&gt; If you need additional help
you can find instructions below.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.968
Depending on your Internet speed
however, this download can take a while.

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:44.209
But don't worry, go ahead and
grab something to drink.

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:45.960
We'll have some things to keep
you busy in the meantime.
