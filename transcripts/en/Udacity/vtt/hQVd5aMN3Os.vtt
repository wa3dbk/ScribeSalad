00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.212
Last time we saw Grant, he had just gotten the opportunity to expand the area of

00:00:05.212 --> 00:00:10.326
his booth at the expo. Now it's 15 feet long and 20 feet wide. As excited as he

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:15.550
is about this, we know Grant. He always wants more. He wants to make this booth

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.842
even bigger. The person in charge of the expo is going to continue the

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:24.514
regulation he had before which is that if Grant's going to increase his booth

00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:28.977
size, he has to do it by the same length in each direction. Let's call that

00:00:28.977 --> 00:00:33.397
length x, just like we did earlier. However, there's one catch. The expo

00:00:33.397 --> 00:00:38.089
authorities are adding another restriction to booth size. The area of a given

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.966
booth is not allowed to exceed 750 square feet. Considering this new rule that's

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:47.308
been put in place about area, how should we express the booth area? Are we going

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:51.728
to need an equation? Are we going to need an inequality? Or do we need something

00:00:51.728 --> 00:00:52.092
else?
