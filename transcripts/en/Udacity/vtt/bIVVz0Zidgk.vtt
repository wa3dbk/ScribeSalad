00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Just as we can get a lot of use out of + for 1 or more copies,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
sometimes it's nice to have 0 or more copies.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So we'll introduce the star regular expression for that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You can convert between the 2 of them.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you wanted 1 or more copies of a, you could have a, followed by 0 or more copies of a.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Some classes or texts will teach the star first and then move on to the plus.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We teach the plus first because it's more common for specifying Python and Javascript.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So now, the plus, the star, the question mark, the open square brackets,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the closed square brackets--they all mean something special in regular expressions.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
They help us to note sets of strings.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What if the string I want to match is actually just a + sign.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
How do it do it if + means 1 or more copies of what came before?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We need some way of saying, "No, no--I really mean it!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Actually +, not 1 or more, just +."

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We're going to solve this by using something called escape sequences,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but before I get into them, let's introduce them by way of analogy.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In Python, you can declare a string using double quotes or single quotes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So if you want to have a constant string that reads, P &amp; P is Jane's book.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If you use single quotes, Python will get confused because you have 1 here,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
1 here, and 1 there, and it will think your string ends at the "e" in Jane.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
No problem, you say?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I will just use double quotes.That's what they're there for.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But what if you want to include quoted dialogue in your string?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So now I want to say, "I said, P &amp; P is Jane's book."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So now I'm using both the single quote and the double quote for their actual meanings.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What do I put on the side?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, Python will actually let you bypass this by using triple quotes,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but what if I really wanted to have triple quotes in the middle too?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We can't do this forever.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Well, it turns out that if I just put a backward slash, a backslash, in front of a quote

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or a double quote or whatnot,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Python will treat it as being part of this string and not as being the end of the string.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We're escaping out of treating quotes as string delimiters,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
so this is Python's way of saying, no, no, I really mean it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I actually have a quote there.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now when you actually go to write this down in Python,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you may not get different colors or different fonts,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so this maybe a little hard to read,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but it does work.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I can use these escape sequences to literally write down a special character.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The backslash is sometimes called an escape character and the 2 of these together

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
are an escape sequence, a sequence of characters that are treated as if it were

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
just the double quotes, just a single quote.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Note that Python is throwing away this backslash.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You won't actually see it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Just to show you how this sort of thing plays out in Python,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I've written down 2 different versions of P &amp; P is Jane's book--

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
one using double quotes and one using an escape sequence.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We're going to print out both of their values and then check to see if they're actually equal.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And in fact, they are.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Even though we entered them slightly differently,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Python treats them both the same internally and indicates that they're equal.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Here's 1 more example of this.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This time with a double quote being escaped twice.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And again, the 2 strings are equal under the hood as Python deals with them.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It turns out that we can do the same thing in regular expressions.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Suppose you want to find the string '++'.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
This regular expression "\+\+" has 2 escape sequences,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.123
and it finds only the string '++'.
