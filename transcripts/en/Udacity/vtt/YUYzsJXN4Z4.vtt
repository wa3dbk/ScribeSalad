00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.930
Rebecca just moved to a new house so

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.210
let's update her address
in the database.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.240
Here, we find Rebecca in
the employee database,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.610
assuming she's the only
Rebecca Allen in our employee table.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.600
Next, we find her address
by matching rebecca.id to

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.309
the employee id in the address database.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.880
Then, we set the street property of
her address to 281 Summer Circle.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.890
We also update her zipcode to 00189.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.180
Now, what do we add to our
session before we commit so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.490
that this update takes place?
