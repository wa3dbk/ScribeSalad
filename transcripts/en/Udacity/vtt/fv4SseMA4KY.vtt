00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.567
Now, let's make this a little bit more challenging. Sometimes, there might be

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:07.780
two radicals in your equation. If there are two radicals, it's best to separate

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.888
them, so one is on each side of this equals sign. We've seen adding numbers and

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:16.972
fractions to both sides of an equation. Well, we can do the same with a

00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:21.580
radical. We'll just add it on the left, and add it on the right. On the left,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.760
we'll just have 2 root x. And on the right hand side, we'll have the square

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.589
root of 3x plus 9. Now I definitely think you're at a position to solve this

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.890
equation. Think about what you could do to both sides of the equation to

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.387
eliminate the radical symbol. Then when you think you've solved for x, type

00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:43.674
your answer here. Again, if there's no solution, I want you to type ns. Good

00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:44.420
luck on this one.
