00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.260
Finally, I'd like to finish this lesson with talking about philosophy a little

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:11.740
bit. And these insights come from the Danish Design researcher Piete En,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.460
and he is relating the process of software design to the thinking of

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.620
four important philosophers. So, first philosophers, Descartes.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.280
We think about Descartes with analytic geometry. And this may translate for

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.400
us into thinking about the analysis phase of software design.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.340
On the other hand, Marx is very concerned with social processes and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.300
classes. And understanding the social context of design,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.020
maybe even involving the users in the design process. Martin Heidegger,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.110
was concerned, among other things, with tools. And of course,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.320
tools play a big role in the automation of our development process and

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.810
tools like IDEs in our active development environments and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.379
case tools, computer aided software engineering tools of course play a big role.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.123
And finally, my favorite is Wittgenstein, the Austrian philosopher,

00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:15.430
who came up with the concept of language games. And, what this means, is

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.200
the inventing of a vocabulary, that helps you think about a particular problem.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.240
For example, think about the introduction of personal computers and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.840
the role that thinking, the role of the terminology of the desktop,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.870
folders, trash baskets, and so on, play in doing that.
