Now that we've talked about UX research and why

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.890
it's important, let's get back to what we were

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.610
talking about, which is how do you, we,how do

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.180
we use personas and use cases to drive feature lists?

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.780
&gt;&gt; Exactly so we're going to hear from an actual user and she's

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.360
going to tell us a little bit about her attributes and she's going to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.090
tell you about her favorite application. So when you listen to her

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.770
talk see if you can guess what her favorite feature will be.
