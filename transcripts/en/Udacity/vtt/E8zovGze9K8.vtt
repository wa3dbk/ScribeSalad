00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.485
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If we're looking for profit equals 0, that means we're looking for the point

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.812
on our line where y is equal to 0. That's just along the x axis. This is the x

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:13.559
intercept of our graph and the coordinates of this point are 4,0. So that means

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.936
that Grant will break even after just 4 days of using this ad agency. This

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:21.607
investment is going to pay for itself in only four days. That seems like a

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:23.560
pretty smart business decision to me.
