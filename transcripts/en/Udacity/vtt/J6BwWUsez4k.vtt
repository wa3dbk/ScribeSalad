00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.730
During this lesson, we focused on the map reduced

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.770
programming model. A very common open source implementation of

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.280
the map reduce programming model is HADOOP. HADOOP couples

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.000
the map reduce programming model with a distributed file system.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.630
In order to more easily allow programmers to complete

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.070
complicated tasks using the processing power of HADOOP, there

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.720
are many infrastructures out there that either built on

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.550
top of HADOOP, Or allow data access via Hadoop. Two

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.550
of the most common are Hive and Pig. Hive was

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.280
initially developed by FaceBook, and one of its biggest selling

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.770
points is that it allows you to run map-produced jobs

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.410
through a SQL-like querying language, called the Hive Query Language.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.130
Pig was originally developed at Yahoo! And excels in some

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.160
areas Hive does not. Pig jobs are written in a

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.410
procedural language called pig Latin. This wins you a bunch

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.620
of things. Among them are the ability to be more explicit

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.420
about the execution of your data processing. Which

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.940
is not possible in a declarative language like SQL

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.750
syntax. And also the ability to split your data

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.900
pipeline. Hive and Pig are two of the most

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.960
common Hadoop-based products, but there are a bunch

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.070
of them out there. For example Mahout for machine

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.710
learning, Giraph for graph analysis, and Cassandra, a hybrid

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.040
of a key value and a column oriented database.
