Well, we know we invested a total amount of $10,000. So x plus y must be 10,000.

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:09.185
If I solve for y here, I know that number must be 7,500. Great thinking if you

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:13.434
got that right. We know when we plug in the values for x and y, we get a true

00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:17.948
statement in this first equation. And it turns out if we plug in x and y in our

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:22.588
second equation, we'll also get a true statement. [inaudible] Try working out

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:26.570
this math to make sure that we have the right answer. The equations are checked,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.156
which means that we have the correct x and y. It works in both equations.
