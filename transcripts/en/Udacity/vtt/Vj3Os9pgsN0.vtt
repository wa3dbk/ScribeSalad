00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.741
So far everything I've talked about really applies to every programming

00:00:02.741 --> 00:00:05.854
language. In fact, it applies to lots of things beyond programming. Whether

00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:10.540
you're designing a house, designing a company, planning and event. All of those

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.950
things benefit from doing things in a modular way and thinking about how to

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.523
break the problem down into small pieces with clean interfaces. Now we're going

00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:21.070
to talk about some of the specifics of how to actually do this in python. And in

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.914
Python we can divide a program into modules which are really just separate

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.012
files. In order for one file to use another file, once we have divided our

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:33.228
program into separate files, in order to use what's in one file in the other

00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:37.202
file, we need to import. We can thus using the syntax import followed by the

00:00:37.202 --> 00:00:41.490
module name. So if we're in the file a dot py and we want to use something from

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.641
b dot py. We will just do import b. Python will look for a file named b.py.

00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:50.428
That's the simplest case, and it will find it in the current directory. If it

00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:55.637
doesn't find that file there, there are other ways it will look for a module.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:58.936
And it will look on a path of directories to find it, but the ones that create

00:00:58.936 --> 00:01:02.434
yourself will probably be in the same directory as the file that you're working

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:06.522
on. Until your programs get really complicated and then you'll organize those

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:10.456
into directories as well. We've used import before and you've seen the import

00:01:10.456 --> 00:01:14.585
"urllib" in some of the code that, that used in search engine. This was used to

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:18.996
be able to use a function to get a page from the web. We didn't define this

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:23.724
ourselves and if you look in the directory there's no "urllib" dot py file. This

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:28.203
is a module provided by the Python library. Since we didn't define this

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:32.974
ourselves, Python will search for this on the path until it finds it. We can see

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:38.694
what that path is by doing import sys to import the sys module, and then looking

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:44.214
at the value of path defined in the sys module, and we see this long path. Your

00:01:44.214 --> 00:01:47.682
results will very depending on how you installed Python and what platform you're

00:01:47.682 --> 00:01:51.768
working on. The specifics that you see here will depend on your Python

00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:56.080
installation. You should see the first entry is the current path. There's an

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.380
empty directory here, meaning it's always going to look in the current directory

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.530
first, but then it's going to look in a bunch of different library directories

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.749
to try to find the packet you're looking for. The other thing want to point out

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:11.042
here. Is the syntax I used here. This is the way that obtain a definition from a

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:15.396
module. So, we imported this module to act as the definition from that module,

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:18.938
we need to sue the module followed by a dot. And then, we can access the

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:22.900
definitions in that module. What this means is that modules avoid name space

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.640
pollution. If we didn't have to use the module to reference definitions in the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.412
imported files. Well then everytime we imported a file, we'd have to worry

00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:34.716
about, does it use any names that we use, and are we going to lose our own

00:02:34.716 --> 00:02:39.483
definitions and have pollution that way? The way Python avoids that is by, when

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:44.795
you import a module, all the names to find in that file are only visible inside

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:49.960
the module, followed by the module, dot the name. This means that if you had

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.680
your own path variable and then you import sys, the value of path hasn't

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.343
changed.
