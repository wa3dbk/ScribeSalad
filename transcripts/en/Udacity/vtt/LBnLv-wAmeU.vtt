00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.977
For the second one, you need to type in the nthroot and a space. This will

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:07.636
create this radical symbol. Your cursor bar will appear here, and you'll need

00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:10.350
to hit the Right Arrow key and then type in 5 to get what's underneath the

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.129
radical. These would be the keystrokes for our third expression. Notice that

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.106
after we type in the square root symbol, we don't need to hit the Right Arrow

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:23.178
key. That's because the index for this root is assumed to be a 2, It's rare

00:00:23.178 --> 00:00:28.320
that you'll ever see it, but we know it's a square root. That's why it's a 2.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.103
Math Quill knows it's 2, and so you're just placed back inside the radical. And

00:00:32.103 --> 00:00:36.166
then you can type in 21. Now for this last expression, you might not have any

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:40.600
idea what i is. That's okay. We're going to cover this later. To start this

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.240
expression, I would type in a forward slash. This would create an entire

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.199
fraction with a spot for a numerator and the denominator. We type in these

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.545
keystrokes in order to get our entire numerator. And notice that our cursor bar

00:00:53.545 --> 00:00:56.747
is here. Once we type in the 6, our cursor bar will appear here, and then we

00:00:56.747 --> 00:01:01.840
hit the Right Arrow key twice in order to move it down to the denominator.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.308
Then, we just type a 4 to wrap up our expression. Now, there are other ways

00:01:05.308 --> 00:01:08.634
that you can have done this to recreate the fraction bar. You could've created

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:13.080
the fraction bar after the 6. But that means, this forward slash would go in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.600
between these 2 errors. After you type the 6, you're still inside the radical.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.390
So, if you type the forward slash here, you'll create a fraction within the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.010
radical. You don't want that to happen, so you hit the Right Arrow key once.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.890
Which moves the cursor bar outside of the radical, and then you can type a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.010
forward slash to create your fraction, hit the Right Arrow key again to move to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.095
the denominator and then enter 4 to finish up. Either way you do this last one

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:39.939
is correct, I just want you to get comfortable using math quill.
