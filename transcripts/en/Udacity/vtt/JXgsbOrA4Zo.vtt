In lots of applications, you need to read many inputs. Here, when you look at

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:08.477
these adorable kittens, of course, you want to pet them all. But if you're a

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:11.662
vet, you might also need to know their weight, their average weight, which

00:00:11.662 --> 00:00:16.175
one's the largest, which one's the smallest, and so on. So, a program that

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:20.982
processes data like that needs to read in all of that information. It needs to

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:25.440
specifically, in this case, read in the weight of every kitten. So, we might

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.779
want to prompt to enter the first weight, the user enters first kitten weighs

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.596
100 grams. We get the prompt for the second weight, the user enters, prompt for

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:38.352
the third weight and so on. Well, when do we stop? Maybe we could have asked

00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:42.347
the user how many values are you going to enter? Now, that's a little clumsy,

00:00:42.347 --> 00:00:45.976
particularly when there's lots of values. There's a common solution to this

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:51.837
problem. And that is to ask the user to enter some input, that definitely can't

00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:58.180
be the right value. In this case here, we might ask the user to enter 0,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:06.995
because no kitten can weigh 0 grams. Such a value is called a sentinel value.
