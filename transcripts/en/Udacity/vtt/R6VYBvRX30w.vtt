00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.835
To solve this one, the three elements you need to determine are the axis, angle

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:09.301
of rotation and the sign. In other words, which direction you're rotating. The

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:13.955
green axis is the one we want to rotate around, and so this is the y axis. For

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:18.348
the angle of rotation, there are 360 degrees in a circle. We want to rotate 2

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:23.204
12ths of the way around the circle. So that's 60 degrees. We also need to rotate

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:28.202
in a negative direction, since the positive direction is counter clockwise. So

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:33.523
the sign is negative here. All this information is encapsulated in this line of

00:00:33.523 --> 00:00:38.052
code, y rotation, negative 60 degrees. There's more than one solution to this

00:00:38.052 --> 00:00:42.688
problem. Since we can't tell which end is which. We could instead rotate 120

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:47.400
degrees counter clockwise and get the same answer, which would let us put a

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.513
positive angle.
