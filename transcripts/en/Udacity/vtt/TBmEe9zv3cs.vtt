00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.086
A squared minus 2a minus 3 divided by the quantity, a squared plus a minus 1 is

00:00:06.086 --> 00:00:11.166
correct. I hope these are getting easier. We know the LCD must be a times a

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:16.428
minus 1. Since these are the only factors that appear in our denominators. We

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:21.888
multiply the fraction by the LCD divided by the LCD, so we really multiply each

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:26.887
of these terms by the number a times a minus 1. For our first term the a is

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:31.978
reduced to 1. So we're left with a plus 3 times a minus 1. For the second term

00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:37.395
the a minus 1s cancel, leaving us with negative 4 times a. And this is why you

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:41.288
want to be really careful to pay attention to this sign. We have negative 4 a

00:00:41.288 --> 00:00:46.656
not positive 4 a, and in our denominator we're left with a times a which is a

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:51.420
squared, and 1 times a minus 1. We add that as our second term in the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.120
denominator. If we multiply these two together we'll get a squared plus 2a minus

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.281
3. Our denominator just has the terms a squared plus 1 a minus 1 we combine our

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:07.471
like terms to get negative 2a for our numerator. Now, we definitely want to try

00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:12.531
to see if we can simplify this more, but I know I can't. I can't find factors of

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:17.749
negative 1 that sum to positive 1, so we're really done. The numerator can be

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:21.844
factored, but again this doesn't help us out, since we can't cancel a factor

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:27.053
that appears here with one that appears here. This is our final answer.
