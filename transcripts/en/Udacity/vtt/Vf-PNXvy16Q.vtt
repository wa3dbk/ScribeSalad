00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the beginning, you do have some initial observation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
&gt;From this initial observation, we derive a hypothesis.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A possible explanation for what you just observed.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If the hypothesis explains your observation, the hypothesis must be useful to make a prediction.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In our example, the initial observation was the apple falling.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The hypothesis would be, well every solid objects falls down and then a prediction would be,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
if I take this plate and let it fall, it's going to go straight down towards the floor.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It may also break along the way. This is what 3 years old do.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The experiment means to actually verify the prediction so we take the plate and let it fall.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
&gt;From the experiment comes the observation. What do you see?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well, the plate actually was attracted towards the ground and so you can now go

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and check whether what you just observed in your experiment is as predicted

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and therefore satisfy the hypothesis and we say it supports the hypothesis

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and we then can refine the hypothesis.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Our case line says, we can generalized it towards other objects

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and to come up with a more general hypothesis.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If the observation, however, is not in line with your prediction, then the hypothesis is rejected,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and if the hypothesis is rejected, you need to come up with a new hypothesis,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and this cycle going along from hypothesis through prediction through experiment through observation

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and gradually refining the hypothesis or coming up with alternatives.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is something you repeat again and again until your hypothesis

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
becomes consistent with all observations and has so much predictive power

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that it becomes what one calls a theory.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In a theory you repeat the process of refining the hypothesis through prediction, experiment,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
observation or creating new hypothesis--again going through the circle again and again and again

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
until your hypothesis becomes a theory

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that is a predictive and comprehensive description of some aspect of reality.
