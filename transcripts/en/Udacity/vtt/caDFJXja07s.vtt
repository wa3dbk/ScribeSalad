00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:04.022
So the last processor to arrive at the root

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:08.061
of the tree, in this case P5. He's the guy

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:10.474
who is going to start the waking up process for

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:13.288
everyone, and the way the wake up process works is

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:16.102
that P5, having realized that he has reached the

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:18.916
root of the tree and having realized that he's the

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:21.730
last one to arrive, because count is already zero

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.350
after you decremented it, he's going to flip this locksense flag.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.512
So, when he flips this locksense flag, what's going to

00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:32.600
happen? Two things, one is this guy, P3, he's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.760
waiting on this locksense flipping. So he's going to be

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.850
released from the spin he's on. Of course, P5 has

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.550
reset the count back up to n to prepare

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.110
for the next barrier and it has flipped the locksense.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.420
So freeing up P3 and it is now ready to go down the tree as well to tell his

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.830
buddies that the barrier is done and wake

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.960
up everyone along the way. So the wakeup starts

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.870
from the root. And, so in this case P5

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.459
and P3 having been released from the root, they

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.810
go, come down to the next level. And they're

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.150
going to wake up their buddies that are waiting at

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.954
this level of the tree. Remember I told you

00:01:11.954 --> 00:01:16.640
that this can be a kauri tree. K happens

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.280
to be two in this case. But for any

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.960
general K, basically at every level of the tree, there's

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.235
going to be on K minus 1 buddies waiting here,

00:01:24.235 --> 00:01:28.820
K minus 1 buddies waiting here. So what we're going to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.821
do is we're going to release that many number of

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:37.060
prisoners from every level of the tree. So this is

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.380
the zeroth level of the tree. There's the first level

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.630
of the tree. There's the second level of the tree.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.750
And at the zeroth level, there is k minus

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.190
1 buddies. At the first level, there is k times

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.660
k minus 1 buddies waiting. And similarly as you

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.560
go down the different levels of the tree, there're more

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.620
and more buddies waiting to be released. So for

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.970
this simple example, with the K equal to two, so

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.960
when he comes up here, comes down to this

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.570
level, P3 is going to release P0 and P5 is going to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.100
release P6. And so now we have more helpers, to go down the tree and wake up

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.230
more people. So at this level only P5 was there to wake up P3, and at this level

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.410
both P3 and P, P5 are there to wake

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.215
up the respective buddies, P0 in this case, and

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:31.740
P6 in this case. So once P0 and P6 have been woken up, there are four of them

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.360
now available that can go down to the next level

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.220
of the tree. And they can go down to the next

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.300
level of the tree. P0 can wake up, his buddies

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.020
at this level of the tree, P3 his buddies at this

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.520
level, P5, and P6. And so now all the others,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.050
so P1 in this case P2 in this case, P4 in

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.230
this case, and P7 in this case, were all been waiting

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.140
at this level of the tree, they will all get awakened

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.700
because of these guys marching down from the root. And

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.360
basically what each of these guys are doing on the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.860
way down is to flip this locksense flag. So the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.410
first thing that P5 did was to flip the locksense flag

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.600
over here. That released this guy. And when, when P3

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.190
and P5 come to this level of the tree, each

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.730
of them respectively flip the locksense flag that is associated

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.720
with this data structure and when they do that, P5 release

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.710
P6, P3 release P0 and now both P0, P3, P5 and P6 on this side.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.100
They all can go down to the next level. And P0 can flip locksense over here, P3

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.230
can flip locksense over here, P5 over here,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.310
P6 over here. That is going to release the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.400
rest of the buddies, P1, P2, P4, and

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.560
P7. And everybody has now been released from the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.450
barrier, and that signals that the spin is done for all the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.860
ba, the processes that I've been

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.500
waiting, and, the barrier completion is complete.
