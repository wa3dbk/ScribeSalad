00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.027
Here are the methods we have learned so far to solve quadratic equations. We

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:07.611
first started by reviewing factoring. Then we looked at the root method, and

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:11.746
finally, we completed the square. Factoring is perhaps the easiest method if we

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:15.690
can factor a quadratic equation. If we can't factor it, then we'll want to use

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.008
one of these two approaches in order to get our solution. And if none of these

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:24.714
three methods will work, we have one last method that will always work. That

00:00:24.714 --> 00:00:28.760
method is the quadratic formula. There are some advantages and disadvantages to

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.174
this method. Let's see what they are. For any equation written in this form, we

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:37.962
can find the solutions to it by doing negative b plus or minus the square root

00:00:37.962 --> 00:00:45.080
of b squared minus 4ac, all divided by 2a. This is our quadratic formula and it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.098
only requires that we know the values of a, b, and c. a is the coefficient of

00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:53.056
the x squared term, b is the coefficient of the x term, and c would be the

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:58.680
constant term. I mentioned the pros and cons of this quadratic formula. Well,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.276
the pro is that it can solve any quadratic equation, so long as we have the a,

00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:07.164
b, and c, and the left-hand side is set equal to 0. We could also have the

00:01:07.164 --> 00:01:10.002
equation reversed, the left-hand side could be 0 and the right-hand side could

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:14.564
be this. For the cons, it's actually very easy to make a sign error in two

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:18.546
places. Here, we need to take the negative value of b, so if to change the

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:22.263
sign. The other place that we might make a sign error is underneath the

00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:26.580
radical. b squared should always end up being a positive number, and then we

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.450
have minus 4ac. Now, depending on the values of a and c, this second term might

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.033
end up being positive or it might stay negative. You'll want to pay close

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:39.810
attention to how many negative signs you have here to determine this number.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.860
And finally, another drawback to the quadratic formula is that we have to

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.540
simplify. We'll need to simplify this radical. And then we'll also need to

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.113
simplify this fraction if we can. Sometimes, this result will end up being the

00:01:51.113 --> 00:01:55.140
integers, and sometimes, it will end up being fractions. Keep in mind that we

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.070
could get imaginary solutions if we have a negative radical here.
