00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.303
Xavier and his brother Benjamin always feel sleepy during the day. Xavier

00:00:05.303 --> 00:00:09.591
thinks he shouldn't feel so tire because he knows he sleeps during the night,

00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:15.464
unlike his brother Benjamin who never falls asleep or stays asleep. Xavier

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:19.299
doesn't have trouble falling asleep but does, on occasion, feel that he comes

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:24.140
in and out of sleep throughout the night. Benjamin told Xavier that his

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.544
breathing sounded weird and inconsistent while he sleeps. What sleep disorders

00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:36.593
do you think the brothers have? Xavier probably has what? And Benjamin probably

00:00:36.593 --> 00:00:42.082
has what? Here are some options. Narcolepsy, sleep apnea, night terrors, and

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:43.269
insomnia.
