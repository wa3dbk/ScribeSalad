00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.280
So here I am, back at the code again and if

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.670
I scroll down, you will notice that I made one change to

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.520
the code, which is, that I added an if statement to print

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.020
out more easily readable output messages. Let me run the code now.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.930
Aha. The program says that there is a profane word

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.780
in the movie_quotes document. And if I go back

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.560
to my movie_quotes document, I can find the culprit

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.700
word. So, let me go ahead and quickly change that.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.180
So, I will change that back and save this document and now, if I run my code, I

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.230
get a message saying no curse words were found.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.970
Alright, the second step in our program is also done.
