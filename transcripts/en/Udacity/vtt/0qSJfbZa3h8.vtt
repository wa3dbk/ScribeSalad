00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340
For our first quiz, what I would like you to figure out for this genetics network here

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.040
is the largest group of genes that you can select so that every selected gene

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.380
is connected to every other selected gene.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.230
What is the largest group of genes where every gene is connected to every other gene.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.230
You've already seen that we can find a group of three genes where every gene is connected

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.710
to every other gene, but may be you can find a larger one.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.750
The way I want you to answer this quiz is just to check off the genes that belong to this group.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.670
Which genes do we have to select so that we have the largest possible group of genes

00:00:38.670 --> 99:59:59.000
where every gene is connected to every other gene.
