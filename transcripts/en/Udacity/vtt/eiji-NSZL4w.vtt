00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.726
Here, the possible solutions for p are between negative 2 3rds and positive 1

00:00:04.726 --> 00:00:09.627
3rd. Now, that's amazing problem solving if you got this one correct. To start

00:00:09.627 --> 00:00:13.814
this problem, we want to subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality. This

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:18.244
gives us a quadratic expression on the left and zero on the right. Now, we

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:22.315
want to find the 0s or the values of p that make this quadratic expression

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:29.014
equal to 0. We find factors of negative 18 that summed to positive 3. Those two

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:33.230
factors are positive 6 and negative 3, and we use them to rewrite the middle

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.900
term of plus 3p. Using factoring by grouping, we get the factors 3p plus 2 and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.638
3p minus 1. Next, we set each factor equal to zero, and then we solve for the

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:51.060
values of p, so p could equal negative 2 3rds or p could equal positive 1 3rd.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.067
Next, we use our two zero ro values to create three different intervals. And

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:58.666
now, it's just a matter of testing each one to see which ones are part of the

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:04.248
solution. For the first interval, we'll plug in p is equal to negative 1. When

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:08.222
we plug in this value for p, we'll get this statement, 4 is less than 0. We

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:12.187
know this statement is not true, so we exclude this interval from our solution

00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:16.967
set. For the second interval, we'll test the value of zero. We know zeros in

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:20.477
between these two fractions, since one of them is negative and the other one is

00:01:20.477 --> 00:01:25.813
positive. When we plug in p equals 0, we get the statement negative 2 is less

00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:31.755
than 0. This is definitely true, so this part is part of our solution set. For

00:01:31.755 --> 00:01:35.415
the third interval, we'll test p equals 1 and we'll get the statement 10 is

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:40.302
less than 0. We know this is false, so this is not part of our solution, which

00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:45.232
leaves us with this interval only. Any value between negative 2 3rds and

00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:50.440
positive 1 3rd will make our original inequality true. We also use parentheses

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.720
here and in our interval notation since this is just a less than than symbol.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840
We can't be equal to zero.
