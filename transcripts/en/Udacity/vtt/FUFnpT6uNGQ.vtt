00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.533
Remember, that when we add and subtract complex numbers, the imaginary parts are

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:11.842
like terms and the real parts are like terms. So we end up with 1 plus 3i plus

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:19.929
the quanity negative 6 plus 2i equals negative 5 plus 5i. 1 plus 3i minus the

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:25.867
quanity negative 6 plus 2i gives us 7 plus i. When we multiply complex numbers,

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:30.742
this needs to happen by distributing in the same way that we did with binomials

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:37.034
involving, involving variables. The quantity 1 plus 3i times the quantity

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:44.710
negative 6 plus 2i, gives us negative 6, plus 2i, minus 18i, plus 6i squared.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.222
Which when simplified, gives us negative 6, minus 16i, minus 6 or negative 12

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:58.604
minus 16i. And lastly, when we divided complex numbers, the final thing we need

00:00:58.604 --> 00:01:03.068
to do is to make the denominator into a real number, so that we can just let it

00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:07.910
modify the coefficients of the real and imaginary parts of the denominator. To

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.350
change the denominator in this way, we multiply both the denominator and the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.540
numerator by the complex conjugate of the original denominator. So, negative 6

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.931
minus 2i in this case. Now let's look at the problem. 1 plus 3i, divided by

00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:33.756
negative 6 plus 2i, gives us 1 plus 3i, times the conjugate negative 6 minus 2i,

00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:41.371
divided by negative 6 plus 2i, times negative 6 minus 2i. Simplifying further,

00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:49.989
we got negative 6 minus 2i minus 18i minus 6i squared, divided by 36 minus 4i

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:59.378
squared. Which gives us negative six minus 20i plus 6, divided by 36 plus 4 or

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:05.843
negative 20i over 40, and finally negative i over 2.
