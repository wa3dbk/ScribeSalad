00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.937
Let's do a few more questions like the last one. For each of these three

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.217
equations, please take the second line of boxes to fill in the operation that

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.302
you do on either side of the equation, in order to isolate x in the last step.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.692
In each of these teal boxes, please fill in your final answer for what you think

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:21.146
x should equal. Then when you're done, make sure that you take that number and

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:25.365
substitute it back into the original equation to make sure that it actually is a

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:25.846
solution.
