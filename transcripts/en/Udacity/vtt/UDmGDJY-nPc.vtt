Thanks, Kai/g. It looks like the picture class has some other methods. In

00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:07.515
BlueJ, I'm going to create a picture object as we've been doing. And I'm going

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.162
to fill it with a picture of Jonathan, and here's my picture of Jonathan. I'm

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:16.680
going to translate it a little. Translate, and 100. Jonathan can't wait to grow

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.370
up. Are there any methods in the picture class that we could use to help him

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.800
out? Let's see. Which of these methods might help him grow up? What about the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.470
grow method? If I enter 50 and 50 and then hit OK, what will happen? Does

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.060
Jonathan grow 50 pixels wider and 50 pixels taller? Does Jonathan grow 50%

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.716
bigger? Does Jonathan grow 50 pixels on each side? Or does Jonathan grow 50

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:41.874
years older?
