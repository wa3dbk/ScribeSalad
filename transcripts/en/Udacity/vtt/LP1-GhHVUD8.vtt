00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.190
Sometimes we can't hide the implementation of a design decision

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.100
inside a single method or class.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.130
It's just too big.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.580
Martin's Common Closure Principle says that regardless of

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.170
the level of granularity that we are forced to use,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.300
we should group the related elements into a common release unit.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.310
In Java, this would typically be a package.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.110
Stated succinctly, this principle says that classes that change together,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.100
should be released together.
