00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So the consequences of understanding a new market are essential for a startup.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This was a startup killer for decades.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In a new market, there are no customers, so revenues might extend out for years.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, if you think about what happened during the dot-com bubble,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in the beginning of the 21st century is every startup executed like they were in an existing market.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They hired sales people, they spent marketing dollars, and in scale of tens of millions or dollars

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
trying to create and use your demands for a market that didn't exist.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Just imagine what would've happened if those start-ups would've parked their capital in a bank

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
getting interest and doing ??? activities to help start the market because the market wasn't there.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There is no way any individual startup can accelerate technology diffusion.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So for a new market to take off, lots of things external to your startup need to happen.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Regulation needs to change. Platforms need to become cheaper.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Customer cases need to change, etc.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The dot-com bubble was actually predicated on all these things happening all at once

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and they didn't, and therefore, all that money that got raised

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
got spent trying to acquire customers when they were none.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The test for whether you're in a new market is not whether 30 people in your regional cluster,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
or in Silken Valley, or New York have heard about your technology.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The real test is whether your grandmother in Omaha or Berlin or in Uganda

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
actually have heard about the technology or the product or the market.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And if the market doesn't exist there, you might be spending a lot of money

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
trying to create a market where there is none.

00:01:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Premature spending is the killer for startups.
