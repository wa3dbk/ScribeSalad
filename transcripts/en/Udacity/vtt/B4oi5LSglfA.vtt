In the demo, when the texture is warped there's a crease down the middle of our

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.684
square from upper right to lower left. What is the root cause of this

00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:10.540
discontinuity? The original texture was stretched or distorted before the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.878
corner was moved. The Three.JS system is broken. The square is made of a fine

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:18.949
mesh of little triangles. The square is made of two triangles.
