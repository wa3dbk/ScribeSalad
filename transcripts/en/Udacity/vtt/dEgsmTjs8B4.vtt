00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
And the third problem which is undecidable is a problem called specification,

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.510
and that problem basically asks--does a program do what it is suppose to do.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.090
And that problem in the general case is also undecidable because determining the equivalence

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.520
of two programs is basically the same as using one of the programs

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.080
as a specification for what the other one does.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.130
Unfortunately even determining if a program is correct cannot be done automatically,

00:00:26.130 --> 99:59:59.000
at least not in a general case and we'll get to the special cases at the end of this unit of course.
