00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
These easy-to-write FSMs that we've been using

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that involve epsilon transitions or ambiguity--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
remember, ambiguity means that I can go to 2 different places on the same input--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
are formerly known as non-deterministic finite state machines.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Non-deterministic here just means that you may not know exactly

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where to go or where to put your finger.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's not lock-step. You have choices.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You have freedom.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
A lock-step FSM with no epsilon transitions

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and no ambiguity by contrast is called a deterministic finite state machine.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Everything is determined from the start.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Given the finite state machine and the input, you always know

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
exactly what will happen.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Our finite state machine simulation procedure can handle

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
deterministic finite state machines.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That makes them really useful for implementing regular expressions

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
under the hood.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let me just show you an example of this non-determinism just to drive it home.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Suppose we were back here in this previous finite state machine,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but now the input is 1-23.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Where are we?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We started here, and on a 1 we went here,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and then I guess if we're supposed to stay alive and there's a hyphen,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we must have gone here and taken the hyphen.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And now there's a 2, but now this is really not obvious.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I could stay here on this self-loop for a 3,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or I could have gone back on this free epsilon transition

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and done the self-loop here on a 3, so I could be in state 2 or state 5.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Since there isn't one single answer for where I could be,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
this is non-deterministic.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
As a bit of a fun aside, this notion of determinism

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
or non-determinism can be related to the question of free will in philosophy.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Can we actually make independent choices?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Or is everything preordained by the current state of the world

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and forces acting on it, like a lock-step game of billiards or snooker or pool?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Some philosophers will approach this by suggesting that we have

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the illusion of free will--that's a disconcerting thought--

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
which is handy for describing subjective experience.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We certainly often feel like we have free will.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Regardless of what's going on in the real world,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we're going to see that something similar holds

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
for finite state machines.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Although non-deterministic finite state machines look like they have

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
much more power and much more freedom,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
anything that could be done with them could also be done

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in our deterministic billiard ball world.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
In fact, you can watch me suck free will out of this world right now.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Every non-deterministic finite state machine

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
has a corresponding deterministic finite state machine

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that accepts exactly the same strings.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Non-deterministic finite state machines are not any more powerful

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
than deterministic finite state machines.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
They're just more convenient.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's easier to write them down.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Let's see an example of this extraordinary claim.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Suppose we have this regular expression.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
There are only 2 strings in the language of this regular expression,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
but here I've drawn out a very elaborate finite state machine for it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that has epsilon transitions coming out the wazoo.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is very non-deterministic.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We definitely need to see an a, but then here these 2 epsilon transitions

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
represent the explicit choice.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Do I do the b, or do I skip over it?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
On the top road, we need to see the b.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
On the bottom road, we skip entirely past it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And then in any event, we need to see the c.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'm now going to write a deterministic finite state machine

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that does exactly the same thing, and I'm going to hint at

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
how this conversion works.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We'll see this again in just a minute.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
After I see an a, I could be in 2,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
or I could take the epsilon to 3.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I could have taken the epsilon down here to 6

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
or all the way over to 4, so there are 4 places

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I could be in.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
That's a lot of fingers.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I'll just record all of them as the name for my new state, 2364.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
From here, if I see a b and I survive--remember, finite state machines work

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
if there's any path that gets to the end--it must have been that I was in state 3,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
at which point now I'm just in state 4.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
By contrast, if I was back here and I saw a c,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
it must have been that I was in state 4, and now I'm in state 5.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And then finally, if I'm in state 4 and I see a c,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I end up here, so this deterministic finite state machine

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
accepts the same language as the one above.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The 2 strings, a, b, c, and a, c

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are both in it, but it does not have

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
epsilon transitions or ambiguity.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
In any particular node, there are never 2 edges going out labeled a,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and there are never epsilon transitions.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Let's see another example of how this works.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Again, I'm going to build a deterministic machine

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
where every state in the deterministic machine

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
corresponds to a set of states

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in the non-deterministic one.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Again, to restate that, you give me a non-deterministic machine,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I'm going to build you a deterministic machine d

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
that accepts the same language, and the way I'll do it is

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
every state in d is going to correspond to a set of states

00:05:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
in the non-deterministic machine you gave me.
