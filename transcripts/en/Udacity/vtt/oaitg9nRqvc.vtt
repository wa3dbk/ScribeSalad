00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.091
Great.

00:00:02.091 --> 00:00:04.447
Now that you have the structure of the page down,

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:07.563
you can work on making it look like the design you were provided.

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:12.960
Now to do this, you need to use CSS or Cascading Style Sheets.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.460
Now you can probably assume that style means looks or

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.750
the way that the web site will appear to the user.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.790
But what do cascading and sheets mean?

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.120
First, you can have several CSS files or

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.610
sheets that will be referenced in HTML and

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.650
all of them will be used to find out the final and visible style for your page.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.210
Think of it in terms of laws.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.770
You have a national law that deals with how your country is organized and then

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.910
you might have state laws, which tell you can or cannot do in a given state.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.612
And then you might have municipality laws, which specify what you can or

00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:55.165
cannot do in your city.

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:58.939
And then at the end, you might have your own house rules.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:01.210
Well, CSS is a bit different.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.369
Because with CSS the most specific rule is applied to every element.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.070
So your house rules would actually be the same as the national laws.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.450
Wouldn't this be awesome if this was true in real life?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.500
For example, I went to school in Orlando.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.569
And I made it a rule that we did theme park Mondays.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.244
Meaning, if I had time on Monday, I went to the theme park.

00:01:23.244 --> 00:01:24.880
It was a house rule.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.470
Wouldn't that be great if it was national law?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.870
I can go to a theme park every Monday.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.800
Now, this concept of most specific rule applied is what

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.160
the word cascading means.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.790
You keep going down and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.490
down into the rules until you find the one that best describes the elements.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.240
And then that rule gets applied
