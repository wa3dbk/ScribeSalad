00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.940
Hey, there.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.820
Welcome to Algorithms and Data
Structures for Technical Interviewing.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.950
My name is Brin and
I'll be your guide and mentor.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.500
My job is to teach you how to invent
efficient solutions to unsolved problems

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.700
using algorithms and data structures.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.230
A skill you need both in a job and
to get a job.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.220
Algorithm is a fancy word for

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.169
something straightforward,
a program that solves a problem.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.550
At the start of this course, algorithms
might seem a bit like a magic trick.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.922
[SOUND] You see the input to the trick,

00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:38.956
and you see the output from the trick.

00:00:38.957 --> 00:00:41.750
But everything that happens in
the middle seems pretty mystical.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.160
My goal is to teach you the steps
involved with the trick and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.839
to explain what resources you'll
need to pull off the trick.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.850
In this analogy,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.630
the resources are often data structures
or a common pattern in the problem.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.480
After I've given you all the tools
you'll need, we'll do a little practice

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.378
to make sure you're ready to pull off
the tricks and technical interviews.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.790
However it's not my intention to
discuss every little detail like

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.490
the laws of physics or what each tool
is made out of at the molecular level.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.990
You'll be able to apply algorithms
to problems you'll face at work or

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.429
in an interview.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.740
But not use them at the level
of a mathematician.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.900
In a real technical interview you just
need to show that you can successfully

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.630
perform the trick and that you
understand the concepts behind it.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.310
I'm also not trying to
explain every concept

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.970
that could potentially
show up in an interview.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.160
I've designed this course to explain
topics that show up most often, but

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.900
you should definitely use this
course as a starting place and

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.460
continue to explore on your own.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.620
I should also note that I'm not
expecting any prior exposure to

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.960
algorithms or data structures.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.800
Just having the will to learn.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.300
You should have some familiarity
with our programming language and

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.290
have written some working code
with it before if you want

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.240
to understand the practice problems
that go along with the videos, but

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.589
soon I'll make sure we're on the same
page about exactly what that means.
