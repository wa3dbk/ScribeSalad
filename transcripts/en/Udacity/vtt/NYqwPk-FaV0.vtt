00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.330
The idea of a pipeline is that every object is dealt with once. Say, we have a

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.782
list of 52 parts for a car, each part represented by a set of triangles. Each of

00:00:08.782 --> 00:00:12.497
these parts is sent down the graphics pipeline and is rendered to the screen.

00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:15.990
Once an object goes through this process, we're done with it for the frame. If

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.455
we stop the process half way through and looked at the image formed, we'd see

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:23.196
only the first 26 car parts in the image. The advantage of a pipeline is that

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:27.297
each part of the pipeline can be worked on as a separate task at the same time.

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:31.476
Say, we take a trip to the local cardboard box factory. I won't describe what

00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:35.708
each step is because it's a box factory, that's pretty boring. All you need to

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:39.372
know is that each step takes the same amount of time. So let's say each stage

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:43.251
takes 10 seconds. If you want a single box, it'll take 30 seconds from start to

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:47.133
finish to make it. However, if you want a lot of boxes, a new box will arrive at

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:51.235
the end of the assembly line every 10 seconds. Let's see how that works. The red

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:55.646
box gets cut, that's 10 seconds. While red box is at a folding station, the

00:00:55.646 --> 00:01:00.308
yellow box follows behind and is now being cut at the same time. Each taking 10

00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:05.285
seconds. In the next 10 seconds, the red box is taped, the yellow box is folded,

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:09.520
and the blue box is cut, that's 30 seconds. After this point you can see another

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.920
box will come off the assembly line every 10 seconds.
