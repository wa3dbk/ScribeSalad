00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're going to rule out function as our best solution, because it was a bit too messy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But we learned in week ione that we have this incredible toll called the list comprehension.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's try that.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Using list comprehensions, we can solve this in one nice, elegant line of code.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This solution creates the exact same list that we created with our function,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and then it spits out the sum. Not bad, but it's not perfect.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What's the biggest problem with this solution?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
