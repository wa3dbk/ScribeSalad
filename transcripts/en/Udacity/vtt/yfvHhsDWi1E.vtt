00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.802
When finding the LCD we want to look at the denominators of all of our

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:10.666
fractions. So that would be x, 2 and 2x. Since x is a factor of 2x and 2 is a

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:16.740
factor of 2x we really just want this as our LCD. We want to take the product of

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.550
all of the different factors And their highest powers of any denominator. Great

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.234
thinking if you got 2x.
