00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.410
So what is a knowledge representation? The collage on this

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.900
screen shows several knowledge representations that AI has developed. In each

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.830
knowledge representation there is a language. That language has a vocabulary.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.910
Then, in addition to that language, in that knowledge representation there's

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.710
some content. The content of some knowledge. Let's take an example with which

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.500
you're probably already familiar. Consider the Newton's second law of motion.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.960
So I can represent it as f is equal to m a. This is a knowledge representation.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.280
A very simple knowledge representation, in which there are two things.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.650
There is a language of algebraic equations, y s equal to b x, for

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.220
example. And then there is the content of our knowledge of

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.240
Newton's second law of motion, force equals mass times acceleration.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.380
So the knowledge representation has two things, once again.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.440
The language, which has its vocabulary. For example, this sign of equality. And

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.340
the content that goes into that representation expressed in that language.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.180
Let us not worry too much about all of the representations in

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.110
this collage right now, we'll get to them later. The idea here is to

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.460
simply show that AI has developed not one, but many knowledge representations.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.880
Each representation has its own affordances and its own constraints.
