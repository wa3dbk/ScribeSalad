All we need to do to get our equation for a new parabola in vertex form is to

00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:08.408
look at the old equation in vertex form, and then shift the vertex up by 10.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:12.816
That means, the right side of the equation, which contains the horizontal

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:17.382
component of the vertex is not going to change at all. The only thing that will

00:00:17.382 --> 00:00:22.157
change is the constant added to y on the left-hand side. We need to subtract 10

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:27.037
from here since we will be up by 10, and this gives us an equation of y minus 7

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:32.225
equals negative 7 times x minus 1 squared. To get this in standard form, we just

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:36.941
need to multiply everything out and simplify. That gives us an answer of y

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:39.299
equals negative 7x squared plus 14x.
