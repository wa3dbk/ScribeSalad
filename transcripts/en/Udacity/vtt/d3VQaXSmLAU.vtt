00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.770
What does this have to do with images?

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.480
Well, let me tell you.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.308
I'm going to introduce this using the
notion of face images 'because frankly

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:10.904
it was this eigenvector approach to
doing face recognition that really,

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:12.753
I think, got people's attention.

00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:17.125
Think of an image now,
not as a two dimensional thing, but

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:20.620
as just one great big long vector.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.180
Okay?

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.490
So it's just got a whole
bunch of values in it.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.208
So for example, suppose I had
a vector that was 100 by 100 long.

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:29.292
How many pixels is that, Megan?

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:30.625
100 by 100.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:31.667
&gt;&gt; 10,000.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:32.167
&gt;&gt; 10,000.

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:32.833
You got it right.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.580
100 times 100 is 10,000.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.390
So, that's just a 10,000 long vector.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.500
If I don't worry about the fact that
they're pixels located in a particular

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.790
position, which, by the way, is going to
be an interesting problem later,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.733
if I just think of them as values,
that's a 10,000 dimensional space.

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.405
Right.
There's 10,000 dimensions,

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:54.755
each dimension has a value.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:56.055
What's the value?

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:59.855
It's the value of the pixel that
corresponds to that location.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:01.555
This location is another pixel.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:04.004
It's value 18, fine,
that's it's value here.

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:08.730
So the idea is that an image is
just a 10,000 dimensional vector.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.290
Question.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.550
How many of those 10,000
dimensional vectors,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.510
how many 100 by 100 pictures,
are actually pictures of faces?

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.450
I mean, just of a face?

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.680
Answer.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.460
Not a whole lot, okay?

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.870
In fact, most values, all right,
if I just randomly put numbers in tho,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.080
that vector.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.790
Right.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.905
I get out,
you know random pixels everywhere.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:33.760
Right?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.820
The idea is, that,
faces are a very special set of vectors.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.350
They're not all possible vectors, and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.482
they're not distributed
everywhere in this image space.

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.320
They are on some particular,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.630
what's referred to as a subspace,
sometimes a manifold, okay.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.480
They're in a subspace of all images.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.300
Okay?
By the way,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.360
we sometimes call that subspace,
face space.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.530
What's face space?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.390
Is the subspace in the space of images
that are the pictures of faces.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.190
All right.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.640
So here's what we want to do.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.860
We and this is color coded so
we want to build a low dimensional,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.630
because we're going to try to get a nice
dimensionality reduction going on here,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.470
linear, we'll talk about the use of
linearity to be able to just do dot

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.680
products together coefficient, subspace,
so it's going to be some reduced space,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.190
that explains most of
the variation seen in face images.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.400
And that's just drawn out here,
this looks just like what we had before.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.710
Where we had blue dots and,
and orange dots.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.450
Now I'm telling you well actually,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.450
even though this is drawn as
just a two dimensional space,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.257
'because I can only draw two,
it's a 10,000 dimensional space.

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:47.880
10,000.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.420
You like that.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.550
Okay, fine.
10,000 pixels and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.350
the idea is let me find the direction or

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.800
directions in that image along
which most of the face images lie.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.865
And that's what it shows here,

00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:04.950
that the cyan color is sort of, ideas
that the face images are there, and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.790
then we've got all these other
images that are not images of faces.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.180
They're cats, well they're all sorts of
things, okay, whatever the internet has

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.060
pictures of and
all other possible things, all right.
