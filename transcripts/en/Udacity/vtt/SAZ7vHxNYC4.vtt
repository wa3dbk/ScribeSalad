00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.850
Let's look at the solution to our tree height reduction quiz. We had this code,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.110
and we are trying to transform it through tree height reduction into something

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.960
that minimizes the overall number of cycles it takes to execute this code.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.280
Here, the code takes six cycles to do because each of the instructions depends

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.770
on the previous one. Now, when doing tree height reduction, what we need to do

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.950
is really figure out what is the expression that this is trying to compute. And

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.980
then, rewrite that expression. So, here's what we have here. We have R1 plus R2.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.370
Put the result in R10. Then subtract R3. Then add R4.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.910
Then subtract R5. Then add R6. Then subtract R7.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.850
So this is what we are trying to compute. How do we compute it with tree height

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.350
reduction? Well, the idea is to compute R1 and R2. That's what we're doing here.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.910
And then, compute the rest of the things and then add them up in R3.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.250
So here, what we need to do is we need to add up four numbers and then

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.640
subtract three numbers from that. So first, we will add up the four numbers.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.110
We already added up R1 and R2. Now we're going to add up R4 and R6. Next,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.490
the result of our two additions are going to be combined. So

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.970
we're going to add up what we have for R1 and R2 and what we have for R4 and R6.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.250
So now in R10 we have the R1 plus R2 plus R4 plus R6.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.036
Now we're going to subtract R3, R5 and

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:42.690
R7 from it. If we do it one at a time, that's going to be slow. So

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.000
what we are going to do is we are going to add up R3, R5 and R7 and

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.990
then subtract that from our R10. That's why we ave two adds here.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.550
So clearly, what we are doing here is we are simply adding up R3, R5. And

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.040
then R7 is added to that. So this needs to be R11.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.330
So now R11 has R3 plus R5 plus R7. And

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.220
now we subtract that from R10, and we get the final answer in R10.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.440
Now let us see how many cycles we need to do this. To do that,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.920
let's draw the dependencies. Here we have the dependence again. Like this.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.310
So each instruction needed to be done right after the previous one is done.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.980
Here there is no dependence between these two. There is a dependence here and

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.850
here. So the third instruction is to wait for the first two to complete.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.260
There is now, no dependence here. So this one can be done right away,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.550
even though it's the fourth instruction in our code. And

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.210
then there is a dependence here. And then finally, there is a dependence here,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.140
and also our final R10 here needs to be brought this way.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.090
So, if you look at what can be done in the first cycle, this can be done in

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.890
the first cycle, and so can this. This cannot because it has to wait. This can.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.660
So this is also done in the first cycle. And then, this has to wait for that and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.380
so on. So in our first cycle, we've already done three instructions,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.670
half of the instructions that we had. In the second cycle, we can do this,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.560
because these two complete in the first cycle. We can do this. Because it

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.830
only waits for this and that's been done. And, finally, in the third cycle we

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.593
have to do this because it has to wait for the results of the second cycle. So

00:03:33.593 --> 00:03:38.878
we have completed our six instructions now in three cycles and we've got

00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:44.602
an ILP of 2, which is twice as good as we had before the tree height reduction.
