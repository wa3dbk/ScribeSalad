00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.200
A lot of people get tripped up at this point,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.980
because they've forgotten that functions are just specialized objects.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.280
But in addition to the fact that functions have the power of being invoked,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.620
functions are also capable of storing properties just like any other object.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.440
Looking at the diagram again, you can imagine that the function object that is

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.250
referred to by the variable Car might have a .methods property pointing to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.570
the object that we're using to store all of our Car methods.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.920
It might be easier to reason about if you imagined that the Car

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.840
variable stored an object instead of a function.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.530
From this perspective, it's easy to imagine how the dot methods property

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.130
could be a property of the Car object.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.990
But I would like to remind you of how similar a function is to a regular object.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.700
In that, it's allowed to have properties just like any other object.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.430
It is also important to point out that there is no interaction between

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.630
the properties of a function and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.780
what you expect to happen when you invoke that function.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.660
The invocation of the function only makes the lines inside the body execute.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.040
Invoking a function has no interaction with any of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.060
the properties of that function.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.100
Now you might be tempted to imagine that because we've added a property to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.110
the Car function.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.970
Some interesting mechanism is going to be engaged or

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.040
some rules about how functions work will start to become active.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.030
But there aren't any interesting rules that will become active as a result of

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.490
the fact that we added a .methods property to the Car function.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.710
This is just simple property access, like we've always done.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.480
But this time, it's for

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.360
the purpose of decluttering the methods object out of the global scope.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.070
All we've done is moved our methods object out of the global scope.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
And there's nothing special about Car.methods.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.840
Other than that, it's conveniently tucked away as a property of Car.
