00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.545
The first thing that I notice when I look at this version of our term is that we

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:09.315
actually don't need these dots between the variables, and actually we don't need

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:13.810
a multiplication sign between 2 and x either. Inside a term the only place we

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:18.545
really need to explicitly indicate multiplication with the multiplication sign

00:00:18.557 --> 00:00:23.366
is between the constants. Factors, the reason that we really had to write them

00:00:23.378 --> 00:00:28.137
in between the 5, the 7, and the 2 before, was the dot, this didn't look like we

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.698
were writing 572 x, y, z. So to start off, I'm just going to get rid of those 3

00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:37.404
unnecessary multiplication signs. Remember if you kept them in, your term is

00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:42.983
still mathematically correct. It just contains a couple of extra symbols that

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:48.353
don't necessarily need to be there. So now we have this 5 times 7 times 2 to

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:54.058
deal with. Those are just numbers and we know how to multiply numbers together,

00:00:54.177 --> 00:01:02.157
5 times 7 is 35. And 35 times 2 is 70. So we can replace 5 times 7 times 2 with

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:08.255
70, and write the remaining factors afterward, xyz.
