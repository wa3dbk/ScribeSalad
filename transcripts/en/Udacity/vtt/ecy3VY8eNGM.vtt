00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.952
Well, we can't make any conclusive statements, but we only have the statistics

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:11.622
for this one sample, and so our best guess would be 40 since we have a sample of

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:17.613
people who just used the Bieber Tweeter, and the mean clout score of them is 40.

00:00:17.613 --> 00:00:22.219
This value, 40, is called a point estimate, and that's because it's only one

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:28.068
number. So this is our best guess for the population mean if everyone started

00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:29.970
using the Bieber Tweeter.
