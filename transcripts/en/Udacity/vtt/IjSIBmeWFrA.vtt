00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.350
Before you can do any
mapping applications,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.660
you need to get a key that gives you
access to the google maps android API.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.029
This is pretty easy to do, but

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.870
it involves taking a few steps out of
Android studio for the time being.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.250
You're going to be working in terminal.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.110
So as you can see,
I've opened my terminal here.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.000
The first thing you need is
the SHA1 fingerprint for your app.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.720
Google maps uses this as a way
to identify your application, so

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.770
it can give your app good service.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.345
This fingerprint is a machine readable
attribute of a certificate and

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:32.384
a certificate is a way of
determining that your app is real.

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:35.665
Just like in the real world,
a certificate is a sign of an authority,

00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:38.778
where you can call upon a third party
to certify that you are who you

00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:40.140
say you are.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.140
Now we're just going to use a debug
certificate for this as it's easier for

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.550
learning purposes.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.900
The debug certificate is
issued to you by yourself.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.490
Now later, if you want to release
your app to the play store,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.090
you'll need a publication certificate
which is verified by Google.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.950
If you want to do that,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.490
follow the instructions on
the developer website linked below.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.960
The first thing that you'll need to do
is to locate your key store file for

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.540
debugging using the terminal.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.470
It's called, imaginatively enough,
debug.keystore.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.770
On a Mac or Linux,
it's at cd ~/.android.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.110
So note that when you put a dot in front
of a folder like this it's usually

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.700
hidden so just know that
you may need to unhide it.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.970
If you're using Windows it'll be at
c:/user/ your user name /.android.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.290
Remember it could also
be hidden on windows.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.440
This is the directory that
contains the debug.keystore

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.340
nad I can use this to
get the fingerprint.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.010
And I'll show you how to do that next.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.820
The command to get the certificate
is the keytool command.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.460
And the keytool command,
you tell it your keystore.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.750
And you can see the keystore
location is .android/debug.keystore.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.120
You also just give it an alias.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.120
I'm calling it the androiddebugkey.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.060
And the password and username is just
android when you're using debug.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.160
So, when I press Enter, you'll see my
SHA key is listed in the certificate.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.986
The certificate fingerprints are here,
MD5, SHA1, and SHA256.

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:04.370
So, just keep track of the SHA1 key.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.620
I would just recommend leaving the
terminal window open because you will be

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.020
needing that data in a moment.
