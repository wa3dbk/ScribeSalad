00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.810
So far in this course, when you've
written SQL queries in the web-based

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.660
editor, we've hidden away the mechanism
that actually connects to a database and

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.470
runs your queries.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.370
Some place back here, there's actually
a database running those queries.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.540
Now, let's open up this box and
see how it actually works.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.640
Behind our web server,
we're running Python code

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.668
that connects to an sqlite
database using DB-API calls.

00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:27.260
The Python DB-API isn't a library.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.050
It's a standard for

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.320
Python libraries that let's your
code connect to databases.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.050
There are dozens of
different libraries for

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.850
different database systems
that follow this standard.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.663
The standard specifies what functions
you'll call to connect to a database,

00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:42.150
to send the queries and to get results.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.030
So, if you learn the DB-API functions,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.870
you can apply that knowledge
with any database system.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.280
Although, the details of what each
database can do are different,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.350
adapting Python code from one to
another is quite straightforward, but

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.790
each database system
has its own library.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.640
And as you can see,
some of the library names are a little

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.940
bit different from the names of
the database systems that we work with.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.720
For exercises in the browser,
we use the sqlite3 library.
