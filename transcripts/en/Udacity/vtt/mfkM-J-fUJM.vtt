00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.390
So, this is the second part
of our cache summary quiz,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.780
in the same cache that we have
seen in the previous quiz.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.740
Assuming that this is the sequence
of [INAUDIBLE] that happens and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.060
that the cache is completely empty at
start, meaning all of the valid bits

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.110
are zero, the question is, how many
misses do we have in this sequence and

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.870
how many blocks are written back
to memory during the sequence?
