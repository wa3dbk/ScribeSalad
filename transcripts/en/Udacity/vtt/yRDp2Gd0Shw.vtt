00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.330
Okay so now let us see how the AI
agent might go about building

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.120
an explanation that shows that
the object that have these properties

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.410
in fact is an instance of
this concept of a cup.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.870
What I'll do here is to first sketch
out the explanation for you and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.350
then I'll discuss how the AI agent
goes about building the explanation.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.530
Let us first consider this part.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.890
This is an abstraction that
we learn from the bowl.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.245
The object carries liquid
because it is concave.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:33.450
There is a similar abstraction
learned from the briefcase.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.700
The object is liftable because
it is light and it has a handle.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
Here's the abstraction that the air
agent learned from the glass.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.541
The glass enables drinking
because it carries liquids and

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.390
because it is liftable.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.730
So, in this way, the abstraction learned
from the glass gets connected to

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.560
the abstractions learned
from the bowl and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.810
the abstraction learned
from the brief case.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.700
Note that the effect here and
the abstraction from the bowl has become

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.610
the cause for the effect that was
the abstraction from the glass.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.940
Similarly here, the effected object is
liftable was learned from the briefcase

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.350
example, but in the context of
the glass, this becomes the cause for

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.290
object enables drinking.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.660
Let's shift to the fourth example for
brick.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.220
&gt;From there, one knows that the object
is stable because it is a bottom and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.910
the bottom is flat.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.830
Now, we can connect this causal
chain and this causal chain

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.480
into a more complex causal explanation
for why this object is a cup.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.490
The call that we had said earlier and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.160
the definition of a cup, that an object
is a cup if, it is stable and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.170
it enables drinking,
now we have shown that in fact,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.882
this particular object is a cup because
it is stable and it enables drinking.

00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:52.925
In practice when an A Agent actually
goes about building this explanation,

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:54.505
it works backwards.

00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:58.885
For the definition of the cup, it knows
that in order for an object to be a cup,

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:02.155
the object must be stable and
the object must enable drinking.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:05.206
So the A Agent's senses' goal
of proving that the object is

00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:07.415
stable into his memory.

00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:11.470
Memory returns the example of a brick,
because a brick is stable, but the brick

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.600
said that the brick is stable because
it has a bottom and the bottom is flat.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.830
So the air agent affects this causal
relationship from the brick example and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.920
applies it to the object here.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.390
Similarly for this part and
they asked for

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.190
the definition of the cup was
that it enables drinking.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.330
So how can the A agent prove that
the object enables drinking?

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.580
This object only exists in the kitchen.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.580
The air agent sensed the goal of proving
that the object enables drinking

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.030
induced memory.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.950
Memory returns the example for glass
because the glass enables drinking.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.180
It abstracts from glass the fact that
the object must carry a liquid and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.760
the object must be liftable
in order to enable drinking.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.280
That sets up some new
experiences with sub goals.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.780
How can the area agent now prove
that the object can carry liquid?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.140
That goes back into the memory, and
the example of a bowl is found.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.500
And I think you can now see how the rest
of the explanation process would work.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.195
Note this connects with a couple of
lessons we have learned earlier.

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:09.408
First you can see [INAUDIBLE]
reduction and application here.

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:11.275
Wanting to prove that object is a cup,

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:16.925
to do that we deduce the problem into
two smaller and simpler problems.

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:20.815
Let's prove that object is stable, let's
prove that object enables drinking, and

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:22.280
so on and so forth.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.620
Second this connects with
the notion of planning.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.200
When we were discussing planning
we had open preconditions.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.900
Those were preconditions of a goal
which we needed to satisfy.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.345
We use those open preconditions
to select operators,

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:37.475
a similar thing is happening here.

00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:40.195
When we want to prove that
the object is a cup, then we have

00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:44.335
two open preconditions, object is
stable, and object enables drinking.

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:49.015
These preconditions then become levels
while selecting explanatory proofs,

00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:53.260
explanatory fragments that can
help fulfill those preconditions.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.250
&gt;&gt; So the scenario of a robot
proving that an object is a cup is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.920
a bit of a longer term scenario.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.790
We're still a ways away from having
robots that walk around our house and

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.520
retrieve cups for us.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.910
To take an example perhaps from
the near future, I can imagine one day

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.610
having a word processor that has built
into it some intelligence such that,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.710
instead of choosing a file based
strictly on its file name,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.860
I can say something like, get me that
important document from last Tuesday.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.399
I myself might not remember
the filename or where I saved it, but

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.610
I remember that last Tuesday I was
working on an important document.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.530
The intelligent search in
the word processor would

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.930
then iterate over the documents and say,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.840
can I both prove that the document is
important and it is from last Tuesday?

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.110
Now the word processor might not have
a notion of importance built into it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.170
naturally, but it knows documents I
considered important in the past.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.020
And it might start to notice the
documents that have my header on them,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.570
and have my signature at the bottom,
are important.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.240
And from there,
it can start to build a case for

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.610
why that particular
document is important.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.510
Coupled with just being able
to read the time stamp and

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.980
see if it's from last Tuesday,
it should be able to retrieve for

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.150
me documents that might be both
important and from last Tuesday without

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.260
me ever really knowing what the document
file name was or where I saved it.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.300
&gt;&gt; This kind of explanation-based
learning actually occurs in our

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.610
everyday life.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.350
So you are now constantly improvising.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.870
Papers are blowing off my desk.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.670
How can I stop them from blowing off?

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.500
So I need something to stop
them from blowing away.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.680
What is other label what
can act as a paper weight?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.270
A cup.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.980
Here is a cup.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.346
Let me put it on the paper.

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:19.800
This is an example of improvisation
where we use explanation-based learning

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.270
to realize that this is how we use
a flat bottom can act as a paper weight.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.610
Here is another example.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.610
I need to prop open a door,
a door stopper is not available.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.700
What can I use?

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.320
Perhaps an eraser or a chair.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.090
You and I do this kind of improvisation
all the time, and often we are building

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.060
these explanations that tell us that
an eraser can be used as a door stopper.
