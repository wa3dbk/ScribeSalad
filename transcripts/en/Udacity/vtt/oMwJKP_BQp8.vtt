00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.550
Here's another example, a graphical example, of a state machine,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.258
using slightly different icons on things. In this case, ovals for the states.

00:00:09.258 --> 00:00:15.220
We have the telephone being off hook, we have it when you're dialing or pressing

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.530
the buttons. We have it when it's ringing, when it's busy when you are connected

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.640
to another party. And, when it's in a rest state on hook, on the extreme left.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.010
Notice in that case, that there are two ovals nested inside of each other.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.820
This is used to designate what the default or start state of the system is.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.060
There are then transitions, these directed arcs going,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.530
among the states. One to look at is the one on the top right labeled dialing,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.720
where it's a transition from a state to itself. That is, when you're dialing or

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.840
pressing the buttons, okay, you're doing this several times and,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.360
you remain in the dialing state until you've finished dialing. Now we could

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.430
have had a machine here that had numerous states as part of the dialing process,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.540
in which we've dialed the first digit, the second digit, and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.740
so on. And in that case, it would be different states.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.280
Until we eventually got entered our local number or

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.360
our our long distance number. That would have complicated the diagram, and

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.710
remember these diagrams, are abstractions. We abstract over the set of states,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.600
and abstract over the events. That's, that's your choice as a designer or

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.030
a modeler. Notice also that, the diagram is somewhat busy and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.360
that there are arcs that have a seemingly redundant labels.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.040
This is another example of a situation where we'd like to improve

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.173
the diagrams by by simplifying them. And that's where

00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:01.080
we're going when we get to concurrent systems model with statecharts.
