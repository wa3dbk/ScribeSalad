Alright, now that we've got some better tools, let's take a look at a bigger

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:09.975
piece of code. Now this is the entire base game engine class for the game that

00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:14.928
we're going to be building. Now, what I'd like you to do, is debug this much

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.376
larger piece of code.

00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:20.662
And to do this, you're going to need some help, otherwise, it's going to take

00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:25.091
far too long. Now, there are only a few syntax errors here. So, it's going to be

00:00:25.103 --> 00:00:29.273
a little bit hard to find them unless you use some tools, whether the Chrome

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:30.605
developer tools or some other browser's tools.
