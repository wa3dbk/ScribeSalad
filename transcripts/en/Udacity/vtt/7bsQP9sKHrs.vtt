00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.560
So first thing you probably notice about
tcpdump data is that there's a lot of

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.180
details here.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.560
What is all this options sack stuff?

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.417
We're not going to look
at that in this course.

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:12.570
I'm going to wave my magic
wand to make it go away.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.430
I know it's kind of silly to say,
but don't panic about the fact that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.030
this output probably looks
like a big pile of weird.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.996
Some parts of it may jump out at you
as already saying something, and

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:24.142
if not right now,
maybe by the end of this video.

00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:26.825
So there are some things in here
you might already recognize.

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:31.540
If you're using your own data, you'll
see your machine's IP address here.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.689
Here's mine.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.760
Notice the just as we saw with ping,
sometimes it shows up to the left of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.300
this little angle bracket and
sometimes it shows up to the right.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.890
That's because some of these
packets are going from our machine

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.700
to example.net and
some of them are coming back.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.040
Likewise, here's the IP address for
example.net.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.620
If you want to check that,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.590
you can use the host command
to look it up in the DNS.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.000
Now let's look at something that
differs across these packets.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.020
At the end of each record,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.240
there's a length field that's telling us
how much data was sent in that packet.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.510
That's just the payload,
the actual HTTP, data

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.850
as opposed to all the TCP overhead, like
addresses, import numbers, and such.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.000
So the interesting thing here is
that out of all of these packets,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.230
only a few of them even
have any payload data.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.510
For most of them, the length value is 0.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.330
This is an important fact about TCP.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.470
Even before the client and
server get to exchange any real data,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.180
they've got some set up to do
to bring up the connection.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.020
And after they're done with the real
data, they have some tear down to do.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.687
So looking at the first of
these that has any real data,

00:01:35.687 --> 00:01:39.939
it says length 38, and
the only other one has length 321.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.133
Well, where did those numbers come from?

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:45.050
Well, let's look back at
what data we actually sent.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.770
Here's our HTTP request, and
if you count these newline characters at

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.614
the end of each line as only one,
as the backslash doesn't really count,

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:55.690
it's going to come out
to exactly 38 bytes.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.390
Which means that this record in
the tcpdump data exactly represents

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.338
the transmission of the HTTP request
from our client, the example.net server.
