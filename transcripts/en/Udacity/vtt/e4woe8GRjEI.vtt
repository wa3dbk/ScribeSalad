00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.500
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, let me give you just a few more

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.710
examples, Michael, of a, how PCA and ICA differ. And I'm going to

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.760
do this mainly by talking about certain things that ICA does. And

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.660
this is really just for your edification, but I think it really

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.190
helps, to think about, those sort of underlying models and how

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.320
they differ, by thinking about how they react differently to different kinds

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.900
of data. So, just, here's a couple of examples. The one we

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.430
covered right away, was the blind source separation problem. And of course,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.950
what, what we recall is that ICA was, in

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.660
some sense, designed to solve the blind source separation

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.280
problem and in fact ICA does an excellent job

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.180
at solving the blind source separation problem. Meanwhile, PCA

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.310
does a terrible job at solving the blind source

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.780
separation problem and that's just because it's assuming this

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.600
kind of Gaussian distribution, it just does not recover

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.730
what's going on. But here's something that ICA does

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.250
differently from PCA. Is because it's got this kind of blind source root in it,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.100
it's actually directional. And what I mean by

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.320
that is, you recall I drew this sort

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.770
of matrix before, where we had features this

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.500
way. And we had samples of those features

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.640
like sound, time samples of sound this way.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.730
It turns out that for PCA, it doesn't

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.850
matter whether I give you this matrix or I give you

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.440
the transpose of this matrix. It ends up finding the same answer.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.500
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.890
&gt;&gt; And that should make sense, right?

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.030
Because it's just basically finding a new rotation

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.790
of the data, and these are effectively

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.070
just rotations of each other. For the purposes

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.790
of, of, if you just kind of think about it geometrically in space. ICA on the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.430
other hand, gives you completely different answers, if

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.150
you give it this versus giving it this.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.765
So ICA is highly directional. And PCA much less

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:48.440
so. But ICA, because it's making this kind of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.730
fundamental assumption, does end up generating some really cool

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.940
results. I'm going to give you another example of

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.830
one. That's like a blind source separation. In fact,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.410
I'm going to give you two. Okay? So, imagine

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.480
you had a bunch of inputs of faces. Okay?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.274
So, here's my input faces. I give you bunches and

00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:08.930
bunches and bunches of faces. What do you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.340
think PCA would do? What do you think the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.953
first principle component of PCA would be over

00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:17.520
pictures of thousands and thousands and thousands of faces.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.130
&gt;&gt; Over all darkness of the image.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.520
&gt;&gt; Actually that is exactly right. The first thing that

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.150
PCA tends to do with images, we are actual, we

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.210
are talking pictures, not just sketches here, is it finds

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.010
the direction of maximum variance and that tends to be

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.140
brightness or luminous. Which kind of makes sense because

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.190
that's typically the kind of thing that kids vary the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.170
most. So in fact, the first thing people often

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.930
do when they're trying to use PC on faces

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.940
is they normalize all of that away. Because the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.710
first principal component isn't terribly helpful. It's just kind of

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.450
giving you the average light. What do you think

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.760
the second thing it would find it would be?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.460
&gt;&gt; Hair versus not hair?

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.830
&gt;&gt; No. Interestingly enough. What it ends up finding is sort of the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.110
average face. Which is kind of like the question you asked me earlier

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.980
about what happens if you go through the origin.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.850
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.050
&gt;&gt; So, there's actually names for this. It's called the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.260
Eigen Faces because, you know, as I noted before, it's

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.540
an Eigen problem. And it basically finds kind of the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.950
average face. And that's kind of weird. But it works for reconstruction.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.360
I don't know what the average face here would look

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.560
like. Probably something like this. Yeah, so you can see

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.090
how useful that would be. Not even clear that's a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.590
face. But it works for reconstruction. Do you know what ICA

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.980
ends up finding?

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.370
&gt;&gt; Noses?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.230
&gt;&gt; Yes, it finds noses. It finds eye

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.359
selectors. It finds mouth selectors. It finds hair selectors.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.280
And, I think, intuitively the way I would think about

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.160
this is because PCA is doing this global orthogonality thing, it's

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.510
going to be forced to find global features. ICA I didn't

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.890
say was global, and that's because it's basically local, it doesn't

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.780
care about orthogonality. So it tends to find parts of.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.640
If you feed it the metrics the right way, it tends

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.330
to find parts of. And so it ends up finding these

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.680
little selectors. So this has a really nice outcome in cases

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.760
like natural images or natural scenes. So what do you think

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.590
happens Michael, if I take natural scenes, you know, pictures of the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.020
forest and grass and walking around. Just things that I would see

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.330
if I were just walking out in the world and taking bunches

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.250
of pictures. And I feed it into ICA. Well the answer

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.290
for PCA, by the way, is the same as before, is you

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.290
get brightness, you get sort of the average image, things that really

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.720
make sense if your goal is to do reconstruction. But ICA actually

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.450
gives you something different. What do you think the independent

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.330
components, the underlying causes, so to speak, of natural scenes are?

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.440
&gt;&gt; I'm still thinking about the face parts. But, by analogy, it seems like it

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.970
would be the, you know, things in the world like, trees, and rocks, and ground.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.520
&gt;&gt; Not quite, and that's I think in part because, there are too many of

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.895
those things that kind of overlap in

00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:50.070
too many different ways. It actually finds something

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.700
more fundamental.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.680
&gt;&gt; Edges.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.760
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. ICA finds edges. Now

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.600
for me, that is incredibly satisfying. It says that

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.520
the independent components of the world are edges. Now

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.650
there are two things that come out of this.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.120
One is just the satisfying feeling you get by

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.910
realizing that in it there's a algorithm that, on

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.780
it's own, recovers something fundamental like edges. That's very

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.500
nice. But the second thing that's nice about it

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.840
is, once I use ICA to do my

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.420
feature transformation and discover that what it's learning are

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.280
edge detectors, well then I can just write edge

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.370
detectors. I can just write algorithms that are very

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.660
fast, very efficient, that can go through images of

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.430
natural scenes and pull out the edges. It's unclear

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.160
how to do that with, you know, different principled

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.600
projections, but if edges are the fundamental building blocks

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.980
of natural scenes then there are people who know how to

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.370
write edge projectors very quickly. By the way, you get a

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.110
similar result, I won't talk about it, but you get a

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.020
similar result in our information retrieval

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.910
problem where you have documents. And

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.445
you can read this in the material we gave you. But

00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:58.500
what ICA ends up giving you for documents are topics. And

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.230
they're very easily interpreted that way. Collections of words that select

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.000
for specific topics that are themselves made up of collections of words

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.820
that select for topics and collections of uncorrelated words

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.560
that get rid of distracter documents. So the independent

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.060
components of scenes are edges and the independent components

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.230
of documents are topics. And that feels very nice, but

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.030
in both of these cases, both with edges and

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.680
with topics, it turns out that the form of these

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.080
topics are something that you can compute very, very

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.010
quickly. And sort of independently of the underlying ICA algorithm.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.520
So why does that matter, Michael? Well, remember what I

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.110
said originally about unsupervised learning and what it was good

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.860
for, was understanding your data. Doing kind of data analysis

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.340
from a human being's point of view. So what something

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.320
like ICA, and other algorithms we might imagine, do, is

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.960
they allow you to do analysis over your data, to

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.190
discover fundamental features of them, like edges, or topics or

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.130
noses and eyes. And then once you understand that's what's making

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.240
up your data, you can simply write code that will select for it, or figure

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.570
out what the important parts of your

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.670
data are correspondingly. And so here, we haven't

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.180
just done this feature transformation problem for

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.080
the sake of doing classification, feature transformation actually

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.000
helps us to understand the fundamental underlying

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.960
causes, or at least structure of our data.
