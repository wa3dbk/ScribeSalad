00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.351
The exponent should be a positive 8. Great thinking if you got it right. If you

00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:08.729
multiply 9 10ths times 10 to the 9th, we would get 900,000,000. And 9 followed

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.755
by eight 0s. In order to get this number back in scientific notation, our

00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:17.126
decimal point would have to be right after the 9. This means the power on the 10

00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:21.554
must be an 8. Our decimal point is here, and if we move it 8 places to the

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.100
right, sure enough, we get 900 million.
