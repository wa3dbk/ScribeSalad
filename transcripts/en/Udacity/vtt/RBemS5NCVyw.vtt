00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.854
We've seen that 3JS can't easily let us position and rotate the hand of a clock

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:09.542
in place. The problem is that 3Js rotates and then positions when we like to do

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:14.245
these in the opposite order. One simple solution that 3JS provides is to use

00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:19.414
Object 3D to make a new object that contains our clock hand. Here's the code for

00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:24.290
how to do this. What is happening here is that the block is nested inside the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.556
clock hand object. The translation moves the block so that one end is over the

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:32.725
center of the clock face so that the hand will rotate around the clock properly.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:36.755
By putting this object into the clock hand, I'm saying that I want to use the

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:41.898
block in its current position. I can then apply an additional scale, rotate and

00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:46.390
translate. In this case I just want to rotate. The final line of code adds the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.660
clockHand object to the scene. That's 1 way to look at Object3D. It adds more

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.862
transforms into the list that you can then use. We now have some six transforms

00:00:54.862 --> 00:00:58.560
that we can set in this system. Here's the conceptual diagram of the whole idea.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.058
We create a block and we can scale, rotate and translate that block. Then by

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:08.730
putting it inside an Object 3D called clockHand, we get an additional scale,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.983
rotate and translate that wen can apply. Here's a more compact way to write out

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:17.902
the order of transforms. The object at scale, rotated and translated and then

00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:22.866
scaled, rotated and translated again. This looks a bit crazy, I've put the order

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:26.724
of the transform from right to left. There is a reason for this and we'll talk

00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:30.648
about it when we get to matrices. For now just believe me that this is how most

00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:35.466
computer graphics text show a series of transforms. The way I remember this

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:40.458
order is by the word trash. There's TRS in that word in the proper notational

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:44.758
order. I guess I could use the word trees instead and not have to worry about

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:49.450
the h, but I like trash, as it reminds me of the TRS80. Called the TRASH 80 for

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.530
short, one of the first personal computers. From back when programs were stored

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.876
on cassette tapes, once upon a time, this computer ruled the earth. In 1979, it

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:03.458
had the largest selection of software for any PC. Trs then is the order to

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:08.471
remember. In our case, just the boxes translation and the clock hands rotation

00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:12.948
are used. This gets us the combination we want. Translates so there's a new

00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:17.231
origin and then rotate around this origin. Adding a whole Object 3D to get a

00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:22.195
single additional transform seems like overkill, but really it doesn't add much

00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:22.573
code.
