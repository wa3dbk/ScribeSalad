00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.202
Log in to your AWS account and
go to the EMR service.

00:00:04.202 --> 00:00:06.470
This is what I see all my past clusters.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.160
Can create a new one here.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.740
Here you see a quick set up for
clusters.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.185
There are two different
modes you can use.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:18.665
Either you can launch a long running
cluster or do step execution.

00:00:18.665 --> 00:00:22.185
Which runs all the jobs you add
then terminates the cluster.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.125
Here you can see various applications
you can install in the cluster.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.955
And this is where you select
the number of nodes and

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:31.115
what type of instances you'll use.

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:34.295
Before you get started launching
a cluster though let's consider how

00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:36.710
we're going to get data into and
out of our cluster.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.630
Since we won't be storing
data on this thing over time.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.410
Typically transferring data into and
out of EC2 instances costs money.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.720
But Amazon has a service called S3 for
storing data.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.830
Transfers between S3 and EC2 are free.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.370
So it makes a lot of sense
to keep your data on S3 then

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.790
transfer it to an EMR cluster for
analysis.
