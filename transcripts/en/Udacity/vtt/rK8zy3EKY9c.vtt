If you said four batches, way to go. I know for the first fourth cup of sugar,

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.296
I'll make one batch of brownies. For the next fourth cup of sugar, I'll make

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:10.922
another batch of brownies. Another fourth cup of sugar will give me another

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:14.727
batch of brownies, and my last fourth cup of sugar will give me another batch of

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.505
brownies. I started with one cup of sugar and I wanted to see how many times did

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:22.833
1/4 divide into one cup. I can turn division into multiplication by multiplying

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:26.796
by the reciprocal. So, 1 times 4 over 1. I get 1 times 4, which is 4, and 1

00:00:26.808 --> 00:00:31.063
times 1, which is 1. 4 divided by 1, makes 4. The key idea in all these problems

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:35.214
is that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of

00:00:35.226 --> 00:00:38.405
the fraction. We're going to use this idea in the next problem.
