00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.543
This first trinomial can be factored as x plus 4 times x plus 6. We want factors

00:00:05.543 --> 00:00:10.887
of positive 24 that sum to positive 10. The second trinomial can be factored

00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:15.428
into x plus 5 times x plus 4. We want factors of positive 20 that sum to

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:19.594
positive 9. Once we have our factored form, we cancel the factors that appear in

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:24.190
the numerator and the denominator so we're left with x plus 6. Divided by the

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.917
quantity, x plus 5. Great work if you've got this as your final rational

00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:29.763
expression.
