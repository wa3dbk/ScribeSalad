00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.738
Now we don't know who the faster or the slower person is. But we know the

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:08.615
slower person takes 12 hours, and the faster person takes only 6 hours. Great

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:13.794
algebra skills for getting that one correct. We'll start solving this equation

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:17.988
by multiplying through by the lowest common denominator. Which is 4x times x

00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:23.898
minus 6, the product of these denominators. If we multiply through by the LCD,

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:27.558
we'll find that he x cancels in the first term, the x minus 6 cancels in the

00:00:27.558 --> 00:00:33.155
second term. And then, on the right hand side of the equation, the 4s' simplify

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:39.011
to 1. This leaves us with 4 times x minus 6, here. 4x for a second term and an

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:44.628
x times x minus 6 on the right hand side. Next, we'll distribute this positive

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:49.504
4 and this x to get our next equation. We'll combine the 4x on the left and the

00:00:49.504 --> 00:00:54.945
right, to get 8x minus 24 equals x squared minus 6x. Now we're almost to a

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:59.310
quadratic expression that we can factor. We just need to subtract 8x and add 24

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.272
to both sides of the equation. This gives us 0 on the left side, x squared

00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:11.535
minus 14x, plus 24 on the right side. Now we want to find factors of positive

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:17.820
24 that sum to negative 14. Those factors are negative 2, and negative 12. We

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.400
set each of these factors equal to 0, and then we solve for x. So, we find the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.619
values of x equals 2 or x equals 12. And this might be confusing. Which answer

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.953
should we take? Before we've always had at least one of the answers be

00:01:31.953 --> 00:01:37.047
negative. So we could eliminate it since a negative time didn't make sense. The

00:01:37.047 --> 00:01:41.360
key is that one person is 6 hours slower than the other. So if someone was 6

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.328
hours slower than someone who could work 2 hours, we'd wind up with a negative

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:50.544
time. So this one would be out. This means that the slower person must take 12

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.500
hours, and the faster person could do it in 6.
