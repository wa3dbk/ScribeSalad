00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.960
Hey, so, one particular thing we need to
be concerned about is all the tracking

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.590
that happens when we visit websites,
they know where we're going.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.388
So if you go to a website of course,

00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:16.422
they will know that you're accessing
that website, but what about others?

00:00:16.422 --> 00:00:20.806
So you'll be surprised how many other
websites are able to figure out that you

00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:23.670
withered for
example www.NewYorkTimes.com.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.880
These are tens of them,
I think at one point I read

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.800
50 other sites learn about the fact that
you are visiting www.NewYorkTimes.com.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.790
These third parties are able to
do it because they're either

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.480
advertisements embedded in the New
York Times phase that you get back, or

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.080
they're the likes, the Facebook,
Twitter, and whatever other things.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.030
And some of these things
we may not even see or

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.060
pay attention to, but
essentially, we pull some

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.370
bit of the content that makes up the
page from all these websites that allow

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.270
them to track the fact that we
are visiting New York Times.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.330
So you can do what is called
third party cookie blocking.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.247
So browsers actually, they allow
you to do a variety of things.

00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:02.300
You can block cookies.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.790
If you block cookies altogether,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.610
then maybe you can't do anything useful
with the NewYorkTimes.com either, but

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.660
third party cookies blocking,
of course, protects you.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.610
Blocking third party cookies of course,
protects you.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.960
You can tell your browser that
you don't like to be tracked, and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.380
in this case, the browser when it
sends some information to a website

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.610
would actually tell the website that
the user doesn't want to be tracked.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.570
Whether the website honors that or
not is a different question.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.093
Cookies are kept on your computer
to track your history and so on.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:37.560
We can clear those and when the next
time you visit the website,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.910
the website won't have this knowledge
of what you had done previously.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.780
You can block pop-ups.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.590
You can, there are other private
browsing sort of things that you can do,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.710
browser modes that and
clear out any state that may be

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.110
built while you're using
a tab incognito mode or

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.420
even more sort of aggressive privacy
things that you can do to browsers.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.830
So the idea is that
tracking is progressive.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.860
There's some things we can do about it.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.510
We don't know how effective those things
are but at least there are things that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.750
you can do by going into your privacy
setting of your browser that you use.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.880
And they're slightly different
across different browsers.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.330
So So I'm not talking a great
deal about how exactly you do,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.260
but I would highly encourage
you to explore these.
