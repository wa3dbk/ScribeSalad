00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.070
And at last, we have the final diagram summarizing everything that we have done.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.800
This example is just meant to illustrate what real problem solving is like.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.300
In real model building, we make choices that we think will lead to new insights,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.410
which then reveal new paths of analysis,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.970
which build upon previous knowledge to gradually arrive at the model.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.186
Very soon, we'll work together through a complete example from the ground up to

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:28.000
see the iterative cycles of question, model and validate built upon each other.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.430
You'll see how to turn a vague question into a rigorous problem of

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.400
statistical inference through successive refinement.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.360
You'll learn to identify possible next iterations and

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.840
how to use them to generate possible paths of analysis.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.180
By the end of this lesson, you will feel confident in your ability to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.150
tackle new difficult problems and start making progress with them.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.260
The choices we make during each phase can be diagrammed in

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.930
a tree like the one here.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.570
It's a useful tool for considering our possible paths forward during analysis,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.260
as well as revealing options for revisiting steps when you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.250
must inevitably adjust decisions made during earlier phases.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.450
In the rest of this lesson, we will apply each of these steps to an actual data

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.820
set and you will get a chance to follow along and practice these steps with us.
