00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When you divide 4 by 36, you get 0.111, or in percent, 11.1%.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That's the mortality rate of sick people in the hospital.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's 0 for the healthy people.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The mortality rate at home is 50%--half of them pass away--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and 0.25% approximately for healthy people.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now, if we look at this, we realize that you are likely sick.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If you fall into the sick category,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
your chances of dying at home are 50% and it's just about 11% in the hospital.

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, you should really go to the hospital very quickly
