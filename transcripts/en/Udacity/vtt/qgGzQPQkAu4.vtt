00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.880
Now that we've seen what
an orthographic camera can do for

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.130
us, let's see how to create,
manipulate, and apply one.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.790
In this demo, we've got a game world
with a huge star, a tiny planet, and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.670
an itty bitty satellite.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.580
Let's see what this looks like,
without using a camera.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.740
Using the default camera, we can just
barely see the edge of the star.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.520
We can see just half the planet.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.920
And we can't even see the satellite.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.620
It's actually right here, but it's so
small, it's not even one pixel wide.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.070
So, let's use an orthographic camera
to zoom in on each one of these

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.630
objects in turn.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.550
So, what is a camera?

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.820
Well, camera holds on to two matrices.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.870
One matrix encodes the camera's position
and orientation in the game world.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.561
For 2D games, this is usually kist a
simple x, y pair, but for 3D games, say,

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:49.920
a 3D flight simulator, the camera can
hold the plane's 3D position, its pitch,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.950
its roll, and its yaw.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.990
The other matrix encodes how the camera
translates positions in the world

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.840
into positions on the screen.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.900
This includes how much
perspective to include,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.400
that's fisheye lens
versus telephoto lens.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.690
And how big an area on the screen
the camera will ultimately draw to.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.440
To use a camera, we first need
to declare and initialize it.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.640
Then there are two things we have
to do down in the render callback.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.280
The first is calling camera.update.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.160
Whenever we adjust the properties of
a camera, like its position, it needs to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.470
fold those changes into the matrices
that define how it looks at the world.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.520
The easy way to ensure this happens
is just to call update each frame.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.200
It's a fast operation, so no worries.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.285
The second thing we need to
do is tell our shape renderer

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:34.625
that we want to use our camera.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:37.555
We do this by setting the shape
renderer's projection matrix to

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.775
the camera's combined matrix.

00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:42.995
The combined matrix is the culmination
of the camera's view and

00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:43.721
projection matrices.

00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:47.202
Yeah, there's a lot of
matrices flying around.

00:01:47.202 --> 00:01:50.542
Basically, shapeRenderer doesn't have a
notion of position in some larger world,

00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:53.192
so all it's got is a projection matrix.

00:01:53.192 --> 00:01:56.882
One more thing is we need to
handle screen resizing correctly.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.822
The resize callback gets
called right after create and

00:01:59.822 --> 00:02:01.860
any time the screen size changes.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.620
Which could be because
a mobile device rotated, or

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.160
because we're running
the desktop app and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.620
the user is changing the window
size by dragging around the corner.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.490
When the screen size changes, we need
to make sure our camera is updated.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.465
If the camera thinks that the screen
is smaller than it really is,

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:20.450
shapes will be way bigger than we
want them to be, and vice versa.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.230
This call setToOrtho updates
the camera with the new screen size.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.780
The first argument is whether
an increase in value of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.880
y should mean going down the screen and
we don't want that to be true.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.130
All right,
let's see what code it'll take

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.140
in order to get the camera to zoom
in on each of these objects in turn.
