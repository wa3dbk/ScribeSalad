00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.380
Now let's do a quiz with
the 2-way set-associative cache.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.730
Let's say we have a cache
with 32 byte block size,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.410
and four sets with two blocks each.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.190
So that's why it's 2-way
set-associative, every set has two ways.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.330
If the processor does these
accesses in this order,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.480
what is the final content of this cache?
