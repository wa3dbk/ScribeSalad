When it comes to forming intimate relationships: about 90% of US adults get

00:00:04.126 --> 00:00:09.494
married at some point in their life, and about 85% have children. The age at

00:00:09.494 --> 00:00:13.264
which people get married changes from generation to generation, as we can see

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:21.050
here. In the 1890s, the median age for the first marriage for men was about 26.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.305
And for women, it was about 22. The age of first marriage were really low in

00:00:26.305 --> 00:00:31.521
the 1950s. And now they're at an all time high, with men marrying around age

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.973
27, and women marrying around age 25.
