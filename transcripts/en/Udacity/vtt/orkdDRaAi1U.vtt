But, uh-oh, it looks like we have a problem. We did fill in our table

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.938
completely, but one of these answers for the volume of a box doesn't make sense.

00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:11.795
Can you tell me which answer is the one that has an issue? Keep in mind what

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:15.827
volume is in the real world, and then how the quantities that it's allowed to

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:18.207
equal will impact your decision over here.
