00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
Now that we have four possible states for our two bit predictor there is

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.096
an interesting question of does it matter in which state we start the predictor

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:12.085
off. So with the one bit predictor we had to start it in either zero or

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:16.460
one state. If we start it in the not taken state, zero, that means that if

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.068
the branch is not taken it will start predicting correctly right off the bat.

00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:25.770
Is we start predicting zero but the branches actually mostly taken we will have

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.613
a single mis-prediction before we start doing taken. For a two bit predictor,

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:34.640
however, the question is really should we start in one of the strong

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.108
conviction states or should we start in one of the weak prediction states.

00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:44.020
If we start in a strong state, for example zero, zero, and

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.032
the actual decisions are not taken, then we will stay in that

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:54.580
same strong state and never have any missed predictions. However,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.735
if we start in the strong state zero, zero, but the branch tends to be taken.

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:04.836
We will mispredict once, move to the zero one, the weak not taken state.

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:10.232
Missed predict again and then start predicting correctly. If we start in

00:01:10.232 --> 00:01:14.324
a strong state and it's the correct strong state we have no missed predictions,

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:17.590
if it's the wrong strong state we have two missed predictions.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.949
If however we start in a weak state such as zero one. And

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:26.750
we started in the correct weak state. We will just move to the strong state and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.506
still have all correct predictions. So, in the case when we

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:35.197
guessed right what should be the dominant behavior in the starting state,

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:39.814
we have perfect prediction regardless of whether we start in the strong or

00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:45.171
weak state. However, If we were wrong about where to start and

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:50.885
we start in, let's say, zero, one, but now the branch is mostly taken,

00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:55.876
we will have one missed prediction here and now we will be moving to

00:01:55.876 --> 00:02:01.464
the weak taken state and start having correct predictions from then on.

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:05.972
So if we start in a weak state, we don't lose anything if we were right. But

00:02:05.972 --> 00:02:12.070
we gain one less misprediction, if we were wrong about what should be the bias.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.950
So this argument means that probably, we should be starting in the weak state.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.030
Pick one, doesn't really matter. However, there is a flip side to it.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.542
Let's say that the branch is taken, not taken, taken, not taken. And

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:32.863
we start in the strong state. The branch is taken so we move to the weak state.

00:02:32.863 --> 00:02:37.220
Then it's not taken so we move back to the strong state. And so on,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.357
we missed predict here, but we correctly predicted here and here, so

00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:47.863
half the time we have missed predictions. If we started in the one, one state,

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:52.963
we would have a similar behavior, we would mis-predict every other time, but

00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:57.245
if we start in the wrong weak state and have the same behavior here.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:01.940
If the branch is taken and we have a weak not taken. We mis-predict and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.807
we move to the weak taken state. Now the branch is not taken so

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:10.317
we mis-predict again. And move back to the weak not taken state. Branch is

00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:14.842
taken again and so we mis-predict again. And we keep mis-predicting like this.

00:03:14.842 --> 00:03:21.230
So as far as worse case behavior on alternating branch decisions is concerned.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.790
Starting in a weak state, around some more risk of having this worst case

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.370
behavior of always missed predicting. Fortunately, this is much more

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.447
common behavior than this. So probably it's a good idea to start in a weak

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:40.225
taken state because taken branches are slightly more common than not taken. But

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:44.031
in reality, as you can see, it doesn't really matter much because if

00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:47.515
the branch is mostly taken, one missed prediction initially is

00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:51.451
not really going to be very costly to us because from then on it's going to

00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:55.523
behave the same way regardless of what we started off with. So in reality,

00:03:55.523 --> 00:03:59.348
although it seems like it's a good idea to start in the weak taken state.

00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:03.548
In practice the overall accuracy of the branch predictor is

00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:08.408
effected very little by what exactly do we start of in. So we might a well just

00:04:08.408 --> 00:04:12.060
start of in zero zero state because that the easiest state to initialize into.
