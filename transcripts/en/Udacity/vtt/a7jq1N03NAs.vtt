00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.760
There's really not much you need to do to get

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.740
your application to use Memcache to save and get entity data,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.640
if you're using Objectify. But it's still useful to know

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.540
how to write code to use Memcache. So we're going to use

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.149
Memcache to save and get announcements, about conferences that are

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.610
nearly sold out. You can imagine, for example, that your web

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.970
app might display a banner ad to encourage people to

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.570
sign up. For conferences that are nearly sold out. There might

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.620
be other things you want to announce on your website, too.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.720
Maybe if you get a special speaker for a particular conference.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.160
Or you want to announce a special promotion. But for the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.080
sake of simplicity, we're just going to create announcements that conferences

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.790
are nearly sold out. Because the goal here is to learn

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.590
how to use Memcache. Announcements though, are a good example of

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.550
the kind of thing that you might want to save in

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.580
Memcache, without saving them to the Datastore. If the announcement gets evicted

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.620
from Memcache, there's no loss of real data, and it

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.480
doesn't really matter. No business transactions are affected, no one loses

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.380
their place at a conference. And the next announcement will likely

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.129
come along very soon anyway. Announcements are very transient, and don't

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.100
need to be saved for the long term and they

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.790
don't need to be backed up. So, they're perfect candidates to

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.810
be saved in Memcache, and only in Memcache. They don't need

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.050
to into the Datastore, that way you get all your announcements

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.800
without using any quota. So, you're going to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.640
adding the announcement class to your project. It's

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.430
a very simple class, we need it because

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.250
n point functions can't return string objects. So

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.080
they're going to put the text for the announcement,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.840
in the message field. Note that this class

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.930
is not annotated as our entity. We don't

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.060
want to save the announcements in the data store.
