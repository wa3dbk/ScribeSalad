00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.104
I've found that with pseudocode it helps to have a couple examples. So let's

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:10.714
look at this example. So we'll start with n is ten and then while n is greater

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:19.479
than one, we'll print it and if n is even we'll say that n is n over two.

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:25.688
Otherwise we'll say that n is 3 times n plus 1. What does this pseudocode

00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:28.312
print? Put your answer here.
