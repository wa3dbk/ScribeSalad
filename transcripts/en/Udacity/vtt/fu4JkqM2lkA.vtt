00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.658
The solution is to add the location to the x and y-coordinates being generated.

00:00:04.658 --> 00:00:09.004
Doing so moves all the vertices by this amount. Since all the vertices are

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:13.493
generated relative to the origin, this essentially moves the origin to this new

00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:14.183
location.
