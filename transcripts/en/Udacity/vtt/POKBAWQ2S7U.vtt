00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.380
Before we move on from this example, let's calculate a confidence interval for

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.972
the mean population difference. This is exactly the same as what you've learned

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:13.677
before except this time we use the mean difference. I won't go through it step

00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:16.929
by step this time. Try and figure it out on your own.
