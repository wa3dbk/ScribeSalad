00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.918
Cleaning, checking and counting OCD are the most common types of OCD and it

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:09.092
interferes with normal functioning of daily life. For example, a person with

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:12.813
OCD who fears germs is going to spend an excessive amount of time worrying

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:17.152
about germs. They're going to be thinking about all the germs that surround

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:21.682
them. Worrying about touching something and acquiring new germs. Now these

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:25.246
anxious thoughts that they have are combated by the compulsive behaviors that

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:30.312
they engage in. For example, a person who's afraid of germs may wash their

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:35.408
hands two to 300 times a day in scolding hot water. Or perhaps they wash them

00:00:35.408 --> 00:00:41.441
five to six times a day, but for 30 to 40 minutes at a time. The person is

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:46.021
aware of these compulsions but they're unable to stop them. A person with

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.336
checking OCD, may have to check the stove repeatedly before leaving the house

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:55.066
to make sure it's off even though they haven't cooked at home in months. And

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.972
finally a person with counting OCD maybe has to touch a doorknob 14 times for

00:00:58.972 --> 00:01:04.510
fear that his dog will die if he doesn't. Even though he knows there's really

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.646
no connection between how many times he touches a door knob and the fate of his

00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:12.118
dog. So the main thing to remember is that the person is aware of these

00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:15.150
compulsions, but they're still unable to stop them.
