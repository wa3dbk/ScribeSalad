You might have taken some different approaches to find the least common

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:07.850
denominator. Here is one way, we could have used the least common multiple. By

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:11.809
listing the multiples of 7 and by listing the multiples of 8, we can see that

00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:15.982
the lowest common number that they go into is 56. But this is a lot of work, and

00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:19.795
I don't want to have to do this every single time. So, let's try using our

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:23.551
factor tree. The only common factor of 8 and 7 is 1 and the numbers on the

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:28.618
outside must be 8 and 7, since 8 times 1 is 8 and 7 times 1 is 7. If we multiply

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.869
these factors together, we get 56. Well done if you got 56.
