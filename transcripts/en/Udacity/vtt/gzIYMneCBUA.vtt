00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the answer for the µ‘ is 70,000 of this given salary increase and the new σ stays the same.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We already talked about this example earlier in class, but now it's in the content

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of normal distribution so let me take a second to show this to you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In our normal, ignoring normalization constant,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we know that everyone's salary is drawn from a distribution that looks like this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is plugging in the mean and the variance as that defined it,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and now we know, we set the new salary x' to be the old salary plus 10,000

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That is the same as saying that the old salary was the new salary minus 10,000.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We now substitute this x over here with this expression over here--what we got is something

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that looks looks smallest, so you can see I took out the x and replaced it by x' minus 10,000

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and if you look at this carefully, you'll find this is the same as (x'-70,000)²/10,000².

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So that proves to you that the variance of the same deviation doesn't change

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and the mean has effect it by just increasing it to 70,000 but definitely

00:01:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the µ‘ is now 70,000 and the σ' remains 10,000.
