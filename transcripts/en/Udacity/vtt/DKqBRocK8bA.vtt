00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:07.239
Segues are used to transition from
one view controller to another in

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.710
the story board.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.660
There are many types, for now we're
going to use the show segue to display

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
a new view controller and its view on
top of the existing view controller.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.040
We've got a couple more steps
until Pitch Perfect is ready for

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.170
the app store.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.230
We have to set up the playback view,
and for

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.420
that I'm going to show you an amazing
new tool called stack views,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.460
that will make your life with other
layout constraints a lot easier.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.190
In addition, we have to actually record
the audio in the first view controller,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.630
and pass that along to the second one.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.110
Luckily, in iOS, that's but

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.550
a few lines of code to use with
the segue you just created.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.710
It may seem like a lot of steps, but so

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.610
far, you've created the foundation
of your first iOS app.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.200
You built the beginning of two screens,
and you're ready to

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.130
add in audio with the help of another
iOS framework called AV Foundation.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.453
Take a breather, and when you're ready
I'll be there in the next section.
