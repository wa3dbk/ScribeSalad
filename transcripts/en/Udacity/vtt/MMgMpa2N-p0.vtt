00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.140
We have our settings screen,
but no settings.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.510
In the next several sections, you're going
to be adding our two settings.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.400
I'll walk you through how we add
our first setting for location,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.780
then you'll do the temperature setting
on your own, so listen closely.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.268
First, we design a Preference XML file.

00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:19.010
The root element should be
a PreferenceScreen.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.560
In this example,
we have a CheckBoxPreference

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.860
and a ListPreference inside of it.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.090
In order to add
the Preferences XML file to our app,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.570
we first need to create an XML folder
under the resources res directory.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.360
Right-click on the res folder,
go to New / Android resource directory,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.530
and then type in xml
as the name of the directory.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.575
For resource type you can use xml
and then hit OK.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.510
Inside this folder, we right-click
to create a new XML Resource File.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.720
We call it pref_general,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.990
and the Root element is a PreferenceScreen
as we saw on the developer's site.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.020
And then our Preferences file is created.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.980
Then, add the location preference.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.730
Since the wireframes showed
an editable text field

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.318
to input user location as a string,
we make this an EditTextPreference.

00:01:07.368 --> 00:01:10.620
If you want to learn more about all
the possible XML attributes,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.370
you can Google for EditTextPreference.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.760
First, we specify a title
for the preference,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.060
which will be the label
that's displayed to the user.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.040
Then, we specify a key.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.690
And this key is actually
the Key Value in SharedPreferences.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.010
Going back to the code, we also add these
attributes to describe the Edit Text field

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.140
in the pop up dialog that was shown
in the wire frames.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.603
Going back to the code,
we can also configure properties

00:01:36.603 --> 00:01:38.226
of the Edit Text field.

00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:42.780
We specify the input type to be text,
and we cap it to a single line of text.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.790
It's bad practice to hard code
these strings here,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.250
so we declare them as constants
in the strings.xml file.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.970
These are the strings we declared.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.520
This is the name of the label
of the preference.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.290
It's user-visible, so we add a char limit
for translation purposes.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.840
You also specify location, which is
the name of the key in Shared Preferences.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.360
We don't want to translate it because
we always want to find the key

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.060
based on this name.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.169
We also specify a constant
for the default location.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.710
We also don't translate this
because we need to send it

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.750
to the server API like this.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.950
When you're done with these steps,
check them off and continue.
