00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.520
So we will see now that, another benefit of loop unrolling it that is allows us

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.440
also to reduce the CPI in addition, to reducing the number of instructions.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.120
To get some idea for how the CPI changes, we need to have a processor. So let's

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.370
assume we have a, 4-issue in-order processor, meaning it's only able to look at

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.520
the next four instructions to see what can be executed together. Meaning it can

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.740
only look at the next four instructions, to see what it can execute together.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.180
And let's assume that the processor has perfect branch prediction. So first,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.930
let's look at what happens when we try to execute the original loop.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.780
So to see what happens with this loop in this processor, let's look cycle by

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.360
cycle at which instructions can execute. In the very first cycle,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.690
we will try to do this load and then we will try to see whether we can execute

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.330
the next instruction in order in the same cycle, but we cannot because it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.550
depends on the load. So, this instruction has to be done here. Now, we will look

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.700
at the next instruction, and try to execute it in order in the same cycle, but

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.170
we cannot because it depends on R2 again, so we move here. The next instruction,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.670
however, does not depend on the previous one, so we can do this add here. But

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.630
then, for the branch, it does depend on R1 so it can be only done here.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.020
Because we have perfect branch prediction, this load has also been fetched from

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.780
the next iteration and it doesn't depend on the branch that was done here so

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.800
we will actually do the load for the next iteration. And then, we will,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.780
again, not be able to do the add. So the add happens in the next cycle. And

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.140
then, in this cycle, these two happen and so on. So overall, after this initial

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.160
load that had to be done by itself just because, there was no branch before it,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.000
it takes us three cycles to do all five of the instructions in the loop.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.760
So the CPI here, is 3 cycles for 5 instructions. But

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.070
remember that, we can do scheduling of this loop to try to improve the CPI. So

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.580
before we get into what's the CPI of the unrolled loop,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.130
let's see what the CPI is if we schedule this loop body.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.050
Our scheduling will start out with this loop body, and then try to maximize

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.260
the CPI that we can get, by reordering the instructions. So, clearly,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.090
here, this load could, not be done in parallel with the next instruction,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.260
because there is a dependence there. So we need to find something, and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.730
it cannot be the branch, because it needs to stay at the end of the iteration.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.100
That we can put here, and that this ADDI can move there.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.860
So our scheduling algorithm will move the ADDI here. So

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.300
now that we are subtracting 4 from R1 here, we need to adjust the store so that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.060
it adds back the 4 that we decremented here. Because, this store was supposed to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.810
store to the same element as the load. Now, however, we have moved R1, so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.720
to access the same element as the load, we need to add 4 here. Note that

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.320
moving the ADDI it really the only scheduling freedom we have here because.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.390
We need to do the load, and the ADD, and the store in that order so

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.840
they cannot be re-ordered, the branch needs to stay at the end of the loop, so

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.790
pretty much the only freedom we have is where is the ADDI going to happen.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.920
So now let's look at what happens cycle-by-cycle. We can do the load in

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.130
the first cycle. The ADDI can be done, together with the load. But

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.200
the ADD to what we loaded still has to be done in the next cycle. The store

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.110
cannot be done until this ADD is complete. The branch can still proceed

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.750
in parallel with the store. And now, because of perfect branch prediction,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.680
we're going to move here, and we can try to do the load for the next iteration.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.950
Note that R1 has been updated here in the previous iteration, so all the way

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.960
through here we really did not modify R1, so pretty much the store of the branch

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.520
didn't modify R1. That's the only registered dependence that this load has, so

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.970
the load can be done here. And then we can also do the R1 update here,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.480
because this ADDI only depends on R1, and the R1 has been updated here.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.690
So we can do this. So as you can see, now it takes two cycles,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.250
to do these five instructions. So the CPI we get is now 2 over 5.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.750
It took us two cycles to do the five instructions. This is significantly better,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.440
than without scheduling so, scheduling did help
