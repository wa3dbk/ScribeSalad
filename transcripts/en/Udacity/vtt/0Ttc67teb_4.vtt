00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.620
Thus far, we've seen how to design and implement

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.580
scalable algorithms that go into the guts of an

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.750
operating system for a parallel machine. Now it is

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.820
time to look at a case study of an operating

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.740
system that has been built for a shared memory

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.740
multiprocessor. This operating system is called Tornado. And the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.560
purpose of this case study is to understand the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.210
principles that go into the structuring of an operating system

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.870
for a shared memory multi-processor. Thus far,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.010
we have covered a lot of ground on

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.630
parallel systems. And as a reminder, I want

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.750
to tell you that you should be reading

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.010
and understanding the papers by Merigram and Scard

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.240
on synchronization. Anderson and others on communication issues

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.190
in parallel systems, Skilante and others on scheduling

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.330
federal loans, scheduling. To get the full benefit

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.230
of all the lectures you've seen already, you definitely should

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.020
read and understand all those papers. And all these papers

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.490
are listed in the reading list for the course anyhow.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.590
And what we're going to do now is look at how some

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.730
of the techniques that we've discussed thus far gets into

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.950
a parallel operating system. So, I'm going to look at one

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.070
or two examples of parallel operating system case studies, so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.680
that we can understand these issues somewhat in in more detail.
