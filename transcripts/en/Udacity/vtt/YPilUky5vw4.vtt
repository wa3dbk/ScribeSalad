Every time x increases by 1, f of x is multiplied by 1 3rd. We can see this in

00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:12.342
the points that I labeled here for you. As x steps up by ones, f of x is going

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:19.890
from 9 to 3 to 1 to 1 3rd and so on. This is definitely different. Pretty cool.
