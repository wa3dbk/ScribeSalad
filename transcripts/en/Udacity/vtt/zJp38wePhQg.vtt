00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.220
Frameworks are incredibly powerful.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.860
And an invaluable resource
when developing complex

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.970
interactive single page applications.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.250
With all of the stuff that frameworks do
for us, I don't want you to forget that

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.690
these frameworks are primarily
made up of regular JavaScript.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.960
In the next lesson, we'll be taking
a deep dive into the Backbone framework,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.240
to see how it maintains features
like templating, event handling, and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.870
state management.
