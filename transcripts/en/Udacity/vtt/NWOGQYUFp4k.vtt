00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We now come to the hypothesis test unit number 2 and we just put together

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
what we've learned in the previous hypothesis test unit and in the unit on confidence intervals.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This ends up to be the dominant way of doing hypothesis testing.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We arrive at a very simple formula that we can even program.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
According to Wikipedia in the 2007-2008 season,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the average NBA basketball player was 6 feet and 6.98 inches tall.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That is the same as 200.66 cm or for the sake of this exercise, just 200 cm.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let me question this and see if this is actually acceptable.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Go to a training game for NBA players.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Here they are training, and I drag all of the players in the side and I take their height.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
As I take those measurements, I find, here the sizes I've observed.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In fact, I got everything from 199 cm to 206 in 1 cm increment.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And now, I want to ask the two-sided hypothesis test question

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
whether I shall reject the claim that the average player

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in the NBA is 200 cm at a 95% confidence level. The trick goes as follows.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You learned about confidence intervals, which is the mean plus/minus a factor taken from the T-table

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
times a square root of the empirical variance over N.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That formula you've not seen many times in practice.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000
When I plug this in here with the appropriate (a), I get for the mean 202.5 ± 1.916.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If you want to check this, I'm using 2.365 for (a).

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Graphically, what this means is if here is the 200 and here are my data points,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the mean measurement of the sample sits over here and the 95% confidence level stops at 200.58,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
just short of 200, and that means we reject the hypothesis of 200 cm

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
based on our sample of 8 people, because the confidence interval doesn't quite make it here.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, I should argue that this isn't quite correct in practice depending on what town I go to,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I might find a different sample and a different town.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We say we didn't pick these people completely independently and it isn't accounted here.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That's just a word of caution, but I think you get the principle. It's really simple.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Use your confidence interval and check whether the outcome

00:02:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
lies within or outside the confidence interval.
