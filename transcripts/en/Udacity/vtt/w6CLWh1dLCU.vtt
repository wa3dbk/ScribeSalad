00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.700
As Dean described, we should let the data speak

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.720
to determine variables of interest. There's a tool that we

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.630
can use to create a number of scatter plots automatically.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.376
It's called a scatter plot matrix. In a scatter plot

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:14.928
matrix. There's a grid of scatter plots between every

00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:18.730
pair of variables. As we've seen, scatter plots are great,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.590
but not necessarily suited for all types of variables. For

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.430
example, categorical ones. So there are other types of visualizations

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.350
that can be created instead of scatter plots. Like box plots

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.400
or histograms when the variables are categorical. Let's produce the scatter plot

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.310
matrix for our pseudo Facebook data set. We're going to use the

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.890
GGally package to do so. So make sure you've installed it and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.630
then go ahead and load it using the library command. Now,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.840
I'm also going to set the theme here too. Now, there's two other

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.520
things that we want to do. First we want to set the seed

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.500
so we get reproducible results. Now, you might be wondering why we

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.770
set the seed in the first place. And it's because

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.860
we're going to sample from our data set. Our data set contains

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.730
all these variables and I actually don't want all the variables.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.750
I don't want user ID, year joined, or year joined.bucket. So

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.910
what I can do is subset my data frame and then

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.900
sample from that sub set. If I check out the variables

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.230
in my subset data frame these are the ones of interest.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.550
Now I didn't use year joined or year joined.bucket, because this

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.410
one's a categorical variable and really these were derived from tenure. Now

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.170
I'm ready to use the GG pairs function inside of GGally to

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.860
create this scatter plot matrix. Now, I've already run this piece of

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.250
code and I do want to warn you that it takes a long

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.300
time for this to generate. It might even take over an hour.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.540
Feel free to run the command and if its taking a long

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.070
time for your plot to generate just come back to your computer

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.560
at another time. We've also included a pdf of the scatter plot in

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.565
the instructor notes so you can check that out as well. Here's

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:46.450
our scatter plot matrix, and notice in the upper part of the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.160
matrix we can see the correlation coefficients for the pairs of variables.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.900
For age and date of birth year, the correlation is actually negative

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.040
one. And we can see that on the scatter plot. Sometimes we

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.250
may want to produce these types of matrices so that way we can

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.930
produce one number summaries of the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.090
different relationships of our variables. This

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.260
is just like the correlation work that we did in lesson four.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.389
So, I've described the plots above the diagonal for the scatter plot matrix, but

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.220
what do you notice in the lower left of the scatter plot matrix? Write

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.460
a few sentences about what you see in this next quiz. And pay careful

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.130
attention to the variable of gender. What types of plots do you think these are?
