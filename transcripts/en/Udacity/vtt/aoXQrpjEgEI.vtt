00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.934
First we distribute the positive 2 to negative 1 and negative y. So I get

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:09.976
negative 2 minus 2y plus 5y equals 7. Next I combine the like terms to get

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:15.255
positive 3y. We can add 2 to both sides to get 3y equals 9 and then divide both

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.688
sides by 3 to get y equals 3. Way to go if you got 3.
