00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.850
Out of four choices,
which one did you pick, David?

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; So, I picked the first one, but

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.162
I think there's actually
two correct answers.

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:07.060
What we're looking for

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.050
is something else in S1 that has
a negation in another sentence.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.040
Not has wings has a negation in S2,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.750
so we could resolve on S2 with
the not has wings portion of S1.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.460
Has fur also has a negation in S3.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.560
So we could also resolve on S3 and
the has fur portion of S1.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.100
&gt;&gt; This is right, David.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.290
At the end of this, we're left with
null, which is a contradiction.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.390
Therefore, an assumption
that is not bird is false.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.720
Therefore, it must be a bird and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.920
the robot has just proved
that this must be a bird.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.580
Note what we have done.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.810
We have mechanized parts of logic.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.430
And sort of coming up
with large truth tables.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.110
And it's sort of coming up with
complex chains of inference

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.830
based on modus ponens and modus tollens.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.484
We have found in our garden
resolutions are improving,

00:00:56.484 --> 00:01:01.110
which is a efficient way of proving
sentences and the truth values.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.290
This is how it works.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.209
Take all the sentence and

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.990
the knowledge base,
convert them into conjecture novel form.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.670
Take what you want to prove and
its negation.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.470
Put that as a new sentence.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.220
Now, starting with this particular
sentence, a new sentence.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.290
Find the literal in another sentence
on which you can resolve, and

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.160
keep on doing it until you find a null
condition, which is a contradiction.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.310
If you don't find a null condition,
if you don't find a contradiction,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.910
that means that what you
started with cannot be proved.
