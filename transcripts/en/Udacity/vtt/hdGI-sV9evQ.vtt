00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.918
Now I'd like to take a minute to characterize components.

00:00:02.918 --> 00:00:04.650
They are pre-existing and

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.460
general, making them reusable in a variety of contexts.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.030
The question arises, what does it mean to manufacture a component.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.910
Well to manufacture a component you just have to copy it.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.340
So the manufacturing costs are quite low.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.629
You can configure a component with respect to your needs and target environment.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.670
That is, there's a great deal of flexibility involved when you have components.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.210
The components that property built can be easily composed with each other and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.550
with noncomponent code.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.610
Components conform to a software component model that prescribes their

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.430
syntax and semantics, and how they are composed.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.280
We will look into example software component models a little later.
