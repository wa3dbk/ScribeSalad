This car shows two excellent examples of door design. So, black,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.670
so you can see that this is the handle and a

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.690
space, you can insert the hand. So it makes it obvious.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.540
You put your hand in here and you pull. Now, over here,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.860
a vertical door handle. Again, nicely done. Space,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.530
makes it obvious. The hand can fit. Vertical

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.260
slot. Put my hand in an pull. One

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.479
car, two different door handles. Both well designed.
