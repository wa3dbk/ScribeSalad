Let's quadruple check that you fully understand the connection between Grant's

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.079
situation that we're talking about, the graph that we've drawn, and the

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.373
equations that we're going to use. If we want to know how many gallons of

00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:17.981
cleaning fluid Grant can get for $850, what should we look for? The value of y

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:23.926
when x equals 850? The value of x when y equals 850? The slope when x equals

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:31.805
850? Or points of intersection between y equals 850 and other lines?
