00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.750
So, let's look at some of the trends

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.301
for magnetic disks over the years. The capacity of

00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:08.693
magnetic disks, how much data fits on a single

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:13.218
disk, has actually been improving exponentially at the rate

00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:18.180
of about two per one or two years for a while. So things are getting better. We

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.505
get more and more data per magnetic disk. The

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:25.585
seek time has consistently been five to ten milliseconds

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:28.305
over a number of years, with very slow

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:32.752
improvement. The only things that really improve the

00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:34.602
seek time is if we either make a

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:37.710
faster motor that can still move the head assembly

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.020
very precisely, which is very hard to do.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.230
Or if we make the platter smaller so that

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.430
we traverse a smaller distance. So there has

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.710
been some recent improvement in that we have gone

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.750
from five inch diameter disks to three and a half, to more recently two and a

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.141
half and even smaller. So there has been some improvement in seek time, mainly

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:06.780
because the disks have shrunk. The speed of rotation for disks

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.584
has actually been improving. It went from 5,000 rotations per

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:17.470
minute to 10,000 rotations per minute, and even beyond that.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.580
So that part of the magnetic disk speed has been improving. So this type of

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.670
improvement requires improvement in what material is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.966
the platter built out of. Another factor that

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:33.050
has been affecting this is the noise.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.180
Disks that rotate faster, tend to both noisier

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.000
and also create a higher a pitch sound,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.690
which is less pleasant for people. And this

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.066
type of improvement is also relatively slow. And

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.090
the speed of this controllers, and the buses over

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.898
which we transfer data has been improving at an

00:01:51.898 --> 00:01:56.150
okay rate. So really the controller and the bus

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.480
are becoming a smaller and smaller fraction of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.680
the overall disk access time. So the disk access

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.264
time is pretty much dominated by the seek time

00:02:05.264 --> 00:02:09.300
and to a lesser extent now, the rotational latency.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.070
And now you can see why disks have been lagging in improving their

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.230
latency relative to memory and processors. This

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.010
is because seek time requires better mechanics,

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.240
and rotational latency also requires better materials

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.650
and better mechanical properties. Both of which

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.780
are not really subject to something like Moore's Law that we get for processors.
