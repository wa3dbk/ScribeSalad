00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.708
For our second quiz where you have to define your own procedure,

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:05.385
we'll make things a little more complicated.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:07.446
Now you're going to define a procedure.

00:00:07.462 --> 00:00:13.138
We'll call it sum3, and the reason I'm calling it sum3 is because it takes 3 inputs.

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:17.154
This is to distinguish it from the example, sum procedure, that we saw earlier

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:18.873
that only takes 2 inputs.

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:23.508
What sum3 should do is output the sum of those 3 inputs.

00:00:23.508 --> 00:00:27.169
So as an example, if you define sum3 correctly,

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.992
if we print out the result of sum3,

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:35.646
passing in 1, 2, and 3 as the inputs,

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:39.398
the output should be the result of 1 + 2 + 3

00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:43.000
Last I checked, that was 6.
