00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.370
The answer is it will fail for some data sets.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.450
If the user inputs a bunch of numbers that are all

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.610
negative, none of these will ever be greater than 0.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.720
So largest will just stay 0 the whole time even though

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.640
there's no number as large as 0 in the data

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.508
set. Having a 0 in the data set is okay. If

00:00:16.508 --> 00:00:20.738
the data set was negative 2, negative 3, 0, 4,

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:25.250
eventually we would find the 4, and that would be larger

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.088
than 0. We can even take away the 4.

00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:30.539
If the data set was just negative 2, negative 3,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.705
and 0, this code would find that the largest

00:00:32.705 --> 00:00:35.070
number is 0, which is true in this case. So

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.180
having a 0 in the data set doesn't affect

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.240
whether this code works or not. We know it won't

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.770
work because of the example that I gave before. And

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.590
this will work fine even if there's only one input.
