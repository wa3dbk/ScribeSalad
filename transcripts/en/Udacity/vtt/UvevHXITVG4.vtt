00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.019
If we want to change the location of a point, we can use a translation matrix.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.984
This matrix has the translation movement put in the top three positions of the

00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:11.936
last column. The rest of the matrix looks the same as the identity matrix. If

00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:16.030
you multiply a point by this matrix, the one coordinate in the last position of

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.900
the vector multiplies each translation value in turn. This has the effect of

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.015
taking the original point. And adding the translation to it. This may seem like

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:27.791
a convoluted way to add a vector to a point, but you'll soon see that many other

00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:31.810
transforms can be combined and stored in this matrix, translations among them.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.158
With a single matrix multiply, you can then perform any number of

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:40.526
transformations. Say instead you multiply a vector by this matrix. You'll get

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:44.746
the same vector back. The fourth coordinate of the vector is zero. So for all

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:49.261
the translation values that are multiplied by zero, and so ignored. This makes

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:53.530
sense. A vector does not have a location so it can not be translated. The only

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.430
thing mentioning at this point is that this type of matrix and vector notation

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.855
Is called column-major form. There is also a row-major form for notation where

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:06.332
the coordinates are written out in a row. The vector row is multiplied by each

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:10.776
column of the matrix in turn. Personally, this is how I learned matrices 30

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:15.346
years ago. Microsoft's DirectX uses this form. The story I heard as to why row

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:19.973
vectors became popular was due to the influence of Steve Koons. He wrote some

00:01:19.973 --> 00:01:23.662
influential papers on transformations for computer graphics back in the 1960s.

00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:27.135
He said he said he used draw vectors in those papers because it was easier for

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:30.820
the stenographers to type the translation values along the bottom of the matrix

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.480
rather than having to type them in the column. All that said, web GL uses

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.640
column-major notation. In this convention is also the norm in most publications,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.354
so that's all we use here. Either form is fine, they're both just a way writing

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:45.884
down the math. I mostly want you to be aware that there's another form out there

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:49.294
called row major. The good news is that, internally, Web GL and DirectX

00:01:49.294 --> 00:01:53.600
ultimately store the translation values in the same locations in memory. If you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.190
go look at any matrix in memory. You'll see that the last four values are the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.466
three translation values, and then a one.
