00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.768
To add a smoother to this plot, we need to

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:05.880
change geom line to geom smooth. We also need to

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.540
get rid of this fun.y parameter and the stat parameter.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.780
We'll still keep yearjoined.bucket assigned a color, so that way

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.219
we see this segment in our graph. And here I'm

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.620
using the defaults for geom smooth. So R will automatically

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.340
choose the appropriate statistical methods based on our data. All

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.610
of that additional information can be found in the output

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.020
down here. So here again, in this smooth version of the

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.750
graph, we still see that the friendships initiated declines as tenure increases.
