00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.262
The first one be five times the square root of x, and the second one be

00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:08.520
thirteen times the forth root of five. Nice thinking if you got those two

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.905
correct. The key to understanding these problems is that we can only add the

00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:16.768
radicals if the radicands are the same and if the indexes are the same. Here we

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:21.708
have square roots and both of the roots have a radicand of x. So we have three

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:26.208
square roots of x, and two square roots of x. So all together, we'll have five

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:30.254
square roots of x. We're simply combining like terms just as we would with

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:34.502
polynomials or with fractions. Here we combined the x squareds, and here we

00:00:34.502 --> 00:00:38.993
added together sevenths. So in the second example, we're really adding six

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:44.510
fourth roots of 5, and seven four roots of five. So all together, we'll have 13

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.470
fourth roots of 5. The type of radical doesn't change in each case. We still

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.903
have the square root of x in the first one and the 4 through the 5 in the

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:54.553
second one.
