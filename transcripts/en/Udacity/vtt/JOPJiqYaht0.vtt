00:00:00.142 --> 00:00:04.890
Suppose an attacker enters this
malicious string as the user name.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.170
What's going to happen?

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.430
The actual SQL query
sent from the web server

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.700
to the backup database server
would look like this, and

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.810
the result of running this query to
database is to delete all user records.
