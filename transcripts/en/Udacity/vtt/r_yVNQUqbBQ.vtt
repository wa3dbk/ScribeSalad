00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We showed earlier that this was 1/K--1 over the size of K.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now we've shown that the probability of M equals M is equal to the probability

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the message is M divided by the K.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We've shown these two things.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now we just need to plug them into our conditional probability formula.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're going to have this on top, and we're going to divide that by the probability of B,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which is 1 over K.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The "over Ks" will cancel out, leaving us with the probability

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that the message is equal to M&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That's exactly our definition of a perfect cipher.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We can conclude that the one-time pad is a perfect cipher.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It exactly satisfies the definition of a perfect cipher

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
where the cipher text reveals nothing at all about the key.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You might think the class should be over.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We've achieved our goal of perfect secrecy using a cipher

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that was invented over 100 years ago and is actually provably perfectly secret.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We're not going quite done yet.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
There are some pretty serious problems with the one-time pad.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
One problem is that it's malleable.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What malleable means is if Alice sends her ciphertext to Bob,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and our evil interceptor--this times it's not just an eavesdropped,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
it's an eavesdropper with a hammer.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If our interceptor has control over the network,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and instead of just being an eavesdropper can be an active attacker.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
An active attacker means they can actually change messages on the network.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The message that arrives at Bob is not C. It's C'.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Because at the perfect cipher, the attacker can't learn anything new about the message

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
from C, but she could modify it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Maybe she had a pretty good guess.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Maybe there was a number in the message somewhere

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
or something that she wanted to change.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Well, she could flip the bits at that part of the message,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
change the ciphertext that Bob receives to C.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It would decrypt, and with the one-time pad encryption and decryption are the same function.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The decryption of C' would be M'.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The attacker can actually control the difference between M and M',

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because the way the one-time pad works is just XOR.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The attacker could decide whatever difference she wants to introduce in the message.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This is a dangerous property for a cipher to have.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Another big problem with the one-time pad is that it's very impractical.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The real reason that it's impractical is because the keys have to be

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
as long as the messages, and we can never reuse the key.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The is this property that the number of possible keys

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
is equal to the number of possible messages.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Maybe what we should try to do is to find a more practical perfect cipher.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Unfortunately, Claude Shannon proved that that's not possible.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That's what we're going to look at next is why this property that the key space

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
has to be at least as big as the message space i

00:02:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
s a requirement for a cipher being perfect.
