00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:03.990
Let us now go back to example of the baseball pitcher who has to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.190
decide on a action to take in a particular circumstance. So

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.880
we can think of this pitcher as mapping a percept history into an action.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.820
Now imagine that this pitcher is embodying a production system. We are back

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.110
to a very specific situation, and you can certainly read it again. Recall that

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.241
David had given the answer, the pitcher will intentionally walk the batter. So

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:33.310
we want to make the theory of how might the pitcher or internal and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.750
AI agent come to this decision. Recall the very specific situation that

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.780
the pitcher is facing. And recall also that David had come up with this answer.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.240
So, here is a set of percepts, and here is an action. And the question is,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.640
how these percepts get mapped into this action? We are going to

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.190
add one build a theory of how the human pitcher might be making these decisions,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.280
as well as a theory of how an AI agent could be built to make this decision.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.490
So let's go back to the example of the pitcher having to decide on a action in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.764
a particular situation in the world. So the pitcher has several kinds of

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:16.070
knowledge. Some of its knowledge is internal. It already has it. Some of it,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.093
it can perceive from the world around it. As an example, the pitcher can

00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:25.197
perceive the various objects here, such as the bases, first, second, third base.

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:29.507
The pitcher can perceive the batter here. The pitcher can perceive the current

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:34.450
state of the game. The specific score in the inning, the specific batter.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.970
The pitcher can perceive the positions of its own teammates. So, all these

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.330
things the pitcher can perceive, and these then are become exact specific kinds

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.890
of knowledge that each pitcher has. The pitcher also has internal knowledge.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.130
The pitcher has knowledge about his goals and objectives here.
