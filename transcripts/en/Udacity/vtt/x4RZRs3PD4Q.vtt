00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.051
I'm going to start this lesson by noting that tessellate is the most misspelled

00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:07.560
word in computer graphics. So give it a good look and think of doubling every

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.466
letter that you can when you spell it. Yes, 2 Ls looks weird to me too, but

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:16.094
that's how it works, and I force myself to spell it correctly. The word,

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:19.937
tessellate is from the Greek word Tessella, which means a small stone in a

00:00:19.937 --> 00:00:24.635
mosaic. In English, breaking an object into polygons of any sort is called

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:29.114
tessellation. In computer graphics, a curved surface is often represented by

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:33.521
triangles by placing points on surface and connecting these together. For

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:37.943
example, a geodesic dome is 1 tessellation of a sphere, such as the biosphere in

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:42.620
Montral. When it comes to making surfaces the GPU understands only triangles. To

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.924
draw any polygon, we break that polygon into a set of triangles. This process is

00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:51.694
naturally called triangulation, usually we use the existing vertices as the

00:00:51.694 --> 00:00:56.681
polygon when performing triangulation. The major rule is that when we add an

00:00:56.681 --> 00:01:01.334
edge, it has to be entirely inside the polygon. Triangulation is a particular

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:05.990
form of tessellation. Here's the same pentagon tessellated in a fairly arbitrary

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.820
way, with new vertices added inside the pentagon and connected together. Once

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.505
upon a time some older graphics hardware from the 1980's supported objects such

00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:18.886
as polygons or even more complex objects. For example Nvidia's first chip, the

00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:23.663
nv1 supported ellipsoids as a basic primitive. Graphics hardware manufacturers

00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:27.311
quickly came to realize that the triangle is a fine building block for almost

00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:31.550
everything we want to draw. For example one problem with a quadrilateral is that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.016
the surface is poorly defined if all four points are not in the same plane. A

00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:39.438
triangle's three points are by definition always in the same plane and, so, have

00:01:39.438 --> 00:01:44.300
no such problems. By the way the graphics coprocessor I used to develop on in

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.051
the late 1980's cost about $35,000 at the time. It was perhaps at best 1-1

00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:55.784
millionth as fast as the fastest GPU's are nowadays, at only at the price of a

00:01:55.784 --> 00:01:56.203
BMW.
