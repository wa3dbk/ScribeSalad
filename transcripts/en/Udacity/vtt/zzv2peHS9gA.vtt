Before doing that though, let's have a quiz to check whether you remember

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.160
the basics of UML. Since we're going to talk about use cases, I want

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.040
to ask you, what is the difference between a use case and a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.330
use case model. So here are the possible answers, and you can mark

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.710
more than one. First one is that only use case models include actors.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.150
The second is that they are the same thing. The third one is

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.000
that a use case model is a set of use cases. The fourth

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.950
one says that a use case is a set of use case models.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.520
Finally, the last one says that use cases

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.650
are a dynamic representation, whereas use case models

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.880
are a static representation of a system. So

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.810
mark all the answers that you think are correct.
