00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.294
Okay, let's have a quick quiz. So, which of these statements has a coalesced access pattern?

00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:09.155
Here's a simple kernel foo--it takes a pointer to global memory g.

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:15.128
And as a shortcut, I'm going to define a as 3.14 and i as thread index dot x.

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:19.941
So now, each of these statements either reads or writes g or both.

00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:22.622
And I'd like you to tell me, in each case,

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:27.245
whether the accesses to g follow a coalesced access pattern.
