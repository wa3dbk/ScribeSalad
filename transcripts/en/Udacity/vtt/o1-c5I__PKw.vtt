00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.438
So, so far we've been doing
segmentationous clustering, and

00:00:03.438 --> 00:00:06.250
we've been using some feature
space based upon color, and

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.292
then we have these different algorithms.

00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:12.659
One of the challenges is, is that things
like just color or the brightness, or,

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.484
or position,
which is something else we looked at,

00:00:15.484 --> 00:00:17.750
alone are not enough to do segmentation.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.305
And here are some examples.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.979
So you can see that, you know,
that generally in this area here

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:26.090
the colors are about
the same as this area there.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.810
Likewise, the brightness here,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.220
the average brightness is the same
as the brightness over there.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.760
Now you have no problem seeing
the differences between these, but

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.180
that's because you just don't
use brightness positioned color.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.460
You also use texture, right?

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.290
Obviously, the texture here is
different than the texture there.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.300
Likewise on the fawn.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.270
The texture there is quite
different from the texture here.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.273
So the question is,
how would we introduce some,

00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:56.500
some measure that was sensitive
to texture into our segmentation?

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.150
One way of thinking
about texture is this.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.430
So here I have this picture,
'kay, and I've got

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.850
clearly different texture here than I
do here, than I do there, all right?

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.792
So here's one approach.

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:13.320
Let's compute a series
of filter outputs.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.417
So here's a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 oh, 24.

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:17.542
It says 24 right there.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:18.790
Here's 24 different filters, okay?

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.780
And they may have
different orientations,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.430
so here we get different orientations.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.290
And they have different scales, so
they go from a courser scale to a finer

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.070
scale, and here's one's that are just
sort of little center surround.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.700
It almost doesn't matter.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.810
Well, it does matter, but it almost
doesn't matter which filters you use.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.090
The idea is that you're
creating a new set

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.820
of dimensions that you'll have for
every point, all right?

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.190
And when you do that, the idea is
that hopefully along these different

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.330
dimensions, and there's 24 or however
many you have, you would get some

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.590
clusters, depending upon the types of
textures that you have in your image.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.043
And that's what's being shown here,
right?

00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:06.292
Is you have these clusters in
this image space, all right?

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:10.559
And so here's an example of using
let's just suppose we take a look at,

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.093
this is the derivative
in the X direction, so

00:02:13.093 --> 00:02:17.390
how much gradient there is going in
the X direction at one particular scale.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.870
This is one of the dimensions.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.760
And this is in the Y direction, so

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.390
it's your, measure your
gradients in the Y direction.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.127
And the idea is that, well, in this
case, there are little areas that have

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:32.250
in this case, windows that primarily
have vertical edges, right?

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.888
Because they've got strong x-gradient
and no y-gradient, likewise,

00:02:36.888 --> 00:02:38.292
here's horizontal.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:42.201
This has a little window that would
have a texture in both of them and

00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:45.470
these would be areas that have
hardly any gradients at all.
