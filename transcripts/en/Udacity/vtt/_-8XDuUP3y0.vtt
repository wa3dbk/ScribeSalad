Okay, so we know how to calculate the volume of a box if we know the length, the

00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:08.092
width and the height of the box. So let's take another look at how Athena was

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:12.322
folding her boxes. She'd take a piece of paper like this one. Then she would

00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.647
measure a square in each corner of her rectangular piece of paper. Then she cut

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:20.968
the squares out of the corners. And then she would fold up the edges. And tada,

00:00:20.968 --> 00:00:25.173
with a little bit tape we'd have a pretty nicely put together box. So we know

00:00:25.173 --> 00:00:29.541
then we can make box out of a piece of paper that looks like this. It once was a

00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:33.882
rectangle until I cut the squares out of the corners. Let's draw that on here.

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:38.238
So here is a nice little piece of paper for us to start out with. And then I can

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:42.718
draw this to show what it would look like after the corners have been cut out of

00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:48.529
it. Awesome. Now, on the real piece of paper that I was using, this one, the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:54.600
original side length of this long side was seven inches. And the original side

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.058
length of the shorter side was five inches. So let's pretend like this paper has

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:04.986
the same dimensions. So the orginal side length was five inches. And this

00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:09.999
original side length down here was seven inches. Now, Athena and I are both

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:14.897
super careful people, so we made sure that the squares that I cut out of each

00:01:14.897 --> 00:01:20.596
corner are exactly the same size. That means that each of these lengths of a

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:26.708
cutout square is the same. Let's call that length x. Now, I'm going to give you

00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:31.765
a second to refresh your memory on how this box looks when we fold up the sides.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:38.910
So here's my real one again. This length is x. This is seven inches and this is

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.068
five inches. When I fold it up, it looks like this. We have length, width, and

00:01:46.068 --> 00:01:52.158
height. Now, my question for you is, once I fold up this box, what will the

00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:57.333
height of the box be? Please put your answer in this box. And just a hint, it

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.983
may not just be a number.
