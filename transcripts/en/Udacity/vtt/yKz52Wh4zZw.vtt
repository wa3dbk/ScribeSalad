00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.550
Okay. So one of the handy properties of memcached, and one of

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.530
the things that makes a difference from a normal data base is, it

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.030
stores everything in memory. That's why it's so fast because reading from

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.990
memory is very fast. Reading from disk can be very slow. Which, which

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.300
gives memcached a couple of properties. One is that it's fast. Two

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.330
is that if you restart memcached, you lose all your data. So it's

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.160
not durable. You know, if you have to restart that machine or

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.130
restart memcached, the data isn't on disk. It's just in memory, and it's,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.370
and it's, and it disappears. So, you need to keep that in

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.050
mind, that memcached is really just for caching, not for storing permanent

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.150
data. Finally, the amount of data we can store in, in, in

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.760
a particular instance of memechached is limited by how much memory that machine

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.470
has. Or maybe you have a system of machines and your memcached

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.220
library is bouncing over them. You can still only store so much data.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.590
So what happens when you try to store more data than there

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.700
is memory available? And let's do this in the form of a quiz.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.320
Now, I know I haven't told you the answer to this, but see if you can figure

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.428
it out. One of these answers is correct,

00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:58.400
and I'll explain after you give it a shot.
