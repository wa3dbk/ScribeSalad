00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.520
So what answers did you come up with,
David?

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.900
&gt;&gt; So we knew that because the boat
is traveling from the right back to

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.010
the left, that the boat is going to be
on the left in each of the next states,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.970
so we didn't even ask for that.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.600
In the top state, the only things we
could do are move both people back,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.500
just the guard back, or
just the prisoner back.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.620
Moving both back would just take
us back to our original state, so

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.050
while it's legal, it's not productive.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.980
Moving just our prisoner back would have
more prisoners on the left than guards,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.710
so that wouldn't be a legal move.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.150
So our only move is to move
our guard back to the left.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.690
Similarly on the bottom, we could either
move both prisoners back to the left, or

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.860
just one.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.290
Moving both would take us back to our
original state which isn't productive.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.129
Moving just one, then,
is our only legal next state.

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.670
&gt;&gt; That was a good answer, David.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.000
Thank you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.800
Note David, that these two
states that he came up with,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.030
the one at the top here and one at
the bottom here, are in fact identical.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.550
And because they're identical, therefore
we can collapse them into one state.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.000
So, now we get the representation
shown in this figure,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.540
the two states have been
collapsed into one.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.340
&gt;&gt; So in this semantic network, we don't
really care how we got into a state,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.850
just as long as we know
what state we're in.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.770
And that makes sense in this
problem solving process.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.710
Once we're in this state, we don't
care if we got to it this way, or

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.330
this way, all we care about is
the current state of the problem.
