00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.952
Let's write the null and alternative hypothesis in statistical symbols. For the

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:08.558
null, we use a capital H with a subscript 0 to indicate the null hypothesis. We

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:13.298
put a colon to show that what comes after is the null hypothesis. We use mu

00:00:13.298 --> 00:00:17.394
subscript program to indicate what the average amount spent per week on food

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:23.540
would be if we could implement this whole program throughout the entire co-op.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.635
What we're saying here is that if we implemented this new program, the average

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:31.478
amount of money spent per week on food by the co-op members would be either

00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:38.078
equal to 151, the original population mean, or greater. In other words, there

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:42.448
will be no improvement. Now, let's write the alternative. We have some H, the

00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:46.593
subscript A for alternative hypothesis. I'll write alt over here to remind us

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:51.850
that that's what it is. We have a colon in the right place. We input the value

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.086
of the population parameter. If we could go to all co-op members and give them

00:00:56.086 --> 00:01:00.720
this mu program, what would their average cost be per week? And we hope there

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.018
will be a reduction, so we'll write less than 151. Be sure to write these down

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:06.299
on your sheet of paper.
