00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.932
So here is my solution to the programming

00:00:02.932 --> 00:00:05.313
assignment where I asked you to program an

00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:08.193
online version of online SLAM. Let me run it

00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:11.458
and compare it to the offline SLAM. When

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:13.809
I run it, I get random landmarks and a random

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.991
initial robot pose. My offline solution gives me

00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:21.226
this long path over here and estimated landmarks,

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:23.465
and the remarkable thing here is that my online

00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:28.049
version that I coded gives me the same final pose

00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:31.465
and the same landmarks without retaining this huge

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:34.597
matrix for the path before. So how did I do this?

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:36.929
Here is my online SLAM routine. In large parts

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.979
it looks exactly like my offline SLAM routine.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:45.021
I do it in 2D – I have a measurement and motion.

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:49.096
Step, here is my measurement update. I have to

00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:51.057
get all these indices right so you can stare at

00:00:51.057 --> 00:00:52.811
them for a while, but they’re all correct here,

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:55.543
there is a plus one and minus one over here.

00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:57.596
And here is the first nontrivial thing. My

00:00:57.596 --> 00:01:00.057
matrix so far has one robot pose and one

00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:02.605
entry for each landmark, but now I need to

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.739
add space for the next robot pose. And the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.070
way I do this is, I make an expansion list

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.281
using the expand command. And this expansion

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:12.681
list retains the original robot pose, which is

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.004
coded 0 and 1, these are two-dimensional

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.321
poses, and indices for the landmarks.

00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:20.912
So, I’m squeezing in two new rows and two new

00:01:20.912 --> 00:01:23.276
columns for the next robot pose. That’s

00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:24.998
happening in this code over here. With this

00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:28.266
squeezed in, I can now do the update. The

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.470
update is being applied exactly at these two

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.281
new rows and columns that I put in. And here

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.099
is the math I gave you for factorization applied

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.397
to this problem, where I go and compute the

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:41.362
intermediate matrices A, B and C that I

00:01:41.362 --> 00:01:43.148
explained in class. And then I use the take

00:01:43.148 --> 00:01:47.143
command to kick out the very first row and

00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:49.271
column, the first two of them, to remove the

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.974
old robot pose, using the exact same logic

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:55.337
that I gave you in class. So you can look at

00:01:55.337 --> 00:01:59.000
this, this actually implements online SLAM.
