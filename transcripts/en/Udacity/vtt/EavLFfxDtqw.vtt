00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.629
We now know a lot about color, but nothing yet about materials. Say, we have a

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.216
red ball. How do we make the GPU compute how the lights in the scene and the

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:13.856
ball's material interact, so that the ball looks real. When performing

00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:18.548
interactive rendering, the standard way to think about a material's appearance

00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:23.309
is as a few different components added together, emissive, ambient, diffuse, and

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.548
specular. The idea of the emissive term is that it's for coloring glowing

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.848
objects. For example, a lightbulb has its own color and other light sources

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:35.548
don't really affect it. In reality, the emissive term is simply a way to add in

00:00:35.548 --> 00:00:39.827
some constant color regardless of the lighting conditions. The second component,

00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:44.200
ambient, is a fudge factor. Something added in so objects look better especially

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.725
in areas that are not directly lit. You'll see it in various systems controlled

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:52.080
in various ways. When all is said and done, the ambient term helps compute a

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.323
constant color value that is added to the fragment's final color value. The

00:00:55.323 --> 00:00:58.800
emissive and ambient terms are kept separate, as they fulfill different

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.110
functions, and often have different controls. For example, three.js allows you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.390
to set an ambient light that affects all materials with an ambient term.

00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:11.845
Remember that we made a simplification with lights in a scene. We assume photons

00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:15.952
come only from lights, and don't bounce around. In reality, photons would

00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:20.036
reflect from the floor to the bottom of the sphere to our eye. However, with our

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:24.392
assumption, the lower part of the sphere doesn't get any light and so would look

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:28.408
black. The ambient term gives us at least some color in these types of areas

00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:31.906
instead of being entirely black. The diffuse and specular components are

00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:36.238
computed based on the lights in the scene. While the emissive and ambient are

00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:40.268
essentially independent of these, the diffuse term can be though of as a flat,

00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:44.320
matte finish, and specular can be thought of as the shininess of an object. In

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.220
terms of computation, the specular term is also affected by the viewers

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.183
location. While the diffuse term is determined only by each lights location.
