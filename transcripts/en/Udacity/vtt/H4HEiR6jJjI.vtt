00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.796
Just like with the z and t statistics, we want one statistic that describes

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:07.450
these variances in relation to each other, and determines whether or not we

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.794
accept or reject the null hypothesis. First of all, what do you think the null

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:18.376
and alternate hypotheses will be when we're doing ANOVA? Let's just say we're

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:22.655
comparing three samples. Do you think it's this group, this group, or this

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.840
group?
