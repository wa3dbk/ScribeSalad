00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.680
Let's do yet another quiz on the BTB and BHT interaction. Same BHT and BTB

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.690
as in the previous quiz, the same program. The question for you now

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.350
is which BTB entry do we use for each of these instructions. Leave the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.820
field for the instruction blank if none of the BTB entries is used by it.
