00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.764
Now, let's see if you have the hang of this. What do you think would be the

00:00:03.764 --> 00:00:07.546
dimensions of a rectangle that had a perimeter of 25 inches and an area of 32

00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:11.899
inches squared? Write your answer for the length here and you answer for the

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.586
width here. Notice also, that I've already included the units of inches for

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:22.140
both dimensions. You won't need to type that in. And, keep in mind, the length

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.019
is always the longer side. Good luck.
