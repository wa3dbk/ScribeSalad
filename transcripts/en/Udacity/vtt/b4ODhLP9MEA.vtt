00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.848
So Skype has a central log in server but then use a pier to pier to exchange the

00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:11.094
actual voice streams and compresses the audio to achieve a fairly low bit

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:17.163
rate t around 67 bytes per packet and 140 packets per second. We see Skype uses

00:00:17.163 --> 00:00:20.840
about 40 kilobites per second in each direction.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.310
Data packets are also encrypted in both directions.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.970
Good audio compression and avoiding hops

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.440
through faraway hosts can improve the quality

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.650
of the audio, as can for arrow correction. Ultimately, though, the network is

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.630
a major factor. Long propagation delays High congestion, or disruptions as

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.090
a result of routing changes can all degrade the quality of a voice over IP call.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.760
To ensure that some streams achieve acceptable

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.460
performance levels, we sometimes use what's called

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.430
Quality of Service. One way of doing

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.955
Quality of Service is through explicit resservations.

00:01:02.955 --> 00:01:05.280
But, another way is to simply mark

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.880
certain packet streams as higher priorities than

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.680
others. Let's first take a look at

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.070
marking and policing of traffic sending rates.
