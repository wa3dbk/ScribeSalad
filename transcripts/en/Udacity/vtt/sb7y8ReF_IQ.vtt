00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.900
Because the topic of today's lecture is software architecture,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.390
it seemed appropriate to start the lesson by asking a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.960
world expert on this topic, what is software architecture, and

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.570
why it is important. To do that, let's fly to

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.910
California, and more precisely, Los Angeles, and visit Professor

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.540
Nenad Medvidovic. Hi, I'm here visiting Professor Nenad Medvidovic from

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.310
the University of Southern California. And Neno is one of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.250
the world experts in software architecture, actually one of the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.300
authors of, of a recent book which is, sort of the

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.660
book in software architecture. What I would like to discuss with

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.500
Neno is the concept of software architecture and its importance. Because

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520
people are very familiar with the idea and the cost of the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.240
design. And software architecture is something is very related to that,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.690
but is less known. So I would like for Nenad to

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.350
elaborate on that, and tell us why is it important to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.880
focus also on this specific you know, architectural aspects of the software.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.380
&gt;&gt; When you

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.220
build any software system, even a simple, relatively simple

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.840
one. You're going to go through, a process of making

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.070
many, many design decisions. Hundreds or thousands sometimes even tens

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.140
of thousands of design decisions, so any program that you

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.090
write at some point you get to deciding what

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.385
the interface of a particular method is going to be.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:12.170
Are you're going to put in a parameter that is

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.530
an integer or a float. When you're writing your routine

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.400
about some sort you have to decide whether you're

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.900
going to use a static data structure or a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.410
dynamic data structure. All these things are design decisions.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.770
Many of them however, will typically, in the average

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.030
case, not really impact the success of your system

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.640
and the long term well-being of your system. But

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
typically the things that software engineers start struggling with

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.760
are other design decisions. Design decisions that are the equivalent

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.080
of load baring walls in a building

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.660
&gt;&gt; Mm hm

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.950
&gt;&gt; These are the things that, if you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.960
don't get them right, or if you compromise

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.190
them, will in fact potentially impact how the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.300
system operates. They might result in failures of different

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.780
kinds. They may result in a system that

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.460
is not easily maintainable and so forth. In

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.680
a sense, to make a long story short,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.888
architectural design decisions are really the principle design decisions

00:02:05.888 --> 00:02:07.900
in your system. These are the things that are

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.550
very important. All of the other design decisions you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.520
could sort of tag with being important, but they're

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.730
sort of below this very important or highly important threshold.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.400
&gt;&gt; So if you need to change a low level design decision, sometimes

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.970
it's kind of easy to do. It might change a little structure. Is it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.140
the case that you know, being the architecture is sort of the pillar of

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.020
the software, is that going to be much

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.380
more difficult to change an architectural decision?

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.400
And architecture is deemed to be you know,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.120
say if you start with the wrong architecture the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.510
software is going to, you know, necessarily be unsuccessful.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.320
Or you can also do something that is better.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.070
&gt;&gt; A system could be successful and very poorly architected. Just

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.630
like a building or an airplane or a car, any other

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.700
engineering artifact could be successful but poorly architected. So success we

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.440
can separated from this, but the, the point that you make in

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.530
asking this question is an important one. The

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.260
non-architectural design decisions, should be on the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.250
average, there are exceptions and we need to

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.580
acknowledge that there is no one size fits all

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.640
type of solution for anything in software engineering

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.060
really. But on the average, the non-architectural design decisions,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.650
should be much easier to make. So the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.600
scale of the consequences of making such a change.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.880
Really can vary from very minor, highly localized

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.670
to very important and sometimes, even system wide.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.570
&gt;&gt; To conclude, I just like to ask you about some concept that is

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.110
we here about a lot. Which is

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.430
architectural erosion. Since, we're talking about in with

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.760
fine architecture and software evolution. So, what is,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.090
exactly, an architectural erosion and why does that

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.600
happen? So, to go back to our non software metaphors. Imagine you buy a car.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.810
And your car has four wheels, it has a steering wheel, it has

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.700
a nice chassis, it looks pretty nice. At one point, you end up

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.950
replacing its 150 horsepower engine with

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.800
a 250 horsepower engine because that's what

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.510
you want. And you start putting a spoiler on the back of the car

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.680
and then you replace the headlights. And then you replace the side view

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.000
mirrors with smaller ones because you want your car to be more aerodynamic.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.620
And then you start tinkering with other things, like you cut the, maybe

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.380
the roof of the car because you want to turn it into a convertible,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.990
et cetera. And in the end, what you have is

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.810
a car that is still your car. Looks very different, It's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.650
structural and behavioral properties are very different And, what you

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.260
might find is that the car doesn't handle nearly as well.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.670
For example, in a very sharp turn it might not

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.910
be able to negotiate a steep hill as well. Because you

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.760
pretty much changed it all along the way. Architectural erosion in

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.620
the case of a software system is the exact same thing

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.480
with one huge caveat. Very few, if any of us,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.970
will ever put a new engine into our car or tinker

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.390
with the structural soundness of the car by cutting off the

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.260
roof etc. In a software system we do it all the

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.530
time. We'll add a feature. We'll change one bit of the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.088
user interface here. We'll port it to a new platform, some

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:00.990
kind of a, a mobile platform, for example. And pretty soon,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.750
what you end up with is really a software system that,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.990
that is maybe a distant relative of your original

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.500
system. It is a mutant in many ways, because often

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.986
times these little tinkerings happen on a one off

00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:15.610
basis. There is no over-arching vision of how you should

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.060
do this. So, you are basically going through a

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.980
subsequent set of steps where you are making locally optimal

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.240
decisions for any one of these changes and what

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.140
you might end up finding is that the globally optimal

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.100
behavior of the system is badly compromised. The structural

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.952
soundness in a sense of the system badly compromised.

00:05:34.952 --> 00:05:38.510
The non-functional properties of the system could be seriously

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.390
affected. This is how security flaws creep into systems. This

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.250
is how reliability flaws. This is how we use

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.420
the usability of a system often times suffers. And most

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.920
importantly for software engineers, the people who actually build the

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.950
software, the maintainability of the system becomes a huge problem.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.130
Because now you're looking at this thing, it's got all these various appendages,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.170
its original design has pretty badly eroded and yet somehow you have to

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.850
figure out how to keep fixing it. Making sure that it operates in

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.380
a continuous fashion because many of these systems live for 20, 30, 40 years.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for your insight; it is a perfect

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.500
introduction for our lesson. So we'll get to the lesson now. And.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.300
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
