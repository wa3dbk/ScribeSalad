00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.080
The question we want to think about is

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.720
how you could define who your ancestors are. The

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.689
way to think about ancestors. Well, here's you.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.680
Hopefully, you're smiling, because you're enjoying learning about recursive

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.670
definitions. And you had some parents. Let's assume

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.100
you had two. And we won't assume whether of

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.000
not your parents are smiling, but let's hope

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.670
at least one of them is. And your parents

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.090
were your ancestors, but they're not all

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.750
of your ancestors. Your parents had parents, as

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.970
well. These are your grandparents. Grandparents are always

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.760
happy. So, they're all smiling. And your grandparents,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.640
well, they also had parents. Those would

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.620
be your great-grandparents, and so forth. And all

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.750
of these, except yourself, are your ancestors. So

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.620
our goal now is to define that precisely.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.910
Can we come up with a definition that describes

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.550
exactly this same relationship, all the ancestors that you

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.940
have? So the question is, which of these is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.885
the best definition of ancestors? And there are three

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.730
choices, the first has one rule, ancestor is replaced

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.330
by parent of ancestor. The second has two rules,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.540
ancestor is replaced by parent, and ancestor is replaced

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.220
by parent of the ancestor. The third has three rules.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.600
Ancestor is replaced by parent. Ancestor is replaced by parent

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.430
of parent. And ancestor's replaced by parent of parent of ancestor.
