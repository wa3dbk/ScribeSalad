00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.237
So Hillis and Steele scan is fairly efficient.

00:00:02.237 --> 00:00:04.684
It's actually the first scan to be implemented on GPUs.

00:00:04.684 --> 00:00:08.795
Guy Blelloch popularized another formulation of scan in 1990, however,

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:11.090
that is even better at work efficiency.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.373
It's a little bit more complex in terms of the algorithm though, so let's take a look at another example.

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:19.396
This algorithm has 2 stages--first to reduce, then to downsweep.

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:22.450
And let's note that this is an exclusive scan.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.102
So we're going to do a sum scan that is exclusive, on the input array 1 through 8.

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:31.327
And so it's going to, again, have 2 stages.

00:00:31.327 --> 00:00:35.187
The first is going to be a reduction, and it looks similar to the reductions that we've seen already.

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:37.133
And then the second stage is going to be new.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.896
It's going to be a downsweep, and so that's going to take a different operator than we've seen before.

00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:45.931
Let's start with the reduction. The reduce step actually looks like a fairly standard reduction.

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:48.696
The first step adds neighbors 1 hop away.

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:51.488
The next step adds neighbors 2 hops away.

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:54.862
And the third step is going to add neighbors 4 hops away.

00:00:54.862 --> 00:00:58.670
However, unlike in reduce, we're going to keep the intermediate results around.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.363
By intermediate results I mean this 1, this 3, this 3, this 10, 5, 11 and 7

00:01:05.363 --> 00:01:08.715
because we're going to use them during the downsweep step.

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.037
Now step 2, the downsweep.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:15.153
We're going to start by resetting the rightmost piece of data to the identify operator.

00:01:15.153 --> 00:01:20.169
For sum, that identify operator is 0 and now we're going to use a communication

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:25.487
pattern that is exactly the same as what we saw in the reduction step except in mirror image.

00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:28.539
So we see that we have this triangle kind of structure here.

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.565
We're going to do the same thing upside down when we do downsweep.

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:35.222
But what's going to be different about downsweep are 2 things.

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:39.218
The first one is that we're going to use a different operator.

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:43.798
So each operator is going to take 2 inputs, just as we did in reduction,

00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:48.314
a left input and a right input, but it's going to produce 2 outputs, not 1.

00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:52.852
So the left-most output is simply the right output copied to the left.

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:58.175
The right output is equal to the sum because we're doing sum scan of the 2 inputs.

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:03.224
The second thing that's a little bit different is that we're going to be using these intermediate results.

00:02:03.224 --> 00:02:07.960
As we need to do a downsweep between 2 elements, some of the downsweep operators might

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.590
be written down here because we've derived them during the down-sweep.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.274
But if we're missing a piece of data, then we just simply drag down the piece of data

00:02:14.274 --> 00:02:18.290
that we need from the intermediate results that we stored up here during the reduce.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.123
So let's get started. We're going to being the downsweep by operating on this element and this element.

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:27.383
That's, again, the mirror image of the communication pattern that we had before.

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:29.619
So since we don't have an element written here,

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.658
we'll just copy it down from the element that we have, right?

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:37.092
So now we'll apply this down sweep operator to this pair of elements.

00:02:37.092 --> 00:02:41.316
The first we're going to do is we're going to take this 0, copy it over here.

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:45.661
And then we'll take this 10, add it to this 0, and get 10.

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:49.098
Now, we're going to operate on elements 2 to our left.

00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:54.763
So, the 10 is going to be paired with this 11 here, that we've dragged down.

00:02:54.763 --> 00:03:01.464
The 0 is going to be paired with this 3. So 0 will be copied over to the left.

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:04.446
Three and 0 will be added to get a 3 here.

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:09.422
Ten will be copied to the left, and 11 plus 10 is 21.

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:14.947
Now for the final step, each of these elements will be paired with the item to its left.

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:18.630
So, again, we're going to have to drag down intermediate values we kept around.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.708
We're going to drag down the 7, drag down this 5, drag down this 3, drag down this 1.

00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:27.910
And then for the final time apply your downsweep operator--

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.917
0, 0 plus 1 is 1, copy the 3, 3 and 3 make 6.

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:42.554
Copy the 10, 10 and 5 makes 15. Copy the 21, 7 and 21 make 28.

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:47.342
So now our output sequence is 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28,

00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:52.983
which is the exclusive sum scan of the input of the vector from 1 to 8.

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:57.135
What we see, for instance, is that every output such as this 21 here--

00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:01.574
21 is the sum of all the elements that came before.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:06.552
So 21 is the sum of 1 to 6, and so on.

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:10.824
As a quiz I'd like you to compute the max scan of this input sequence--

00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:15.205
2 1 4 3, using this reduced downsweep method.

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:20.043
So you're going to fill in these values from reduction and then fill in each of these values from a downsweep.

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:23.196
And when you finish you should have the max scan,

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:26.790
the max exclusive scan of these elements given these inputs.

00:04:26.798 --> 00:04:29.000
So give it a shot.
