00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.450
If you've got an app that
controls your whole screen,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.040
typically we let the user
swipe the screen away.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.250
But some apps like
the emoji drawing tool,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.540
require the app to draw
all over the screen.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.640
And you don't want the app disappearing
when you're interacting with it.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.730
So you can disable the swiping action.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.440
But then the problem is,
if the app has got the screen locked and

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.030
the swipe is disabled,
then how do you get rid of it?

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.110
So for that,
we have a press to dismiss action.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.210
Let's start up a sample to
see how all of this works.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.320
Let's go to file, import sample, and
we're looking for watch view stub.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.570
So create that with the defaults.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.050
Now that it's ready,
let's run it on the wearable.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.490
You can press and
hold your finger on the screen.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.030
And this X pops up.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.080
And when you tap the X,
the app goes away.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.640
So that's a dismiss overlay view, and
it was included in the sample already.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.830
It's very easy to use.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.880
Let's look at the code for
it in the sample.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.320
If we go to the wearable,
res, layout, main activity.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.390
You'll see we have the dismiss
overlay view defined here.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.500
It's also invisible by default.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.570
You can see here, we grab a reference
to the dismiss overlay view.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.730
Here is where we create
a gesture detector.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.170
And here is where we dispatch that such
events to the gesture detector, so

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.830
that the dismiss overlay
view can receive them.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.840
One limitation of this sample is that,
it does not prevent swipe actions.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.060
If you try it out,
the app will disappear.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.680
So how do we go about preventing that?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.400
The solution is to override
the default theme to do this.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.575
Just go back to the project view,
and go to source, res, values, and

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:28.890
then right-click and
create a new themes.xml file.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.240
We creat our own custom theme like this.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.110
This says to inherit from
the device default theme, and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.220
to implement an attribute windows
swipe to dismiss, and set it to false.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.020
Now we need to activate the theme
in the AndroidManifest.xml.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.600
With the theme activated,
now we can run the sample again.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.760
You'll see that now,
you can not swipe the app away.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.510
But you can exit it using
a dismiss overlay view.
