00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.906
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If we only look at the area surrounding 0, we see that we've shaded to the

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:08.086
right of 0 and also included that point. So, that means x is greater than or

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:12.345
equal to 0. Now, if we only look at the area surrounding 15, 15 is included and

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:16.778
then, we shade to the left. So, x is less than or equal to 15. Every number

00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:23.018
within this range that's shaded is both greater than or equal to 0 and less than

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:25.390
or equal to 15. So we pick and.
