00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:05.596
The LCD would be x squared times x plus 2. Remember we want the highest power of

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:10.472
any factor that appears in a denominator. So we know x is already a factor of x

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:17.180
squared, so we should use x squared. And X plus two for our LCD. Another way to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.590
think about this, is to use our factor tree method to find the LCD of X squared

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.861
and X plus two. We use X squared here, since we know X is already a factor of X

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:32.215
squared. Now don't make the mistake of putting X as the common factor here. X

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:37.986
plus two is one factor. Wgereas X squared has the factors of X and X. The only

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:44.168
common factor for X squared and the quantity X plus two is one. This also makes

00:00:44.168 --> 00:00:50.385
sense because this X is a term inside this factor. So our LCD is X squared times

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:53.653
one times the quantity X plus two.
