00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.188
The final answer is 2 root 35 plus root 15, all divided by 5. Now if you got

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:09.838
this one correct, that's amazing. You've really mastered rationalizing

00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:13.553
denominators. We start rationalizing this denominator by multiplying by the

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:18.410
conjugate divided by the conjugate. Here our conjugate is 2 root 7 plus 2 root

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.524
3. We distribute 5 root 5 to each of these terms to get 10 root 35 plus 5 root

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:28.282
15. For our denominator, we use the pattern of the difference of squares to do

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:33.941
A squared minus B squared. Next, we simplify our denominator. 2 root 7 squared

00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:41.500
is 4 times 7, and root 3 squared is 3. Next, we multiply here to get 28. And we

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.796
really know 28 minus 3 equals 25. Now I notice that each of these terms has a

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:50.607
common factor of 5. I can factor a 5 from each of these, to be left with 5

00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:56.355
times the quantity, 2 root 35 plus one root 15. And for our denominator of 25,

00:00:56.355 --> 00:01:01.352
I'll split it up to factors of 5 times 5. These reduce to 1, leaving us with 2

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:07.130
root 35 plus root 15 in the numerator. And 1 times 5 or 5 in our denominator.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.222
Great work if you found some of the steps or most of the steps to rationalize

00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:13.449
this denominator.
