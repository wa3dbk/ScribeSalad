00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.390
Okay Michael you got answers for me?

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:02.400
&gt;&gt; Think so.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.750
&gt;&gt; Okay good. Alright so let's look at the first one.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.240
Mutually orthogonal. Does that apply to PCA, ICA, both, or neither?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.120
&gt;&gt; So, it was one of the defining properties in PCA, so I would say PCA.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.740
&gt;&gt; Okay that's fair enough. That is actually correct. What about ICA?

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.900
&gt;&gt; I don't, I don't know. It's not one of

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.710
the defining features. It wasn't, it wasn't even thinking about orthugonality.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.160
&gt;&gt; That's right. And in fact ICA by finding independent.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.530
Projections are almost all but guaranteed to find ones that are not mutually

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.010
arthugoial, it doesn't care at all. So in fact this is what makes PCA

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.820
a global algorithm since it has

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.430
this global constraint of mutual arthugoality. Where

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.910
ICA really in its definition that cares about that, so this should be unchecked.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.820
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.310
&gt;&gt; I'm going to put an X there to represent unchecked. Okay, got it?

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.420
&gt;&gt; Okay. What about mutually independent?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.360
&gt;&gt; So,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.780
that was how ICA was trying to construct its, I don't

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.600
want to say features, yeah I guess the, the transformed features.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.050
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.150
&gt;&gt; It was trying to create them to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.330
be mutually independent, so I would check ICA in

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.450
that case. And, PCA didn't use that language

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.110
at all, so I would just not do that.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.880
&gt;&gt; Okay. That's fair. I will point out though,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.740
that it turns out that PCA is trying to do

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.300
something that sometimes will create things that are mutually independent.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.740
But we'll see that when we answer the next question.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010
But you're right, PCA does not care about mutually

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.530
independents. Okay, what about the third phrase, maximal variance?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.280
&gt;&gt; Alright. Again, I feel like this was one of the defining

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.190
features of PCA. So it was trying to choose dimensions that maximize variance.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.500
&gt;&gt; That's right, and what about ICA?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.340
&gt;&gt; In terms of variance? Again, the, the,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.190
there, it wasn't really discussed in that context.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.810
&gt;&gt; Right. ICA is specifically interested

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.211
in notions of independence, statistical independence. Not inpu,

00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:48.710
not in issues of varience. So in fact

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.060
ICA does not care about maximizing varients. Now

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.250
that we have gotten this far let me point

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.020
something out, it turns out that because of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.400
this arthugonal deconstraint this lack of independent contraint,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.460
but this gold and maximizing varience, there are

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.710
cases under which PCA happens to find independent projections.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.130
What's really going on here with these three constraints

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.508
or, or lack of at least one in this

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:12.920
case, is that PCA is tending to find things

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.613
that are uncorrelated. By maximizing variance along arthogonal dimensions is

00:02:18.613 --> 00:02:23.800
finding uncorrelated dimensions. And that makes some sens given

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.060
what it's trying to do. But that is not the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.600
same thing as finding things that are statistically independent.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.050
Again there is this particular case, there is a specific

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.210
case where that does work out, and that's

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.180
when all of your data is in fact Gaussian.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.420
&gt;&gt; Oh, interesting.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.250
&gt;&gt; And why Gaussian? Because it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.860
turns out that the distribution that maximizes

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.420
variance is in fact the normal

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.390
distribution. That's my interpretation of a normal

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.980
distribution. So maximizing variance means that what PCA is doing is it's trying

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.730
to find a bunch of orthogonal Gaussians. More or less. Does that make sense?

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.640
but, you were saying that it, and it aligns with ICA in that case?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.130
&gt;&gt; In that case yes, because it turns out that uncorrelated ends up being

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.230
independent under very specific distributions. But that's

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.880
a coincidence it's not a normal fact.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.940
&gt;&gt; Ha, ha.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.870
&gt;&gt; But by the way this, this is probably worth

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.110
pointing out here something that at least I think is

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.970
kind of interesting here. Which is since ICA is only

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.120
trying to find things that are. Independent of one another.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.910
Here's our little symbol for independence. As opposed

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.205
to things that are uncorrelated, things that are

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:30.890
[INAUDIBLE], it turns out that whatever it is

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.220
PCA is doing, it is not working under

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.000
the same underlying model as ICA. let's think about what ICA is trying to do. ICA

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.390
is trying to find a bunch of these

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.088
prjections all of which are statically independnet. RIght?

00:03:44.088 --> 00:03:45.213
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:45.213 --> 00:03:48.540
&gt;&gt; What happens if I take a whole bunch of statically

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.350
independent variables and I add them together? In other words

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.740
I create linear combination of them. What am I going to

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.430
&gt;&gt; get? A bunch of sums of things that are

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.260
independent? Right and what does that tend towards in the limit?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.830
&gt;&gt; I want to say that the law of large numbers tells us that it turns normal.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.810
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. If I take a bunch of independent variables and

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.770
I sum them together, that is, I create a linear combination, I in fact

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.490
end up with a gouache. And that is

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.970
the central limit theorem. So one argument you might

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.540
make is that if you believe in a

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.410
world where there are independent causes giving rise to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.070
observables, which is what ICA believes, then whatever

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.980
you do, you should not be maximizing variance, becasue

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.750
you're guaranting the summing together otherwise independant variables.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.110
Oh, I see. I see, I see. So by

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.640
trying to find things that are maximal variants it's trying to

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.370
mix together through the central unit theorem all these things that

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.190
are independent, so it's, it's, it's, it's, specifically not teasing apart

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.770
the independent things, it's trying to smush together the independent things.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.910
&gt;&gt; Right. Under certain assumptions

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.880
about the distributions of these individual

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.160
variables. So another assumption that I see us making is not just

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.080
that these variables are independent, but that they are hightly non-normally

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.250
distributed. And if that's the case, then ending up with things that

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.630
look like gaussians, has got to be exactly the wrong thing to do.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.820
If that assumption holds to be

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.990
true. Okay. What about maximum mutual information?

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.230
&gt;&gt; My understanding of what you describe for ICA said that this is

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.780
what it's trying to do. It's trying to find a new feature space

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.820
where the features are maximally. The

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.880
mutual information between them is large as

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.880
possible. So I would check the ICA in that case and not the PCA.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.640
&gt;&gt; Let

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.660
me be Let me clarify soething you said. How can it be trying to

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.010
maximize mutual information while also trying to

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.070
make things that are mutually independent. I

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.510
think you would describe them both in the same language. So what is it

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.890
trying to make mutual independent? Different features.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.090
The, the new, the new transform features.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.990
&gt;&gt; Right. So each of the new transform features is independent with all the

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.430
other new transform features. So what is

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.180
it trying to maximize mutual information between?

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, the, I see. The the information that

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.760
content of the original features and the new features.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.870
&gt;&gt; Right. So this is about joint mutual information between

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.480
all the original features together and All of the transform features.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.640
There it's trying to maximize mutual information. But inside the

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.360
new transform features it's trying to make them pair-wise mutually independent.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.210
&gt;&gt; Alright. I think I said that wrong because I understood

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.630
it wrong. So thank you for clarifying.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.200
&gt;&gt; You're welcome. But now you understand it right.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.295
&gt;&gt; Maybe.

00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:27.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's go with that because

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.830
you got the checkmark right. What about PCA?

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.090
&gt;&gt; Just X that. I don't understand what that would mean.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.110
&gt;&gt; Right. So if I were to put something here that it

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.180
could get a check mark for, what I put down is maximal reconstruction.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.950
&gt;&gt; right.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.870
&gt;&gt; Right. And notice that maximal reconstruction of your

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.720
original data is not the same thing as maximizing

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.780
mutual information. Thought of course in the limit they work out to be the same.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.090
&gt;&gt; Interesting, okay.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.170
&gt;&gt; But the one project that maximizes variance is not

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.670
necessarily the same as the first projection you find for

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.660
maximizing mutual information. So these things really are doing two

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.819
completely different things. Okay, last two what about ordered features?

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:11.500
&gt;&gt; So, in PCA, it was actually assigning, you know,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.220
taking the maximum variant to dimension first and then the next,

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.521
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:18.080
&gt;&gt; You know, after that's been subtracted out, whatever

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.830
has the largest remaining variance and so forth. So

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.640
that the features end up coming out in, in

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.700
a very specific order. And it has the property that

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.080
you could drop the, the last group of features

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.920
if you want to still have as high a

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.500
reconstruction area as possible, given the number of features

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.670
that you keep. So I would check PCA for that.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.570
&gt;&gt; Okay, good. What about ICA?

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.080
&gt;&gt; You didn't say anything about the ordering or

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.790
how you'd actually find features. It seemed like in the

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.680
blind source separation example you gave It just, came

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.060
out with the three, so I'm going to say not ordered.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.790
&gt;&gt; That's right and in fact, if you

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.570
think about the blind source separation example, how

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.100
in the world would you order people anyway.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.700
I mean, other than in the obvious way.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.600
It just doesn't really mean anything. I say it doesn't

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.410
have a notion of causes being more important than other

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.450
causes merely that they're independent. So, it doesn't really worry

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.030
about ordered features. It turns out in practice That you

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.960
can actually try to order the features by using something

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.190
called kertosis. Which is the fourth central moment of a

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.460
distribution. But that's really just something that's useful in some

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.320
specific cases, almost by coincidence. ICA, itself, does not particularly

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.730
care, about ordering. At least not classical ICA.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.549
Okay, what about the last one, bag of features?

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:38.990
&gt;&gt; So, I. Would view what you just said about ICA as implying that

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.840
what ICA produces is a bag of features. There's no particular ordering to them.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.539
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:44.670
&gt;&gt; It's just a collection of things that

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.280
make up the whole. I guess, you know,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.840
PCA, after you've thrown away whichever features you

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.270
don't want. The features that remains are just features.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.740
They could be treated as a bag, I guess. So I don't know if

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.100
I would check that or not. I. For symmetry I guess I would say not.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, but I'm going to say yes because

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.580
in ordered set of features is still a

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.860
bag of features. But we would accept either.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.260
Either a check or an x, both are sort

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.130
of fine. So then, what do we really learn from this, Michael? I think what we've

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.730
learned is these things have fundamentally different assumptions

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.510
and are really trying to do completely different things.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:16.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.410
&gt;&gt; The

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.110
only thing they have in common is that

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.950
they're still trying to capture the original data somehow.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.810
&gt;&gt; Alright. I understand that, but I also learned the opposite, which is

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.090
that they are really closely related and are trying to do very similar things.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But their underlying models

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.600
are different. So maybe that, that's actually

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.170
a good point, Michael. So maybe a better way of saying it is,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.010
their sort of fundamental assumptions are

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.580
different. Even though they're trying to do

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.190
the same thing, which is capture the original data in some new transform space

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:48.780
that is somehow better. But if you think about it that way, there

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.400
are two different optimization functions, two different

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.110
fitness functions, two different cost functions. So

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.890
even though they're trying to do

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.380
the same thing. Reconstructing. Keeping the data

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.900
around. Their basic assumptions about the way

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.860
that data is constructed is very different.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.420
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.240
&gt;&gt; Okay.
