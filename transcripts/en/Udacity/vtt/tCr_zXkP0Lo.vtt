00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.550
Let us look at this learning by the recalling cases a little bit more closely.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.750
Implicit in our discussion so far has been the notion of most similar or

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.700
most closely resembling. But how can we operationalize it? How can we make it

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.470
more explicit? So once again here is a world of various colored blocks and

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.800
we can represent these various blocks back to the notion of knowledge for

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.250
presentation. We can represent our knowledge of these various blocks.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.360
In a two dimensional grid, the width of the block and the height of the block.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.740
So the blue block may right here, the red block here and so on. So when the new

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.920
problem comes along we may represent it on the same two dimensional grid.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.530
In this particular case the new problem might have been represented in

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.990
this particular dot. Now given all the cases in the new problem we may calculate

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.550
the distance between the new problem to each of the previous known cases.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.080
Once we have calculated between the new problem and

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.330
each of the previous cases we can simply select a case which is

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.920
closest to the new problem. This method is called the nearest neighbor method.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.580
Now we need a way of calculating the distance between a problem, in that case.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.750
One measure of the distance is called the Euclidean distance. Here is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.850
a formula for the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two points,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.430
x of c and y of c, which define the case, and the x of n and

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.630
the y of n, which define the problem, is given by this formula.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.980
Now we can easily calculate the Euclidean distance between each of the cases and

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.850
new problem, and this table summarizes the distances. Given this table, we can

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.290
very quickly see that the case of the black block is closest to the new problem

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.340
and therefore one might give the answer the new block is also black in color.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.220
So the nearest neighbor method is one method of finding the most similar case or

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.860
the most closely resembling case.
