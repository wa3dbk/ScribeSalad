00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's now go back and write a program

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in which we calculate the new mean and the new variance term.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I really just want you to write a Python program

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that implements those equations so that we can test them.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm giving you a skeleton program, which has a function update,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that takes as an input a mean and a variance for the first distribution

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and a mean and a variance for the second distribution

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and outputs the new mean and the new variance of the product of those.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here I am testing it with a mean of 10 and a variance of 8

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and a mean of 13 and a variance of 2, which was one of our examples.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Out should come the answer over here--12.4 and 1.6.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Of course, Python tends to not give you the exact output,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so there are a couple of zeros over here but ignore those.

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The answer is effectively 12.4 and 1.6. Can you fill in those gaps?
