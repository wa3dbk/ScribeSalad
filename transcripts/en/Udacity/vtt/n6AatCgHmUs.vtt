00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.640
I'm back with Yunha
again from Locket and

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.530
we're going to be discussing design
principles and the user experience.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.630
And specifically for Locket, what did
you know you needed to get right for

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.540
the user experience?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.130
&gt;&gt; I think because it's the lock screen,
which is what you're so used to,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.755
your default experience, so we're
basically changing that experience.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:22.300
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.250
&gt;&gt; And
saying that this is a new lock screen.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.690
This is a real estate swiping
over 150 times per day.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.677
We need to make it very user-friendly.

00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:33.830
And the goal of the lock screen is so
that you can unlock it so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.050
that you can go to your home screen.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.300
So we can't make it too
long of a process, either.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.680
We want to make it simple.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.490
Also, you don't know who you're going
to be with when you check your phone,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.200
so the lock screen needs to be okay for
your kids to see.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.180
Or for
you to be able to just wake up to it.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.370
So it needs to be delightful as well.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.580
So when we were building the content
on the lock screen which is currently

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.060
locked, if we were just using
the RSS feeds out there.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.411
&gt;&gt; And just like slapping those
images on the lock screen,

00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.510
it might not be delightful.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.110
You might see a lot of blood or

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.792
there might be gun involved
on the lock screen.

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:16.519
So we had to start from a manual
place where we want to make sure

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:21.051
each lock screen that we're delivering,
to our user, is delightful and

00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:24.870
something that you want to wake up to,
that you can see.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.870
But at the same time, we also need to
deliver these real content, which is,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.530
like, hey there's
an earthquake coming up, so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.920
you can't be like a smily face, right.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.970
So how do you walk that fine line.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.480
Also on the lock screen
interaction side,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.530
because you're unlocking your phone.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.600
And you have some users that
are unlocking with the left hand

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.720
versus right hand.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.970
You got to make sure that the button
here on the lock screen is something

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.110
that you can touch
from different angles.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I should be able to touch it.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.790
And if this is like two below,
it's hard to do that with the one hand.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.810
You have to hold it with both hands.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.320
And also, android phones,
their fragmentation is crazy.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.340
You have like your Nexus to the big
tablet, you have the small phones.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.101
How do you make them all look okay,
on all of those devices?

00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:12.635
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:15.510
&gt;&gt; So a lot of those
considerations are involved.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.290
And also like the weather.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.780
How do you make the weather
shown while in the clock?

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.790
People also want to customize their lock
screen, so I customize it using Locket.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.860
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Where you can just upload

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.425
your own photo.

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:28.200
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.900
And, are there any other
sort of design principles?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.510
We talked a little bit about
sort of knowing your customer,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.695
when they're using the product.

00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:35.460
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Knowing that

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.390
maybe they might be around other people,

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.030
what sort of other design principles
went into building Locket?

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.492
Maybe in terms of like an aesthetic
viewpoint or something like that.

00:02:45.492 --> 00:02:46.930
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.520
So when we were,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.480
yeah a few things that we were thinking
about is like making it delightful.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.060
Like is this something that you
want to see on your locked screen

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.740
every single time?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.820
Also, is this something that you feel
comfortable sharing with your niece or

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.880
a kid that you have.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.410
We have a few guidelines as in like,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.360
we have our own Locket brand guidelines
where you're not allowed to use red on

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.220
the lock screen or blood,
something like that.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.611
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:20.194
&gt;&gt; I can't really think of one well, but

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:23.440
we were always focusing
on delightfulness.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; On the lock screen.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.430
&gt;&gt; Great.
