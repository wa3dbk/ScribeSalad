Building means in house custom development.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.689
The advantages and disadvantages mirror those of buying.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.600
The build solution may cost you more,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.500
because you don't have the same economies of scale that a vendor might have.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.660
However, you can tailor what you build to your own situation.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.970
You also retain control of its intellectual property.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.860
However, overall delivery risk is increased when you build things yourself.
