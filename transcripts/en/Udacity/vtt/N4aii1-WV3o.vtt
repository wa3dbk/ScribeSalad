00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.120
Okay. Have you ever wondered how you could write the equivalent of

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.300
a Watson program or a CD program for your own computer?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.200
Just imagine if you could talk to your machine in terms of stories.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.920
Simple stories. Perhaps just one sentence stories like Ashok ate a frog. Now,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.710
we've already seen how a machine can make sense of this particular sentence,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.780
Ashok ate a frog. We did that last time. But, of course, eat or

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.130
ate can occur in many different ways in sentences. Here are some of the other

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.410
ways in which I can use the verb eat. Ashok ate out at a restaurant.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.920
I could tell something was really eating him. And, the sense of eating him here,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.500
is very different from the sense of eating here. There's no physical object that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.730
is being eaten here. The manager would rather eat the losses. So now this is

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.250
a very different notion of eat. The river gradually ate away at the riverbank.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.750
Yet another notion of eat. So just like we had in the previous lesson,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.400
take, the word take, which had so many different meanings, eat has so

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.700
many different meanings. Now when we were discussing the word take,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.320
we discussed how we can use both the structure of sentences as well as

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.150
background knowledge to disambiguate between different interpretations of take.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.160
We could do something similar with eat.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.050
We could enumerate all the different meanings of eat, then for each meaning of

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.290
eat, we could ask ourselves what is it about the structure of the sentence and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.100
what is it about the background knowledge I have about things like rivers and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.730
river banks which tells me what the meaning of ate here is.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.330
To summarize this part, if you were to start talking to your machine in stories,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.560
in terms of simple stories designated by a single sentence, then one problem

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.940
that will occur is, that words like ate or take will have large number of

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.770
meanings. And we have seen how your machine can be programmed in such a way so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.950
as to disambiguate between different kinds of meanings of the same word.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.480
Now here is a different problem that occurs. Consider a number of stories again.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.420
Each story here is designated by a single sentence. Ashok ate a frog,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.690
Ashok devoured a frog, Ashok consumed a frog, Ashok ingested a frog, and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.270
so on. Several sentences here. And if we think about it a little bit,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.430
each of these sentences is using a different verb. But

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.150
the meaning of each of these words in this sentence is pretty much the same.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.500
So whether Ashok ingested a frog or Ashok devoured a frog or

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.060
Ashok dined on a frog, exactly the same thing happened in each case.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.080
There was a frog that was essentially outside of Ashok's body and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.500
then Ashok ate it up and at the end the frog was inside Ashok's body.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.440
The frog was dead and Ashok was happy. So the next challenge becomes, how can

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.560
a machine understand that the meaning of each of these words here is exactly

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.400
the same? In a way this problem is the inverse of the problem that we had here.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.310
Here the problem was that we had a single word like eat, which had got a lot of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.400
different meanings and different context in different sentences.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.980
Here, the issue is that we have a lot of different words, but

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.010
they have the same meaning given the context of the sentences. So

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.370
another question then becomes, well how can we make machines understand that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.280
the meaning of these words in the sentences is exactly the same?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.470
Each of the sentences telling us exactly the same story. There is

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.360
one other thing that is important here, and that is the notion of context.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.970
One of the hardest things in AI is, how do we bring context into account?

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.230
In both of these cases, context is playing an important role. On the left side,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.960
context is playing an important role because we understand that the meaning of

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.930
eat is different in these different sentences, because the context of

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.713
eat is different. Here context is playing a different role. We understand that

00:03:34.713 --> 00:03:38.502
the meaning of each of these words is practically the same because the context

00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:43.450
here is practically the same. A couple of quick qualifications here. First,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.430
right now we're dealing with stories that are just one sentences. Very soon in

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.430
the next lesson, we'll deal with stories which are much more complicated,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.900
which really have a series of sentences. For now, just simple stories.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.330
The second is that here is structural all of these sentences is the same. So

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.550
structure practically tells us something about the context. But

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.550
a situation is a lot more complicated because often two sentences,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.440
which have very different kind of structures can still have the same meaning.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.560
So consider these two studies. Bob shot Bill, and Bob killed Bill with a gun.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.090
Now here the sentence structures are very different, but their interpretations,

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.680
their meaning are the same. Bill was the one who got killed. Bob was the one who

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.640
did the killing. And the killing was done by putting a bullet into Bill.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.840
So the question now becomes, how can we build AI agents that can meaningfully

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.320
understand stories like this one? And stories are the kind that Bob shot Bill,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.720
and Bob killed Bill with a gun. One thing we could do is, that for

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.510
each of the verbs here we could have a frame like we had a frame for take.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.090
So we could have a frame for ate, a frame for devoured, a frame for consumed,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.840
a frame for ingested, and so on. Well, we would have a lot of frames then.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.730
Because there are a large number of verbs in the English language or

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.650
in any other modern language. Perhaps we could do something different.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.252
Perhaps we could look that there is a similarity between the interpretation of

00:05:13.252 --> 00:05:16.660
these things. Perhaps we could use the same primitive action for

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.220
each one of them. So when we talk in English language, we might use for

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.620
communication purposes all of these verbs. But perhaps we could compare AI

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.400
agents that have a single internal representation for

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.440
each one of them. What might that internal representation look like? We will

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.970
call that representation a primitive action. Each one of these is an action. But

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.830
many of these actions are equal in terms of our interpretation of those actions.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.760
Let's see what these primitive actions might look like.
