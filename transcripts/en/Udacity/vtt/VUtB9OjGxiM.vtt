00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.550
Now that you know about the different
states in the activity lifecycle,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.200
how do you tell the system that you
want to know about certain transitions?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.030
So for example, you probably only want
to show an animation on the screen,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.475
if the user's actively
looking at your activity.

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:16.155
And you want to stop that
animation as soon as the screen is

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.535
not visible anymore.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:20.665
Well, similar to click handling,
the system will signal to you

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:24.255
that a lifecycle transition is
happening via a method callback, and

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:26.795
each of the transitions
gets its own callback.

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:29.185
So using these callbacks, it gives you,

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:33.405
as a developer, an opportunity to
intervene and execute statements.

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:37.600
So things like restoring, or saving any
data, or even cleaning up references

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.660
that you no longer need at
the moments that you need them.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.360
So here I am in the numbers activity and
you may have noticed that we've been

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.420
writing the majority of our code in
the activities on create method.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.790
So this is a callback that the system
executes once it has created your

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.450
activity, and thus by overriding
the method in your class definition,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.360
you're able to specify what you
want to happen during that stage.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.110
Also this is where we inflate
our layout XML resources,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.390
obtain references to the view
that we want to manipulate and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.820
initialize any other crucial objects
that our app relies on to function.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.460
Now in the Android
developer documentation,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.080
if we look at the activity class,
it shows all the system callbacks for

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.430
the various states of
activity lifecycle.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.040
So you can override any of these
methods within your actively class

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.750
if you want to execute some code,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.020
when the activity transitions
into a particular state
