00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.417
I said earlier, that the reason that we need to put parentheses around 3w plus

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:06.809
12n, or the total amount of money that Grant would have gained from the orders

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:12.716
that have not been cancelled, was because this was one sum of money. We want to

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:16.860
subtract the whole thing, not just part of it. If we didn't have parentheses

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.720
here, then we'd only be subtracting the money that he would've earned from the

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.690
wipers that are now cancelled. But we would still be adding the amount of money

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.600
that he would have gotten from the nozzle orders that are now cancelled. But we

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.592
know that both of these sets of orders have been cancelled. So we need to make

00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:34.536
sure that both of them are subtracted from the original sum of money. So let's

00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:37.896
put those parentheses back. However, I don't really want those parentheses here

00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:41.820
in the end version of this expression. So we need to get rid of them somehow.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.590
Intuitively like I just said, you want to subtract both this quantity, 3w, the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.418
money from the canceled wiper orders, and this quantity 12n, the money from the

00:00:49.418 --> 00:00:54.240
canceled nozzle sales. So we want to subtract both of them, and if I get rid of

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.030
these parenthesis, I should just be able to switch this plus sign to a minus

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.501
sign, and have the expression that I want. This makes sense. Here's our

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.637
original amount of money, that Grant would have earned from all of the orders

00:01:04.637 --> 00:01:07.479
that he had, and then we take away both the wipers that he's not selling

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.764
anymore, and the nozzles he's not selling anymore. That makes sense. Now, the

00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:15.809
problem is simple, you've done this so many times before. You just need to

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.561
rearrange the order of the term, so that like terms are next to each other, and

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.272
then simplify. So first we rearrange the order of the terms, so the w terms are

00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:25.940
next to each other, and the n terms are next to each other. And then you just

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.616
add they're coefficients together, and multiply it by the proper variables. So

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:33.923
87 minus 3 is 84, and the variable there is w, and 72 minus 12 is 60, and the

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:42.010
variable there is n. So here's our final answer, 84w plus 60n, awesome job.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.962
That quiz had a bunch a steps in it, and some new material. So if you got it

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:46.939
even partially right, that's really great.
