00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.736
So relative minimum is a value of the function that is lower than other values

00:00:04.736 --> 00:00:09.432
of the function, but just values that are near that point. So, this is why the

00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:14.094
point "D" on this function over here is a relative minimum since we know that

00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:18.312
the range of this graph goes all the way down to negative infinity D Is

00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:22.848
definitely not the lowest point on the graph. In fact we can see, looking at

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:26.352
points over here. To the left hand side of the graph. That there are values

00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:30.380
visible to us right now. That are lower than the value of the function at D.

00:00:30.381 --> 00:00:35.308
However, compared to all the values adjacent to D. Whether you move to the left

00:00:35.308 --> 00:00:39.191
or to the right, the function has its lowest value at this spot. This is

00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:43.175
different from a global maximum like at G. There's no other point on this

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.660
parabola where the function has a lower value than it does at G.
