00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.699
Here are the answers that I got. The length method returns the number of

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.644
individual characters in the string. There were 7. The substring method

00:00:08.644 --> 00:00:15.284
extracts a substring that sits inside the bigger string. In our case, it

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:19.925
extracted this string. Whenever you want to extract substrings, you have to

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:24.534
understand how the positions in a string are numbered. In Java the initial

00:00:24.534 --> 00:00:29.418
position is 0, that may sound strange but it's actually pretty useful, and then

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:35.568
it goes from there. The string has length 7 and the position's in it are 0, 1,

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:41.664
2, 3, 4, 5, 6. That's 7 position's. Now in the substring here you see this 3

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:47.113
here. That is the position of the first character that we want to include in

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:52.873
the substring. The seven here is the first position that we don't want to have

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:57.632
anymore. We don't want position seven. In fact, there is no position seven. We

00:00:57.632 --> 00:01:02.083
want the ones from three to six. That sounds a bit odd to most people when they

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:06.680
see it the first time. But there is an advantage. When you subtract these two

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.280
numbers, 7 minus 3, that's 4, and that's the length of the substring that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.790
you're extracting. The next method here, the indexOf method finds the position

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.004
of a given character. So, over here I want to know where does the C occur for

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:25.126
the first time. And it will go through and say, that's at position three. And

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:29.760
finally, you already seen this plus operator in lesson two. It takes two

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.220
strings and glues them together or as we like to say in programming is, it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.675
concatenates them. So, here is the concatenation of Hello and Udacity, notice

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:45.644
there's no space in between because there was no space in either this or that

00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:51.713
string. If you wanted a space, you'd have to add a space. Strings are really

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:56.074
useful when you work with text. Sarah has a couple of nifty exercises prepared

00:01:56.074 --> 00:02:01.454
for you when you get to work with a rather long text and take it apart. And put

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:05.065
pieces back together by using some of the string methods that you've seen here.

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:06.860
Enjoy.
