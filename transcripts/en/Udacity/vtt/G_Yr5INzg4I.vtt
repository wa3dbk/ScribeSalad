00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.310
Threads can have many different relationship patterns. For much of the rest

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.810
of the unit, we will look at an example of the producer

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.080
consumer pattern. Before going into that however, I want to put it

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.990
in context by taking a broader view of possible thread relationships. To

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.680
give our thread something to do, we'll imagine that we are servicing

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.800
some requests that come through a queue. In the team model, we

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.200
have a pool of worker threads that all look in the queue,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.790
fetch the next request, and service it. This idea of a worker pool

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.480
is common to many patterns. The costs of creating a new

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.350
thread are fairly high, so rather than spending time creating and

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.010
destroying threads, applications will simply let the threads wait around until

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.340
there is work for them to do. A model similar to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.330
the team model is the dispatcher model. Here instead of having

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.175
a whole team of threads constantly looking at our queue and

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:47.500
possibly creating some contention, we have a single dispatcher thread looking

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.050
at the queue. He finds an available worker and passes the request

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.570
off to the worker to be serviced. Instead

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.950
of dividing up the work by requests, it's also

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.560
possible to divide it up by subtask. This is

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.630
the strategy employed in the pipeline model. One thread

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.910
DQs a request, does part of the work,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.970
and then passes it on to another thread who

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.780
does part of the work, passes it on, etc.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.780
So, all three of these models are commonly used.
