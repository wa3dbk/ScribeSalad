00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is it would mean that NP is a subset of BQP.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It wouldn't mean that RSA is secure.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In fact, we know because of Shor's algorithm,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
if someone can build a sufficiently large quantum computer,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
they would be able to break RSA.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But it would increase our confidence, because it would put factoring

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in the class of problems that are believed to be hard to solve in polynomial time

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
as long as P is not equal to NP.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If it's also showing that P is not equal to NP,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
then this would mean that there is not any polynomial time solution for factoring

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
with a classical computer.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That would greatly increase our confidence that RSA is secure.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
To see why this is the case, we can think about how complexity classes as sets of problems.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That makes the green circle the class NP.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We have the class BQP, which is not known whether it's a subset of NP.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We have the problem factoring, and we know factoring is somewhere in this circle.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The reason we know factoring is NP is we have solutions

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that solve it in non-deterministic polynomial time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Even the brute force solution, if we could execute all those passed at once,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
would solve it in polynomial time.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The other way to see that it's an NP is there's an easy way to check if the answer is correct.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That's just multiplication.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That's enough to know that factoring is definitely within the NP circle.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We also know that it's within BQP.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If it's known to be NP hard, that would mean it's as hard as the hardest problem in NP.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's also known to be in BQP, so that would mean that we'd have to squish--

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
everything in the circle would now be inside BQP,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
because there is no problem that would be harder than factoring in NP.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I hope those of you who haven't yet studied the theory of computation

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
will forgive the full excursion, but this is a really important point to understand

00:01:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what the security of RSA relies on--these assumptions about problems being hard.
