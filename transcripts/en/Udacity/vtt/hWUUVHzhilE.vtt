00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.705
So how would you use a production system to design an agent that

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:06.160
can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. We could think about this kind of at

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.430
two different levels. At one level we could imagine a production system that's

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.300
able to address any incoming problem. It has a set of rules for what to look for

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.030
in a new problem and it knows how to reply when it finds those things. But

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.240
on the other hand, we can also imagine production rules that are specific to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.070
a given problem. When the agent receives a new problem, it induces some

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.210
production rules that govern the transformation between certain figures and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.600
then transfers that to other rows and columns. So in that way, it's able to

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.340
use that same kind of production system methodology to answer these problems,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.390
even though it doesn't come into the problem with any production rules written

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.760
in advance. So, inherent in this idea though, is the idea of learning from

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.780
the problem that it receives. How is this learning going to take place? How is

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.360
it actually going to write these production rules, based on a new problem? And

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.110
what's the benefit of doing it this way? What do we get out of actually having

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.010
these production rules, that are written based on individual problems?
