00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, for our first question about procedures,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The question is, "What does the 'inc' procedure defined below do?"

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And here's the code for defining 'inc.'

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We're going to define the procedure that takes one input;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we'll call that input "n,"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and we are going to have our return statement

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where the expression following the return is "n+1."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So what does this procedure do?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The choices are: Nothing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It takes a number as its input, and outputs that number plus one.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It takes a number as input, and outputs the same number.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Or--the final choice--it takes two numbers as inputs,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and outputs the sum of those two numbers.
