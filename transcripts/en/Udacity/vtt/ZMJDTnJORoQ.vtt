00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.008
Now that we've talked explicitly about
what it means to combine like terms, or

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:08.096
combine terms that have the same variables
with the same powers in the them, I'd like

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:12.252
you to try an example of how to do this.
Please simplify this expression,

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:17.895
7x+5y-10x+3y.
Start by figuring out which terms in this

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:21.856
expression are like terms, and then figure
out how to combine them. Good luck.
