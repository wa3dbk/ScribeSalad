00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.188
So, it is the range then if it is not all the real numbers. Well, we know that

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:08.676
the minimum point the lowest value that's a member of the range is negative 2.25

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:13.028
and because the graph actually passes through that point and includes it you

00:00:13.028 --> 00:00:17.490
need a square bracket. Following the graph in either direction though,we can

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.450
tell that the values of f of x are just going to continue to increase as the

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.106
values of x increase. And the same thing will happen in the other direction as

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:30.639
well, as x values decrease, n of x values increase. This increasing is never

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:34.769
going to stop, so the other n point of the range is infinity, with that open

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:35.674
parenthesis.
