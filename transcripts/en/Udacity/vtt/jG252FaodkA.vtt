00:00:00.308 --> 00:00:01.910
So there are lots of different ways you can try to

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.360
measure the bandwidth that you're getting over your Internet connection. I'm

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.575
going to show you one that's provided by CNET. This is not

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:10.940
necessarily that accurate and it'll depend where you are. But you

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.290
can go to the CNET site, Internet Speed Test with hyphens

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.670
between Internet, speed, and test. Pick your location. I'll deal with

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.040
work, and it will try sending some messages to figure out

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.868
what your bandwidth is. And, you can see that I'm getting 44,000

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:29.209
kilobits per second, it says kbps here. So that's

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:32.619
44 megabits per second. We can try again, see

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.390
if we get the same result. And we try it a second time, we get 31 megabits per

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.160
second, or 31.7. We can try again and we get 62. So we can see that it is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.446
varying each time we try it. And bandwidth does

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:51.010
vary. You're sharing connections on the network with other people,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.590
they may be doing different things. There are lots of reasons

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.590
why the bandwidth that you measure varies, but if you try

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.490
this test you'll see what you get. And we're going to have

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.520
a quiz. This is more of a survey than a quiz. But,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.870
we're curious to see what bandwidth you're getting. So, try a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.320
bandwidth test and see what the result is, and the quiz

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.990
will ask you to report that to us. So, this isn't

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.050
really a quiz. It's more of a survey. But the question is,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.050
what is your bandwidth? And you can use one of the tools

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.030
we provided links to, to figure out what your bandwidth is. And

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.150
the boxes give you a choice of ranges. And if you can

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.070
get greater then 200 megabits per second were you live, I'm very jealous.
