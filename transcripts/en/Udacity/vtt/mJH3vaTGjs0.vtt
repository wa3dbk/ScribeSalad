00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.140
Now it's time to look at our
usage data in Analytics.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.791
Remember, to get to
the Analytics dashboard,

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:09.640
you go to analytics.google.com.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.910
Log in, if you need to,
and choose your account.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.300
And the Analytics dashboard
opens at the App Overview page.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.100
But first,
I want to look at the realtime data.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.910
So, go to Real Time and Overview.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.210
Pause the video now while you go to
the Real Time Overview, right now.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.670
When you go to a screen in your app,
a tracking hit is generated.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.470
The Analytics service batches
up tracking requests and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.150
sends them all together
at regular intervals.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.510
I'll talk more about that soon.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.850
The point here is that you might
need to wait a few minutes for

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.550
the data to start
showing up in your app.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.908
The data's going to show up
while there are active users,

00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:52.780
and then when nobody is using your app,
it's going to disappear.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.480
Now let's look at the accumulated data.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.350
To do that, go back to the App Overview.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.200
Get that by clicking here, App Overview.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.910
And the Overview page gives a summary
of all the data for your app.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.360
Notice a default date range up here.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.460
And you'll see that it ends in not
today's date, but yesterday's date.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.890
So this is April the 6th,
today's actually April the 7th.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.170
So, since we want to see
the data that we got for

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.840
today while we're testing,
we need to change the date range.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.680
So you click on it, you choose
the start date and the end date.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.620
And I recommend while you're
the only one using the app and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.610
working through the course, just set
the date range to just be today.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.600
So go to today, whichever that is.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.530
For me, that's 7th of April.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.420
Set the start date, and then the end
date will automatically be today,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.670
because you can't go beyond today.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.570
And you apply the date range.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:48.760
And don't worry if you
don't see any data yet.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.110
It might take a while for
the data to show up.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.930
While we're waiting for

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.020
the data to arrive,
I'm going to talk a bit about sessions.
