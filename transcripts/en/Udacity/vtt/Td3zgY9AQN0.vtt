00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.208
I was 12 years old when I got 
my first modem,

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:06.436
a 1200 baud ACE compatible,
and starting getting online.

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:10.125
And not the internet online, 
local BBSs.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.572
At around the same time, 
yuppies were sporting

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:15.890
the first brick-sized mobile phones 
as the first GSM network

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.555
started rolling out.

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:22.470
Fast forward less than 17 years to 2007, 
and the iPhone launches,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.140
followed less than a year by Android. 
And almost overnight,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.590
we've come to expect the world's 
information in the palm of our hands.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.770
Just six years after the first 
Android phone launched,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.680
it's powering everything from phones,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.868
to tablet's, watches, TVs and cars.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:39.056
So where do we go next?

00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:41.245
The most obvious answer 
is enabling the same

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.723
handheld cloud connecting 
computing platform

00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:46.201
to the next 5 billion people.

00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:48.680
As hardware becomes cheaper 
and more powerful,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.820
more of the world's 
population will be able

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.960
to get internet-connected computers.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.790
And the smartphone is going 
to be what makes it possible

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.700
To facilitate this, we're seeing 
new approaches to getting online,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.320
mesh networks, white spaces, 
or even Google's Project Loon.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.260
We'll hopefully soon see ubiquitous 
world-wide internet connectivity

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.570
become a reality.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.450
At the same time, smartphones
will start to disappear.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.750
In the same way that we don't think 
of computers as computers

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.360
once they become part of our dishwashers, 
cars, or TVs, we'll stop thinking

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.990
of mobiles as such when they disappear 
into our watches and white goods.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.980
We'll come to expect that anything that

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.560
can be improved through the incorporation 
of a wireless internet connection

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.820
will simply have one. 
For that to happen,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.930
we need to find more creative ways 
to interact with computers

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140
than using mice, keyboards,
and touch screens.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.860
I can already pick up my phone 
or lift my wrist, address Google,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.660
and perform searches, send texts or email,
set alarms, or take notes

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.470
without having to touch 
a screen or keyboard.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.970
Screens themselves have become 
so sharp that their pixel densities

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.570
aren't perceptible to the human eye.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.150
And the team at Google X 
are building contact lenses

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.760
capable of measuring blood sugar levels. 
Speaking of senses,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.750
not only can I control my phone 
by putting it either face up

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.170
or face down, it has a battery 
of sensors similar

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.660
to an aegis class warship.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.960
Light meters, temperature gauges, 
barometers, gyroscopes,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.640
all of which can be used to 
replace text entry or automate processes.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.823
Wearables, cars, and thermostats 
introduce even more possibilities

00:02:17.823 --> 00:02:19.036
of sensors.

00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:22.340
Connect all of that to the cloud, 
and the possibilities are endless.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.420
Future of Android isn't 
a more powerful phone operating system.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.410
It is the brains behind invisible,
ubiquitous, cloud connected computing.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.800
So the skills we learn today 
to build cool apps

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.810
are the same skills we'll use tomorrow

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.270
to control everything around us.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.732
We've taken the first step 
into that future.

00:02:40.732 --> 00:02:43.682
I can't wait to see what you do next.
