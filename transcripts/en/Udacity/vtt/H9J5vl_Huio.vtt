One of the other big architecture pieces 
we've added to help us scale

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
was this notion of a precomputed cache.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.323
We found ourselves running these queries 
to generate the hot page

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:09.000
for Reddit over and over and over again.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You may cache it for a minute but then once that 
minute expired we had to recalculate it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We had a job--a kind of job that would 
run and just compute it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then put the stored value in memcached--
that worked okay

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but then we had to do it, we 
had all of our users pages.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Every user had their own listings of 
things they've submitted and liked

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.692
and their top things, and every Reddit had a new 
page and a hot page and a bunch of different sorts

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:30.000
So we stared precomputing everything.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The way we did that is that we have 
this whole other database stack.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
These are the replicas of the link database--basically, 
more link databases.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
They could lag a little bit. It wasn't a big deal.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Every time a vote would come in, we put in this queue--queue is just a list of things to be done--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we have this machine that basically 
manages huge list of things,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and we had a couple of other machines 
that we called the precompute servers.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What these things would do is they take jobs 
off the queue. This link has been voted on.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.415
Actually, what the apps would do is 
when a link was voted on,

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:58.000
they would add a number of jobs to the queue.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The jobs might be to recompute Reddit's front page, 
recompute this user's liked page,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
recompute this user's top page, 
recompute Reddit's top page.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There are all sorts of different listings 
that are affected by a particular vote.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
These machines would pull off these jobs

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and then they would run those 
queries against the database.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They would just mercilessly as fast as 
they could take a job off the queue

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
run the query against these databases.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
These databases were really, really hot 
and had no real-time requests.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
No request from the Internet actually ever 
touched these precompute machines.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's only these guys, these precompute servers would 
touch these preocompute databases.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
When the job was done running, we would take 
the results and store them to memcached.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That way almost every page you looked at on Reddit 
would be fetched out from memcached.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There are very few things you could do on Reddit that would actually directly manipulate a database.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Once we got to that point of scaling, 
things got a lot easier.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
These are really just kind of the last resort 
primary sources of data,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but any data you can access on Reddit in real time 
is actually served out of memcache.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Every single listing is precomputed and stored in memcached for Reddit on the whole site.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This is the reason why now you can't go back beyond

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
about a thousand links on any particular listing.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It used to be, you can go to Reddit's front page and 
hit next, next, next, next, next

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and then go all the way back to the beginning of time, 
which will just really, really trounce

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
our databases, do a lot of damage, slow the site down, 
etc, etc--you can't do that anymore.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We only store the top thousand for each sort, 
which is one of the limitations of doing this

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
precompute thing, but on the upside 
the cycle is very, very fast.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
There are very few legitimate reasons to go all the way back to the beginning of time on Reddit anyway.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This worked out really nicely, and the site to this day 
still has this general structure,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
although a lot of the technologies have changed, and 
that's what we're going to talk to Neil about.
