00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.340
You can use Google Analytics
to answer questions like

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.790
how do users download my app?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.700
So over here in the dashboard
you see the Acquisition menu,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.810
expand it, New Users.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.260
We see the new users for

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.260
the time period, and we can scroll
down to see their locations.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.140
How the App Marketplace shows
where users downloaded your app.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.627
And you can get a day-by-day breakdown.

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:32.159
So com.androidvending is the Play Store,
so

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.040
here we see that most of the downloads
came from the Play Store.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.088
And then you can scroll down this
page to get the accumulated data.

00:00:42.088 --> 00:00:45.577
So the Sources reports
provide different but

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:51.030
similar views of the same data,
showing where users got your app.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.090
So the All shows all
the places they got the app.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.290
Google Play shows the sessions
where the users downloaded the app

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.950
from Google Play.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.080
And iTunes will show a similar thing for
iTunes.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.870
We can look at the Google Play Referral
report to see workflow representation

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.340
of where people came from to get to
the Play store to install the app.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.770
So, Google organic.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.300
We see here we had 111 Play Store Views,
which resulted in 60 installs.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.770
So to be able to get reports like this,
you need to do a couple of things.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.840
So the app must be in Google Play,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.689
or also, on iTunes, you can track
conversion tracking from iTunes.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.320
You need to link your Google Analytics
account to Google Play.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.580
So, to link your Analytics
account to Google Play,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.470
go to the Google Play
page in the dashboard.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.410
And you see this information
telling you that report requires

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.870
that you link your app
to the Google Play.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.940
And you can just go ahead right from
here and click Set up app linking.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.660
Enter all the data.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.670
And right here,
Get Google Play Developer Console Data.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.840
And if you're doing iOS
Campaign Tracking you would also

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.610
enable that one there.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.949
And you save that.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.650
And now your Google Analytics
account is linked to Google Play for

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.620
this account ID.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.390
The steps for linking to iTunes
are outlined in the dashboard, too.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.440
So you can go through those steps
here if applicable to your app.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.200
And don't forget to add the code to
your app to send the download hits.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.720
Oops, my bad.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.920
No code needed for

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.870
Android Apps and
that's all there is to it.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.260
Now you'll be able to use Google
Analytics to track how people download

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.460
your app from the Play Store.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.510
This course doesn't cover
deploying apps to Google Play, so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.090
I'll leave you to investigate this
aspect of Analytics on your own.
