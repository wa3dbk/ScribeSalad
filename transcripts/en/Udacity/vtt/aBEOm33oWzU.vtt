00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.190
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.620
Well actually, we're done.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.890
It's been kind of a long road, but
we just covered a bunch of material.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.333
I apologize if I talk too much.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.375
I do that and
my kids tell me that all the time.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:15.976
But i think you got a bunch of good
grounding on the fundamentals of

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.430
Computer Vision.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.310
We manipulated images as functions,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.490
everything from frequency content
to talking about filtering.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.230
We talked about how cameras and camera
models work that allow you to reason

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.910
about the geometry
between multiple views.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.780
We talked about finding features in one
image, and how you would find them in

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.960
another image, so
that you could relate them, either for

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.640
doing image manipulation, doing for
recognition, or just doing the geometry.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.260
We talked a little bit about image
formation, in terms of how light

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.200
interplays with material in order
to make a picture to begin with.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.860
We talked about how in video
images change and, and

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.250
the motion happens in doing tracking.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.300
Then towards the end, we focused a bit
more on recognition, classification.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.630
And we talked about how to do sort
of more serious work in that area,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.450
you would have to know more
about machine learning.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.500
And in fact, that's a good
sort of jumping off point for

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.070
where you might go from here.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.910
If you actually wanted to do some
high-end work in computer vision

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.610
involving recognition,
classification, labelling,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.340
you probably would have to get well
grounded in machine learning methods.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.970
At least, grounded enough that you
could understand the methods that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.800
are currently being applied.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.090
There's another side, in fact,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.130
one of the other Udacity Georgia Tech
courses on computational photography,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.260
which thinks about the manipulation of
images with respect to creating new

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.570
images, or thinking about it sort
of an advanced media perspective.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.930
And in particular, even though this
feels like a somewhat comprehensive

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.870
course in computer vision, if you were
to sort of go out there and you know,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.610
try to do work in
a computer vision world,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.050
there are some things you'll
see that you didn't see.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.660
We were very, shall we say, careful in
many of the images that we gave you.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.208
Images are much less well-behaved
than the images that we gave you.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.634
And one of the first things
you find out is that wow,

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:59.737
I wasn't getting the types of
images that I was expecting, and so

00:01:59.737 --> 00:02:03.008
you have to think a lot more about how
you get the images to be the way you

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:06.620
want them to be, and
then in order to do the computer vision.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.710
The flip side is consuming the
information that comes out of computer

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.538
vision, all right?

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:13.640
Is that going to go into some system
that's going to do more reasoning

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.640
about the nature of what's going on?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.792
Are you going to set off alarms?

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:17.583
Are you going to mark things?

00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:18.910
Are you going to go shopping?

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.480
What's going to be the output,
how's that output going to be used?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.030
So, I'm sure at this point,
you feel like you've learned some stuff.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.190
There is a lot more to do, but

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.500
a lot of what needs to be done is really
the applications of these basic skills,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.990
to sort of the specific set of
imagery that you're working with.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.510
So, I hope you will do some of that.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.060
If you do and it works well,
please send us a note.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.050
I love it when I hear
students come back and say,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.280
you know,
I I thought your class was okay.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.350
It's kind of a lot of work.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.670
But man, am I glad I took it,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.290
because I'm now doing this sort of
imagery analysis of aerial imagery, and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.050
all of a sudden I find myself
using stuff that we learned.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.650
So if you have any of those experiences,
please share them with us, with me.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.150
And we look forward to
talking to you again.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.650
Bye.
