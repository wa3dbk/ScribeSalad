00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.500
All five of the personalty dimensions exist on a continuum. Meaning just like

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.658
with intelligence, if you plot the entire population, you'll only get a few

00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:15.622
people at the extreme highs or the extreme lows of each dimension. But most

00:00:15.622 --> 00:00:20.742
people would end up here, in the middle. If we plotted the frequency of the

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:26.625
entire population, we would get a bell shape curve or normal distribution. So

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:31.855
most of us, about 68% of us, would score around the mean. But then we'll see

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:35.755
that around 2% of people are either really high or really low in any given

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:40.509
dimension. What this also shows us is that there's a high and the low in to all

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:46.820
the personalities dimensions. For example, let's look at extroversion. On the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.600
high end we have, well extroversion, and on the low end we have introversion.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.276
And now, look at agreeableness. On the high end we have, well, agreeableness

00:00:56.276 --> 00:01:01.465
and on the low end we have hostility or coldness. So, as you can see, the big

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:05.560
five uses the high end as the labels, but there are still two sides to things,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.630
the highs and the lows.
