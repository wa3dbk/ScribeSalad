00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.080
The three places that I implemented this change were 1,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.950
the index.html file where the template was.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.687
2, To do view.js.

00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:16.820
And lastly, todo.js, the place where we store all of our data in our model.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.430
So I had to figure this one out too.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.540
So, here's the thought processes I went through.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.660
So first off, I knew I needed to add a priority button

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.180
in the same place as the other button, our Delete button and our Edit button.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.070
So I had to remember where that was.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.502
Sure enough, it was in our template code in our item template in

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.830
our index.HTML file.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.570
So I'm going to go ahead and copy the Edit button, and I'm going to paste it,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.450
and I'm give it a class of priority button.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.920
Before I do anything else, I'm going to go ahead and test this.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340
Sure enough, in the browser, it works just fine.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.420
When you roll over it, there's a little exclamation point,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.150
and when you click on it, nothing really happens.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.220
Of course, that's not unexpected; we haven't wired it up yet.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.610
So, now we have to remember where did we wire up those other buttons?

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.858
That's right, it was in our Todoview.js.

00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:09.500
If I scroll down just a teeny bit, it was in this events object literal.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.270
I can put it anywhere I want in this entire object literal, but

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120
I'll go ahead and put it right here.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.670
So what's the event?

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.380
The event is going to be a click because when I click on the priority button,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.730
I want something to happen.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.695
How do I get to the button?

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:26.850
.priority button, and what's the functionality?

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.640
Well, gosh, I do not know, actually.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.030
There's no function down here, that toggles the priority of a button, and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.400
that's of course because it's a new feature that we're creating.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.540
So it's up to us to define this.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.350
What's something that looks similar?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.280
Well, we're toggling the priority of a button,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.260
it turns out we already have a function called toggle completed.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.380
Let's take a moment and look and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.440
see what that looks like, and that's just down below here.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.340
Toggle completed is a function,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.710
which says this .model the thing that we clicked on's model .toggle.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.280
So, because we're on this wild goose chase we have to go and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.680
see what that looks like.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.020
Now where are we going to find a toggle method on a model?

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.160
My guess is it would be on the to do model, in to do.js.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.600
So, sure enough, our to do dot JS file is not very big.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.590
It's just got this defaults thing and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.900
this toggle thing, and the toggle thing is exactly what we're looking for.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.850
It toggles the completed state of the to do item.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.500
How does it do that?

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.680
It says this dot save, completed is not this.get completed.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.100
Now, this is the kind of stuff that we don't necessarily know because we

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.770
don't know Backbone very well, and it would be great to take a look and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.860
see what this.save does and how it works, and this.get and how it works.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.430
So if I were you, I would go ahead and look them up.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.250
I'm not going to look them up in this solution video, but, suffice it to say,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.620
this dot save takes in a property here with a value and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.510
the value gets saved to the model.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.280
So, this dot save completed changes the completed value of our Todo.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.160
And what does it set it to?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.910
It sets it to not this dot get completed.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.180
So, if this dot get completed returns true we're setting it to false.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.250
If it returns false we're setting it to not false, or true.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.500
This is just basically a toggle, which is exactly why it's called toggle.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.110
If completed is true it sets it to false and if it's false it sets it to

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.470
true and that's exactly how we want our priority thing to work.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.210
So for now I'm going to go ahead and do a very similar kind of a thing here.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.540
I've got toggle, and

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.290
I'm also going to make a new thing that toggles the priority.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.680
So, I've gotten this far.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.520
What do I want to save it as?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.650
I'll say priority.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.860
Priority is going to be the opposite of this.get('priority').

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.540
Now, if I poke around the documentation for backbone models I'll also

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.630
find information on this guy right here, that's the defaults.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.660
When you make a new to do, what are its defaults?

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.220
It has a title of nothing, it has a completed value of false, and

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.709
I also should add something for the priority.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.130
I'll say priority is false.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.750
Now I have something called togglePriority on our Backbone Model.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.320
So now when I create to do items they don't just have a completed state of

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.060
false, they now always have a priority of false.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.680
And they also have a function to toggle the priority.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.700
And that's exactly what we want to make use of over here in our view.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.802
So instead of toggle completed function this.model.toggle.

00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:51.120
I'm going to do the exact same thing but with toggle priority.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.650
I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.910
save this, now one thing you'll notice is I'm being tofu even in my comment.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.100
Toggle the "priority", and you'll notice I wrote this exactly the same way

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.050
because in this case, the tildes on either side are saying this is code,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.470
and then the quotes are saying we're talking about a string.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.050
Same with editing down here in this comment, and so,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.220
of course, my comment is going to look exactly the same.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.780
I am missing a comma here, I'd better not leave that off.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.560
If I did leave that off, you'll find errors in the console,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.820
which is always a good place to check when your application doesn't work, and

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.260
it would say, hey, something's wrong here around line 73.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.270
All right, so now I've got a toggle priority.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.900
I've got a toggle priority on the model, which I'm using right here.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.950
And let's go ahead and save it all, and

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.610
refresh, sure enough, it does not work because I haven't finished wiring it up.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.730
The thing I forgot was here in events.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.623
I'm saying when I click on the priority button what happens?

00:05:54.623 --> 00:05:56.060
Nothing yet.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.580
I need to say toggle priority.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.320
That's the name of the function or

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.440
the method on the view down here that I just made.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.390
And that will toggle the priority of whatever elements we're talking about.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.510
Whatever to-do we're talking about.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.940
Now if I go and I refresh and I click, still nothing's quite working.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.460
Now why would that be?

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.940
I'm setting a priority state on the model anytime I click on the button.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.560
So, either I did something wrong before, or I'm doing it all right,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.590
but I'm just not seeing it.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.370
As it turns out, the thing that I forgot is I forgot to actually show it here.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.420
That would go over here, in index that HTML.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.910
Remember that the CSS was written that way you would add a class

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.800
of priority on the LI.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.060
So where in this LI template do we see the actual LI?

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.580
Hm.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.260
Well, if we look around, we don't see it.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.290
It's kind of of a problem, huh?

00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:00.530
So, maybe this wasn't the right place to look, for how to add the LI.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.070
So we've got the template, what else is responsible for rendering the elements?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.880
Let's take a look at the view, again.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.890
Our to do view, again.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.180
Once again, we're on this wild goose chase and we have to be a detective.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.590
Now once again, I also want to remind you that this is just my process,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.060
this is how I would go about trying to figure this out

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.920
assuming that I hadn't done this before and I didn't know backbone.js.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.800
If I had to work on this code base for months, I would learn Backbone.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.960
But until then, being a detective can be useful.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.690
So we've got our events thing, and that's for the actual click.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.190
How is it rendered, again?

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.510
Let's scroll down and see if we can find anything interesting.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.700
Well, here is render, that seems like exactly the kind of

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.380
function we'd be looking for, so let's see what happens.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.140
There's this code here, we're going to ignore it because if you read this

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.680
comment, this is just for fixing a little bit of a backbone local storage bug.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.690
So this isn't really interesting to the functionality of the application.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.080
This is the meat of it.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.850
It looks like it's taking this element, the actual elements behind this, the LI.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.570
And it's setting the HTML to, the rendered template.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.930
It's also telling this element to toggle, to turn on or

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.740
off the class if completed whenever this is true or false.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.040
Now it's also, wait, wait a second, wait a second.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.360
Toggle class.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.220
That seems like something we might want to do.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.160
So, what is this line doing again?

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.510
It's setting a class of completed.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.080
If this.model.get completed is true.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.490
Hm, so, if this model says that

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.660
it's been a completed event, it adds a class of completed.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.920
We want to do exactly that, but for our priority button Eureka.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.690
So, let's see if this works, this.$el.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.820
So that's the element itself .toggleClass priority, and it'll set that class of

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:06.850
priority on, or enable it, if this .model.get of priority is true.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.930
Now let's see if that works.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.270
Let's hop back into our browser and try this one more time.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.015
I'm going to uncheck these, and if we hit the exclamation mark,

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:21.130
sure enough, eureka, it works.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.070
Now we can prioritize some of these.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.850
We'll say add a new feature's really important.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.570
And then as I check them off,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.540
the priority red goes away, and here's our add a new feature.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.580
Pat yourself on the back, we just added this feature.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.890
And especially pat yourself on the back if you came to this kind of

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.970
a solution on your own, without looking at the solution video.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.050
Awesome work.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:49.220
Now, if you did it, I would recommend, even though you know the solution now,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:54.720
going back and trying to do this by yourself, without referencing my solution.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.410
Do remember that the whole point is for you to be able to do this on your own.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.880
To be a detective on your own, and to implement functionality like tofu.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.010
So your code looks like it's always been there.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:07.510
Good work.
