00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.390
Now we just looked at how to use the insert command

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.260
from the PyMongo client in order to get documents into our

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.990
MongoDB database. A better way to do this in my opinion,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.570
is to output all of our documents as a Json file.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.960
And that's what I did here. So, instead of

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.630
our Python cleaning program, actually putting data into MongoDB directly.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.260
We simply separate the two concerns, the task of

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.830
cleaning the data from the task of getting it into

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.530
mongoDB. And the intermediary we use is a file

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.420
that has one Json document per line. Now we can

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.150
bulk import this data into mongoDB using the mongo import

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.140
system command. I'll show you a very common use for

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.270
mongo import here. See the instructor notes for

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.600
the link to the mongo import documentation. Okay, mongoimport

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.400
has a number of command-line parameters associated with

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.415
it, and we can see those by typing --help.

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:57.995
Okay, other way to get documentation on mongoimport.

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:00.700
Okay, so let's use mongoimport to get our auto's

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.010
data into a collection. First, I'm going to

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.210
specify the database, and we'll continue using the examples

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.960
database that we've been using all along. And then I'm going

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
to specify the collection into which this data should be stored. In

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.530
this case I'm going to store it in another collection, myautos2. And then

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.880
finally, I need to specify the file that I actually want to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.725
import. That file is in the same directory, and it's called

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:27.600
autos.json. Now if I run this, we get an, a nice output

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.500
message telling us that we imported those same documents we saw before

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.390
when we were using the Insert command in order to get data

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.210
into MongoDB. So now we've looked at two different

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.900
ways to get data into MongoDB. And there are others.
