00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:08.400
written above. So what is s cubed minus 4 x squared minus the quantity x cubed

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.330
minus 2 x squared. Please write your answer down here. Note that setting up the

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.650
problem this way, makes subtraction very easy, since like terms are lined up.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.390
