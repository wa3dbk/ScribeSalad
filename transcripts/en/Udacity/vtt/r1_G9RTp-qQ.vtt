00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.760
How do we evaluate
an intrusion detection system?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.640
We typically use accuracy metrics
to measure the detection algorithm.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.110
We use detection rate or

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.410
true positive rate to measure how
well an IDS can detect intrusions.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.290
That is,
given that there is an intrusion,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.200
how likely would the IDS
correctly output an alert?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.910
We can also use force negative rate.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.530
That is how many intrusions did we miss?

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.980
Another aspect of detection
accuracy is the false alarm rate.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.740
That is,
given that there's no intrusion,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.680
how likely is the IDS is going
to falsely output an alert?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.190
We can also use true negative rate.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.240
That is, how likely normal activities
are currently classified as normal?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.710
And if you are a sysadmin,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.100
you may want to know about
the Bayesian detection rate of an IDS.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.120
That is, given that the IDS
has already produced an alert.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.730
How likely is it that an intrusion
actually occurs in your network?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.380
We can more formally
summarize these metrics.

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:11.500
Here, we use A to represent alarm or
positive.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.810
I to represent intrusion.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.610
Detection rate or true positive
rate is the probability that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.870
given there's an intrusion, how
likely the IDS will produce an alert.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.570
And false negative rate is
1 minus true positive rate.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.910
False alarm rate is the probability
that, given that there's no intrusion.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.300
Not I, meaning it's normal.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.100
How likely an IDS would
incorrectly output an alert?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.090
And true negative rate is
1 minus false alarm rate.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.940
Bayesian detection rate
is the probability that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.970
given there's an IDS alert,
how likely there's likely an intrusion.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.450
In addition to the detection algorithms,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.940
you can also evaluate IDS in terms
of it's system architecture.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.560
We want the IDS to be scalable.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.900
Meaning that,
it can function at high speed networks.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.380
We also want the IDS to
be resilient to attacks.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.000
Meaning that, it is not easily disabled
by attacks that target the IDS.
