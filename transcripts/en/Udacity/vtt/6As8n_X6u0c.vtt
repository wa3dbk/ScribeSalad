00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.340
Tables can be tricky.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.790
If they're more than a few columns,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.970
there's a pretty good chance that it's
going to overflow the viewport on

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.130
smaller screens,
forcing horizontal scrolling.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.180
Yuck, To fix this,
there's several options, and

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.570
I'm going to show you three.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.580
Hidden columns, a technique called no
more tables, and contained tables.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.140
Like break points, you want to
experiment to decide what works best for

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.760
your content, and remember,
different content might call for

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.640
different answers.
