00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.568
The first thing you had to do which you probably did, is find the average of x

00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:11.796
and y. 5 plus 6 plus 1 plus negative 4 divided by 4 is 2. 3 plus 7 plus 8

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:18.212
divided by 3 is 6. So we have our means. And here are our deviations. Here are

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:25.480
our squared deviations. Then when we sum them up, we get 62 and 14.
