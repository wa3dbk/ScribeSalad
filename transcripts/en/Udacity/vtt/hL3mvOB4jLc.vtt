00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.977
So here, I've drawn the graph for you of the equation we were just working with,

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:07.943
y equals x squared plus 5 x plus 4. Now, of course, this is in standard form and

00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:11.937
we put it in vertex form earlier, so I could have written it that way as well.

00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:16.131
We have all our important points that we've picked out, labeled. But there's one

00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:20.037
more thing about the graph that we can talk about and this is actually super

00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:24.330
important. Notice that this and all other parabolas are symmetrical. There's a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.236
vertical line running right through the vertex that divides this parabola

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:32.325
exactly in half. What I want you to know is what the equation of this vertical

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:32.825
line is.
