00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.650
Overlay Networks is a general principle and at

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.600
the OS level we already have an overlay network.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.050
There is the IP Network which is really

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.540
an overlay on top of the local area network.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.620
You may have a particular IP address for

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.330
your laptop. That IP address actually translates to a

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.730
Mac address. Because the Mac address is the real

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.380
address that is used by the physical network in

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.520
the local area network to communicate with other buddies

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.335
on the same local area network. So at the

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:36.177
OS level, when you send a message using TCP/IP,

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:40.000
that message, it will be delivered to your buddy who

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.740
happens to be on the same local area network.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.360
It is actually getting converted to a Mac address so

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.270
that it can traverse the local area network and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.780
get to the desired destination. So that it can traverse

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.820
the local area network and get to the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.890
desired destination. Similarily, CDN, a content distribution network is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.438
an overlay on top of TCP/IP. So in particular, In the case of CDN, we have this

00:01:05.438 --> 00:01:08.302
node ID. There is some manufactured ID at

00:01:08.302 --> 00:01:11.342
the application level, but that maps to an IP

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:14.862
address, and that is how at the application level,

00:01:14.862 --> 00:01:17.022
when I say I want to send a message

00:01:17.022 --> 00:01:22.462
to Node number 60, at the application level, I can convert that Node ID 60 to

00:01:22.462 --> 00:01:25.220
an IP address. To which I can send

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.660
it and eventually the message will get delivered.
