00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.313
The answer is we have more transistors available for computation.

00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:05.444
We're not clocking things any faster.

00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:07.064
Clock rates are remaining constant.

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:10.616
The reason we're getting faster is that we get more and more transistors

00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:13.851
available on a processor die with every generation.
