explanations of personality is that environmental influence of our family is

00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:13.157
extremely low. It's almost all from non-shared environments and from our

00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:17.951
non-family. Our non-family accounts for about 40% of our personality on

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.170
average.
