00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.200
Let's talk about permissions, when each app APK is installed,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.290
it's given it's own unique Linux user ID. And each

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.175
app runs within its instance in the Android Virtual machine.

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:16.946
[SOUND] As a result each app is completely sand boxed.

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:19.831
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:23.051
Its files processes and other resources are inaccessible

00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.110
to other apps. This sandboxing approach is used to

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.210
ensure that by default no app can access sensitive

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.250
data or perform actions that could adversely impact other

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.210
apps, the OS, or users. Things like accessing the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.320
internet, getting the user's location, or reading or modifying

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.660
the contacts database. Rather than asking the user each

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
time an app tries to access something sensitive you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.720
declared permissions that your app requires in it's manifest.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.130
You can get a list of all of the permission

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.090
your app may require here at the Android developer site.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.390
So, why not just ask for all the permissions and

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.320
never worry about it again? Well, when users install

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.200
your app their greeted with this dialogue which lists all

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.645
of the permissions that you've requested along with the more

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:10.770
user-friendly descriptions. Nothing says this app was built by hackers

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.380
who want to steal my data, rob my house, clear out my

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.560
bank account, and take and share nude pictures of me like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.250
a weather app that wants access to every permission on the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.100
device. Best practice is to request the absolute minimum of permissions.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.340
Every time you need to request a new permission, take it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.390
as a flag to stop and consider if there are other

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.970
alternatives that might achieve the same goal. For example, using an

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.140
intent to launch the camera app, rather than accessing the camera, directly.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.550
Later, we'll look at ways to share your data with

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.370
other apps, using intents and content providers to create bridges

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.630
between these apps sandboxs. You can declare and use those

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.040
permissions in these instances to

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.080
similarly restrict access to sensitive information.
