00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.408
Let's do a quiz to see if
we understood locality.

00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:07.270
Which of these are not
good examples of locality?

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.720
It rained three times already today, so

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.510
we can conclude that it is
likely to rain again today.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.440
We ate dinner at six
every day last week, so

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.200
we can conclude that probably we will
eat dinner around six this week, too.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.940
And, it was New Year's Eve yesterday,
so we conclude that probably,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.549
it will be New Year's Eve today, too.

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:33.750
Again, you need to find which of these
are not good examples of locality.
