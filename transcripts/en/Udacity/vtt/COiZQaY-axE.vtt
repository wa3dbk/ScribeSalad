00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.250
Just to give you a simple answer,
the Mahalanobis distance is ideal for

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.690
samples drawn from
identical distributions.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.390
It is useful to use more advanced
clustering techniques like k-means or

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.370
others to find outliers
in multidimensional data.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.800
Ideally we should inspect all
variables that are uncorrelated

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.790
to find true outliers
in the entire dataset.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.630
However, if you want to explore
more advanced techniques,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.210
discuss it in the forum and
try them out on your own.
