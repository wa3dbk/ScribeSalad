00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.770
This is a big question in psychology. What is intelligence? Some people might

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.728
channel Justice Stewart of the United States Supreme Court. And say, well, I

00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:11.796
know it when I see it, as he did when he was trying to define obscenity and

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:16.950
pornography. But psychologists have come up with a basic answer. Intelligence

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.465
consists of a set of cognitive skills or abilities. Including abstract thinking

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:26.556
and reasoning, problem solving, the ability to understand complex ideas. The

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:30.651
ability to acquire knowledge, and the ability to learn from experience and

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:36.960
adapt to a changing environment. Other less agreed upon intelligent components

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.630
are memory, working memory, spatial ability and mathematical ability. So, how

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.937
can scientists disagree about the theory of intelligence? Well, let's go to

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:49.209
Greg and can tell us a little more about that.
