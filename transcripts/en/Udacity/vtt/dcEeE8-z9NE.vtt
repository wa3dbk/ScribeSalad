00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Do you know that the acceleration equals (2π)² r/T²,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but on the other hand we have Newton's law telling us that this acceleration is G*mE/r².

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This yields the following. Multiply both sides by r² , (2π)²r/T²=G*mE/r².

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's take r² over here, T² over here, (2π)² over here, so we have,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:04.000
if r³ is whatever remains on the right hand side, r itself is the ³ √ GmET²/(2π)²

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and if you plug in the numbers, that's about 42,000 km,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which is the same as the length of the equator of the earth.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So this spacecraft, the distance between the spacecraft and the center of the earth

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
has to be almost the same as the length of the equator of the circumference of the earth.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Remember that the distance between that spacecraft and the center of the earth

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is not the height of that spacecraft.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
To get the height, you would have to subtract the radius of the earth.
