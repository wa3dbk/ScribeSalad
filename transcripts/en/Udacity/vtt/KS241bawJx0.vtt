00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's go back to our list of concepts and say what have we done so far and what's next?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We think we did a good job with the dictionary,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we did a good job with our hands here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In terms of legal play, well, we've got words, so we're sort of part way there,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but we haven't hooked up the words to the board.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Maybe that's the next thing to do--is say, let's do a better job of hooking up

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the letters and the hand with the words in the dictionary

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and placing them in the right place on the board.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I don't want to have to deal with the whole board. Let's just deal with one letter at a time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's say there is one letter on the board,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I have my hand and I want to say I can play W-O-R and make up a word.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Just to make it a little bit more satisfying than one letter,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
let's say that there is a set of possible letters that are already on the board,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and we can place our words anywhere,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but we're not going to worry about placing some letters here and having them run off the board.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We're not going to worry about placing letters here and having them run into another letter.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We're just going to say what words can I make out of my hand that connect

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
with either a D or an X or an L.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I need a strategy for that. Let's just consider one letter at a time.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What I need to find is all the plays that take letters in my hand--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[HANDSIE] let's say those are the seven letters in my hand.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Take those letters and combine them with a D and find all the words.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What can those words consist of?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They can have some prefix here, which can be any prefix in our set of prefixes

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that come solely from the letters in my hand.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Then the letter D that's already there doesn't have to come from my hand.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then some more letters.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'll think of this as a prefix plus a suffix where I make sure that I know that D is already there.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Here is word-plays--takes a hand and a set of letters that are on the board,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and it's going t o find all possible words that can be made from that hand,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
connecting to exactly one of the letters on the board.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We're going break it up into a prefix that comes only from the hand,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
then the letter from the board, and then the remainder of the suffix that comes from the hand.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The same structure as we had before--we start off with an empty set of result words.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In the end we're going to return that set of result words.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Then we're going to go through all the possible prefixes that come exclusively from the hand,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
then the possible letters on the board, and add a suffix to the prefix plus the letter on the board

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
from the letters in the hand except for we can no longer use the letters in the prefix.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Find_prefixes is just like find_words except we're collecting things that are in the prefixes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
rather than things that are in the list of words.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now I want you to write add_suffixes.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Given a hand, a prefix that we found before, results set that you want to put things into,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
find me all the words that can be made by adding on letters from the hand

00:03:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
into the prefix to create words.
