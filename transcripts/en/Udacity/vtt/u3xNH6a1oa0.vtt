00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
So we're trying to show that any Boolean formula

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.280
can be transformed into a graph

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.700
such that this graph has a large clique

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.120
in that case only if the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.730
and here's one fact that's going to make our life a little bit easier:

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.210
Every Boolean formula can be written like this,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.840
so you the brackets around variables that are

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.610
only combined by or,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.370
so you have variable 1 or variable 2 or variable 3,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.730
and you can have more than 3 variables in here,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.740
but you have nothing else;

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.540
you only have variables and or

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.130
and between the brackets, you always have an and,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.760
so you have brackets of or and bracket of or and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.450
so on.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.500
This is known as the conjunctive normal form

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.100
of a Boolean formula, and it can be shown that you can write any Boolean formula,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.610
no matter how complex in this form here,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.330
and it will not significantly change the size of the formula,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.830
so if you have n variables and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.140
your Boolean formula has size polynomial in n,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.620
it will stay that way if you to transform it into the conjunctive normal form,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.450
and if you have conjunctive normal form,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.090
then this part here in the brackets

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.400
is known as a clause,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.940
so this here would also be a clause,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.690
and what you can see is the way that this is structured

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.940
the Boolean formula,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.050
if it has a satisfying assignment,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.470
then each of these clauses

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.320
needs to evaluate to true,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.630
because they're all connected by an and,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.330
so if one of these would evaluate to false,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.640
then the whole formula would not be satisfied.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.840
Now how how are we going to transform this into clique?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.860
So I'm just going to show you how to transform a Boolean formula

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.380
that is written in this form

00:01:37.380 --> 99:59:59.000
into a graph, and then we'll discuss what this has to do with clique.
