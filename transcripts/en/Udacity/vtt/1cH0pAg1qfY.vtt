00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.310
In this session, we're going to talk
about operators, symbols like plus and

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.910
minus.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.210
Some of the same symbols you may
have used before in math class.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.960
We're also going to
talk about expressions,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.570
which make use of operators.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.720
Expressions are statements that
can be reduced to a single value.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.079
This session should be a fun one.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:16.950
So let's get started.
