00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.064
Now that we've seen a lot of different types of quadratic equations and how to

00:00:03.064 --> 00:00:06.527
solve them. I want you to choose the best method in each of the following

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:10.926
problems. So, try solving this quadratic equation either by factoring,

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:14.754
completing the square, using the root method or the quadratic formula which we

00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:20.154
just saw. Now here, completing the square would not be the best option. Our a

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:24.776
value is 3 and the b value is odd. For completing the square, we want an a

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:28.754
value of 1 and a b value that's even. So try one of the other methods and see

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:32.534
what you get. For this one, you can enter your answer separated by a comma or

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:36.714
you can use the plus or minus symbol. Good luck.
