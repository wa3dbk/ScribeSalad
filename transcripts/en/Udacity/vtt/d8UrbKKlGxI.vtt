00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Suppose we multiply two Gaussians as in Bayes rule--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a prior and a measurement probability.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The prior has a mean of mu and a variance of sigma-squared.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The measurement has a mean of nu and a covariance of r-squared.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then the new mean, mu prime, is the weighted sum of the old means

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where mu is weighted by r-squared and nu is weighted by sigma-squared

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
normalized by the sum of the weight factors.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The new variance term--I'm going to write sigma-squared prime here

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for the new one after the update--is given by this equation over here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's put this into action.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We have a weighted mean over here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Clearly, the prior Guassian has a much higher uncertainty.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Therefore sigma-squared is larger.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That means that nu is weighted much, much larger than the mu.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So the mean will be closer to the nu than the mu,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which means that it'll be somewhere over here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Interestingly enough, the variance term is unaffected by the actual means.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It just uses the previous variances and comes up with a new one that's even peakier.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The result might look like this.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is the Kalman situation for the measurement update step

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
where this is the prior, this is the measurement probability, and this is the posterior.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Let's practice these equations with a simple quiz.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Here are our equations again.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Suppose I use the following Gaussians:

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
[μ = 10, σ^2 = 4, ν = 12, r^2 = 4]

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
These are Gaussians with equal variance but different means that might look as follows.

00:01:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Compute for me the new mean after the update and the new sigma-squared.
