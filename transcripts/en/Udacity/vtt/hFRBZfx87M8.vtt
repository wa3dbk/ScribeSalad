00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For a house of size 1800 square feet we pay about $126,000.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is this the dot over here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I think you get the story.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In a scatter plot, each data item becomes a point.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We conveniently chose a 2-dimensional list to make for a 2-dimensional scatter plot.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
These are the most popular scatter plots because surfaces like paper are 2-dimensional.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's really hard to do it in like 125 dimensions.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Being as it is, when I draw in all the six data points, I get a scatter plot like this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That's a nice scatter plot, because I can draw a line straight through all of the data points.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now when this happens and there's a relationship that's governed by a straight line,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we call the data linear.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, linearity is a rare concept in statistics.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Very often you'll find deviations, and that's because the size of the house is not

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the only determinant in the cost or perhaps because most of us are bad negotiators.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But when a data set is linear, it's really easy to predict prices of houses in between.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
For example, a house of this size ought to cost this much.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You can read out of a scatter plot the dependence of the size of a house and its price.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Here we are--we're actually looking at the data.

00:01:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We're doing what a statistician ought to do.
