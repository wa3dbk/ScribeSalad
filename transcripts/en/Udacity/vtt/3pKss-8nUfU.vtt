To get rid of our natural log here, we need to use lnx as the input to the

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.470
exponential function with e as the base. So that gives us e to the lnx equals e

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.010
to the 3 4ths. We know the left hand side just simplifies to x and the right

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.885
hand side rounded to three decimal places is 2.117
