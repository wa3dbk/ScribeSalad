00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. So how should we solve it?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My approach is going to be to use a tree.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Or another way to think of this is to use recursion.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's say that we start out with our possible guests remaining to be LM, ECS, and SBA,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the people who've showed up, let's say right now that's 0.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm going to walk through and diagram a tree that shows all 8 possibilities.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Say I start out with 3 guests to invite, and I'm going to pick the first one right now.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
One possibility is that LM shows up; another possibility is that LM does not.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So now I have 2 other worlds to consider.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In this first one, LM has showed up,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and I still have to invite ECS and SBA and see what happens.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Over here no one has showed up, but I still have to invite ECS and SBA.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's work here on the left first. Now it's time to invite ECS.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
One possibility is that she shows up;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
another possibility is that she does not.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But since LM showed up earlier, she's still here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In any event, I still have to invite or consider SBA.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's say I do invite SBA.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
One possibility is that she shows up; another possibility is that she does not.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now I'm out of people to consider inviting, so we're done over here on the left.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Back over here in this possible world, only LM has shown up so far.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Let's go invite SBA.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
One possibility is that SBA shows up; another possibility is that she does not.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And you can see how this pattern would repeat in the other side of the tree.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll just do it here quickly.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And now at the bottom of the tree you can see all 8 of our answers--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8--ranging from everyone shows up to no one shows up.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In this tree, every time we go down a level,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
every time we consider another guest, we have 2 branches.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So the size of the tree doubles each time, which is just what we reasoned about before.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
In this particular running example, my 3 friends that I invited for dinner,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
LM, ECS, and SBA, were Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and Susan B. Anthony, 3 American abolitionists--that is, they opposed slavery--

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
who then went on to champion women's right to vote.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
All right. So how am I going to implement this?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm going to make a recursive procedure that has 2 arguments:

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
1 corresponding to the remaining people to invite

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and another corresponding to who has showed up so far.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Unlike many other recursive procedures,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm going to call myself recursively twice:

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
once in the case where the current person accepts, once in the case where they don't.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So here we are in the interpreter, the integrated development environment.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We're going to write a procedure that accepts a list as an argument

00:02:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and then prints out all the subsets of that list.
