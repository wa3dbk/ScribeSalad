00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.910
So to wrap things up from
the perspective of coco values,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.990
we learned a couple things.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.890
We learned that they're efficiently
computable because we can do it

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.640
with a simple maximization and
a linear program added together.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.580
What we end up getting is a behavior
that's utility maximizing for

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.990
the two players and
then they just split it up afterwards.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.021
You can think of it as actually
decomposing a game into a sum of

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.517
two games,
one of which is purely cooperative and

00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:25.193
one is just purely competitive.

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:27.440
We're just kind of shifting
around the utilities.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.190
But we do it in a way that leaves us
with two really nice games to work with.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.610
The result of that is unique.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.540
There is a unique coco value for
each of the players.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.860
Unlike a Nash where there can be
multiple different possible values

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.530
depending on which Nash you pick,
there's just the one coco value.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.870
It's very convenient.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.140
&gt;&gt; That is convenient,
because that means there's an answer.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.600
&gt;&gt; There is an answer, yeah.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.880
We've discovered that, in fact, you can
generalize this notion, not just to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.770
matrix games like we talked about, but
actually to stochastic games in general.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.106
And we get an algorithm
that we called coco-Q.

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:03.340
Coco-Q is a Q learning like
algorithm that uses coco values

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.890
to learn a strategy in
a stochastic game where

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.430
they actually can make little
side payments after each move.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.990
So the two players move, and
then they divvy some stuff up.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.280
And then they move again, and
they divvy some stuff up.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.720
And those side payments actually end
up being sensitive to issues like,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.120
we just got really unlucky.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.830
Or I'm about to take an action
which is very risky.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.750
And so, you're going to have to
pay me to take that action and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.690
the payments have this nice
interpretations in terms of kind of

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.490
paying people for taking risky actions
and giving them the benefits of things.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.550
It's neat because this actually
converges, this Q learning algorithm

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.930
converges inspite of the fact that the
coco operator is not a non expansion.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.710
We've talked about non expansions in
the context of generalized Q learning.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.670
This is a case where that
analysis actually fails.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.106
But there's a different analysis that
you can use to show that the algorithm

00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:54.693
actually converges so
that was surprising to me anyway.

00:01:54.693 --> 00:01:56.705
I spent a lot of time worrying about
non expansions thinking that they were

00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:58.434
the answer to everything and
they're going to do everything.

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.124
&gt;&gt; They are the answers to
everything except things that are-

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:01.389
&gt;&gt; Just not this thing.

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:02.362
&gt;&gt; Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:05.247
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One thing that's worth
pointing out is that what you get at

00:02:05.247 --> 00:02:08.723
the end of this is not necessarily in
equilibrium, which is to say once we've

00:02:08.723 --> 00:02:11.950
computed what the cocoa values,
are I might not want to play that game.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.460
I might not want to do the side payment.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.371
I would rather get my value in a
national liberal or something like that.

00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:18.440
And so that means that to
really make this work,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.530
this side payment mechanism
has to be binding.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.180
They have to agree in advance that,
whatever happens,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.450
we're going to do what the coco
value says we should do.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.740
And it's somewhat beneficial,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.060
but making this binding agreement
in general is not beneficial.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.380
It could be for some players,
they'd rather just not do it, so

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.440
it's not equilibrium in the same
sense as like Nash and correlated.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.830
&gt;&gt; So we're going to have
to hire police officers?

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.000
&gt;&gt; We're going to have to hire police
officers to divvy up our bananas.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, so just like the real life.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.150
&gt;&gt; So thank you for
letting me have a chance to come in and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.520
discuss cocoa values which otherwise,
we would not and got into.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.194
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess also should I learn
from this the basically we should always

00:02:55.194 --> 00:02:56.448
be doing cocoa or cocoa?

00:02:56.448 --> 00:03:00.151
Yeah, we should always be doing cocoa
and hiring police officers things,

00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:01.480
make things binding.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.750
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.530
I mean in general, you tend to
get a higher sum of values from

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.650
the coco value so paying the police
officers probably makes sense.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.553
So it might be worth hiring them.

00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:14.797
For specific games,
it's not necessarily true and

00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:17.040
it doesn't necessarily kind of fit.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.760
Another problem with the notion
of coco values is that

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.810
it doesn't really generalize if
you've got more than two players.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.157
So this is specific to
the two player setting.

00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:29.654
If you have three players, you can't
split it into, I don't know, three

00:03:29.654 --> 00:03:32.986
matrices one of which is cooperative,
another which is competitive,

00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:35.446
and the other which is I don't know,
combustible.

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:40.320
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,
what if you did all pair-wise games?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.552
You'd have to get extremely lucky.

00:03:41.552 --> 00:03:44.940
&gt;&gt; It doesn't seem like there's a
natural extension of this that works for

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.060
more than two players.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.930
I mean it's an open problem and so
no one's shown that you can't do it.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.090
So that could be a homework problem.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.358
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's cool and
then anyone who get, PhDs for everyone.

00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:58.889
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] PhDs for everyone.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:03:59.597
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:03:59.597 --> 00:04:00.550
&gt;&gt; That would be nice.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.509
Okay so
we've gotten through coco values.

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.939
It's good, so we work together and

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.160
now we've done two solution
concepts in some detail.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Everybody wins.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.109
&gt;&gt; That's the thing and

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.260
now we can actually do side payments
to kind of deviate afterwords.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.690
&gt;&gt; So what are you going to give me?

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.813
&gt;&gt; I'm going to give you
back the pen [SOUND] so

00:04:18.813 --> 00:04:23.554
that you can wrap up the section
three one [LAUGH] of game theory.

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:24.360
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
