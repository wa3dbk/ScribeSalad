00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.400
So, I'm on the Udacity Facebook page.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.780
It's got some interesting stories, looking down there's Sebastian,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.610
there's Jessica.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.220
Oh, there's me.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.800
But what happens when I scroll down even further?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.340
We can see that I've got some room to go, and I can keep scrolling down,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.340
scrolling down, scrolling down.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.210
And, we can tell that this page isn't infinitely long.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.990
But, what happens if I go all the way down to the bottom?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.270
All of a sudden, look,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.820
the scroll bar jumps up, and there's stories where there weren't any before.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.390
Let's do it again.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.000
Oh, and there we go.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.370
We see that stories keep appearing even though this page isn't reloading.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.720
Facebook accomplishes this through the use of Ajax requests.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.550
Let's go ahead and open up dev tools to see what's going on behind the scenes.
