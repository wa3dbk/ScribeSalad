00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.330
So far,
we've been drawing static images.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.500
But in a game, we want things
to be flying all over the place.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.860
To make things move, we need to
know how to keep track of time.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.210
We'll also learn more about
the LibGDX game architecture, and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.320
how we can set up a game that
has multiple different screens.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.960
Finally, we'll learn how to fake
some very basic physics, so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.970
we can make objects move
in a more realistic way.
