00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.370
In particular we're going to focus
on two problems that DAC has.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.070
The first problem is that
although the owner of a resource,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.420
owner of a file let's say, owner happens
to be Alice, controls who this file

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.400
can be shared with, and Alice gives
Bob access to read this file.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.910
The problem arises because Alice
is not going to be able to control

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.070
if the information is going to
stay with her and Bob only.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.790
So the problem is, can Bob share this
information further with somebody else?

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.960
One problem that we have here with
the DAC model is that although we can

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.160
control direct access to our files,
but how that information can be shared

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.220
with others we're not able
to fully control that.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.420
In particular, this problem is called
the information flow control problem.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.210
So information was shared with Bob,
flows from Alice to Bob, but

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.730
can it flow further?

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.090
And in the Discretionary Access Control
model we're not able to control this

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.020
flow going from Bob to Charlie.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.709
There is another problem that
Discretion Access Control has and

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.980
this is because of the idea that
resource is owned by the user and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.830
it is at his discretion
who it can be shared with.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.690
Well, in many organizations at companies
it's really not at your discretion.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.320
You are an employee of a company and the
company actually controls how certain

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.560
type of data should be shared in
that company or outside of that.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.470
In other words,
the employer of the company

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.820
where the user works actually
may be able to mandate or

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.250
will mandate actually how certain
kinds of sensitive data can be shared.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.560
So to address these two problems,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.120
we actually going to explore
another model for access control.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.030
It's called the Mandatory Access Control
model and it's called

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.300
Mandatory Access Control because it
is not at the discretion of the user.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.950
Discretionary Access Control is at the
discretion of the owner of a resource.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.900
But here organization is going to
mandate how data can be shared and

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.120
that's why it's called
Mandatory Access Control.
