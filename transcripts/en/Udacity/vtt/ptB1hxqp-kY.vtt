00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.174
Awesome. Now we have a very beautiful looking rational expression on the left

00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:08.255
hand side, and that's set in this inequality, with a 0 on the right hand side.

00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:12.419
Now we're in a position where we can find the critical numbers for this rational

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.570
inequality. So think back to how we find critical numbers and what they mean.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.598
Remember they're the numbers that are going to split up our number line. And

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:24.133
please type all the critical numbers that you can find in this box.
