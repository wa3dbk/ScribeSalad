00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.280
Playing audio in the car is another
key feature of Android Auto.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.870
You can use either the touchscreen to
select songs based on a variety of

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.730
criteria, or you can use your voice
to speak the name of a song or

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.610
artist using the voice button
on the steering wheel.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.070
This is great because the user is
driving a car meaning they need minimal

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.380
distractions and they need to
keep their eyes on the road.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.980
So let's take a quick look at
what it looks like to play

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.790
audio with Android Auto.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.220
And then I'll show you
how to implement this.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.080
So here's our universal media player
sample app, which is installed and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.920
running on my phone here.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.330
Android Auto is able to
connect to the app and

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.230
then browse through
the media collection.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.219
The user can perform a search
using voice commands.

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:44.591
Play music jazz.

00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:46.959
[SOUND]

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:51.328
[MUSIC]

00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:53.708
You can also touch the screen
to browse as well.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.976
So I'll pick something
in the rock genre.

00:00:57.976 --> 00:01:01.539
[MUSIC]

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.486
And there you go, it's that easy to use,
and in this lesson,

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:07.480
I'm going to show you how
we implement all of this.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.058
We're going to explain how to use
the Android media browsing framework.

00:01:11.058 --> 00:01:11.780
We're going to walk you through

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.910
a short sample that implements
basic functionality, and

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.820
then, how to implement a full
featured media playing application

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.050
that works on Android Auto as well
as lots of other platforms as well.
