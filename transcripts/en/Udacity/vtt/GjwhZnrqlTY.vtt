00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And now I'm going to be really demanding.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I would like to know what is the variance of the mean, not the sum, but the mean.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm going to put 1/N over here--the same sum as before.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is what you do, for example, when you compute the mean outcome of an election from a sample

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of size N. You take the sum of the things you saw and you compute the mean.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's the formula of the mean, but now I'm asking what's the variance of the mean.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So I'm not asking for this one over here--we asking for this one over here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And as a hint, at some point we talked about something like the following--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what if you multiple a variable by a constant A, what happens to its variance?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It was something times variance X.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's do the first. What goes in there.
