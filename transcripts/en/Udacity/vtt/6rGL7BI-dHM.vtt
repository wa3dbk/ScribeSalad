00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.266
let's look at the solution with our storage comparison quiz. The total access

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:10.606
time with the disk will be when we play a game, we will read two gigabytes

00:00:10.606 --> 00:00:15.679
at 100 megabytes a second, so we will spend 20 seconds reading

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.247
these two gigabytes. And we will also spend ten

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:25.392
seconds writing to the ten megabytes. So we will spend 30 seconds

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.655
here and then a sequential read of the

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:31.290
one gigabyte here will be another ten seconds.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.407
So over the four hours we spent 40

00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:36.692
seconds reading and writing you, using the disk, we

00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:39.862
repeat that four times. And we get 40

00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:44.630
seconds times four, equals 160 seconds. With flash, we

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.420
get one gigabyte per second so we will

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.920
get two seconds and change and another one second.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:00.370
So we will get 3.01 seconds times 4. We get 12.04 seconds. Which is way better

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.220
than the disk. But if all we have is flash, we have to buy a lot of flash,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.680
and we probably paid thousands of dollars. So,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.910
now let's say what happens with the disk and

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.300
the four gigabytes of flash. The first time

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.120
we read these two gigabytes and another ten megabytes,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.200
we will read them in 30 seconds, because we are accessing our disk, but then we

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.835
move them to the flash. The next read is going to be the one gigabyte again in

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:31.618
ten seconds but we move them to the flash. So we spend 40 seconds accessing

00:01:31.618 --> 00:01:37.228
the disk in the first round of this, and we spend 3.01 seconds

00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:42.473
copying this data to the flash. After that, we're having

00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:47.953
the flash access time. So all together we have 40 seconds of disk access

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:53.686
time, plus 1 4th of this for copying to the flash, and 3 4ths of this for

00:01:53.686 --> 00:01:56.871
actually reading off the flash the same as

00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:00.840
here, for a total of 52.04 seconds. So

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.150
although it's slower than pure flash, it's still

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.160
much faster than pure disk. And this is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.919
about as costly as a single disk, because four

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.310
gigabytes of flash are not going to cost us that much.
