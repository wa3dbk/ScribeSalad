In addition to the questions on templates, we also got a lot of questions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
about separating your data and your Python information

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and your app handlers into multiple files.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Right now, we're basically doing everything in main.py,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is okay because our web applications are small enough that it doesn't really matter.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But if you're going to be writing something for production

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
for everyone potentially to be using, then that doesn't really work anymore.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Once you start getting into thousands or tens of thousands

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
or even more lines of code, it's just unfeasible.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So there are a lot of ways you can do that depending on what language you're using

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and what template engines you're using.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The template editors we're going to be talking about in another video.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
With Python it's actually pretty simple.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Any Python files in the same folder you just say,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"import [the name of the file]" except for the file extension, .py,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and that's really about it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's very simple to use.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I will be linking to the docs on that, too, but that's essentially all you have to do for it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And I would recommend if you're doing production web application design

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or any kind of serious web application design, that you want to start separating that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
into logical chunks so that it is easier for you to maintain,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and other people to maintain, too, if you're working with other people.
