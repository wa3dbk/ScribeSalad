Hi, my name is Jenny Kim. I'm a project manager here

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.860
at Udacity. And my job is basically to, basically to keep,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.940
a whole bunch of different people and processes and resources organized

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.250
so that the courses are delivered on time. Including this course.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.670
So, I'm going to tell you a little about my phone.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.240
It's a new phone. I got it a couple weeks ago.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.460
It's a, it's a a Nexus 5. The screen is awesome.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.160
It's really pretty. It's really fun to touch and to use.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.670
The one thing is I haven't actually made it a phone yet

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.580
because I don't have the little SIM card. I haven't had time

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.400
to go get that done, so I just use it on wi-fi

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.910
networks for the time being. So far my favorite app is Gmail.
