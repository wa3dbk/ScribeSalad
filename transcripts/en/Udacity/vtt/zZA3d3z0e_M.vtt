00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.141
So let's see if we can figure out how we
should allocate memory in a NUMA System

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:06.910
so that it works well.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.620
Our operating system should
put the stack pages for

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.400
core N in the memory slice N.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.020
Put all data pages ever touched by
core N in the memory slice N, and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.730
put all data pages mostly accessed
by Core N in the memory slice N.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.270
More than one of these
could be correct or

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.750
potentially, none of them are correct.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.920
You need to select all that are correct.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.550
What should the operating system do?
