are less. But this is about the average price of college today. If tuition and

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.129
fees increase by 4.8% each year, how much would you expect to pay next year?

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:17.237
Take your time on this quiz. Think about if you have to add or subtract a

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.729
percentage to 100%. Also, be careful when you convert your percent to a decimal.

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:25.985
