00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:07.309
before allowing you to draw. From there, we actually loop through each of our

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.079
canvas tile arrays and test whether or not it's visible with the function that

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.649
we used before. If it is, we go ahead and call draw image to the main canvas,

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.160
passing in the canvas handle for the offspring canvas. And, of course,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.694
offsetting the x and y values of this tile canvas by the viewRect position,

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:23.332
centering it in world properly.
