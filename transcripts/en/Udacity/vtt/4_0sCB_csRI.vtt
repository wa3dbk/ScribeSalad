00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're here at SLAC National Accelerator Lab,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and we're going to see how they use computing to understand the mysteries of the universe.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
[Spencer Gessner:] We're standing in the klystron gallery, formerly the longest building in the world.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
[Richard Mount:] You're here at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is a 50-year-old laboratory, as all the flags on the lampposts around the lab are telling you.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It was founded to build a 2-mile-long linear accelerator.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
SLAC is an accelerator laboratory still.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Its main science is based on accelerating particles and creating new states of matter

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or exploring the nature of matter with the accelerated particles.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This always has generated a lot of data, a lot of information.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It's very data-intensive experimental science.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
&gt;From the earliest days of SLAC computing

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to analyze data has been a major part of the activity here.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You really can only study the cosmos by studying it in a computer.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You get one chance to look at it,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but to understand how it evolved into the state it is now,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
you have to do all this in the computer.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
There are massive computations going on for that sort of simulation,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
massive computations in catalysis and material science

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and massive data analysis going on here as well.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The particular particle physics experiment

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that I am involved in right now has some 300 petabytes of disk space--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
some 300,000 terabytes, some 300 million gigabytes of disk space

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
around the world to do this analysis.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Of course, we are far from understanding everything about the universe,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
but this is probably one of the most data-intensive activity in science today.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The raw data rate coming out of the ATLAS detector that I'm involved in

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
is about a petabyte a second.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
That's 1 million gigabytes a second.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You can't store that with any budget known to man,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so most of it is inspected on the fly and reduced to a much smaller, but still large, storable amount of data.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Right now we are sifting through these many, many petabytes of data

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to look for signals of the Higgs boson, as no doubt people have heard in the news.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
There are tantalizing hints that I'm not holding my breath about at all right now,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
but this is the way we do it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You need to have those vast amounts of data

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
just to pick out the things that will really revolutionize physics in there,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and you need to understand all of it in detail, because what you're looking for

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
is something slightly unusual compared with everything else.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If you don't understand everything else perfectly then you don't understand anything.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
[Max Swiatlowski:] We're looking at one of the racks that contains

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the ATLAS proof buster at SLAC.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
ATLAS is an experimental Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that collides protons, fundamental building blocks of nature,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
traveling at very, very, very close to the speed of light

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
with trillions of times the energy that they have at room temperature.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You get many and many of these collisions happening at once

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and this enormous machine that reads out trillions of data channels.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
At the end of the day, you have this enormous amount of data--petabytes of data--

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that you have to analyse looking for very rare, very particular signatures inside of that.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
If I want to look for a rare signature--something that had a lot of energy

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and a lot of really strange particles at once--

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
there are trillions and trillions of these events stored on this machine.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
To look for them in any reasonable amount of time,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I have to do many searches at once.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I have to use all the cores on the computers--

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
the hundreds of cores on the machine all running at full-speed at the same time--

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to have any hope of doing it in any reasonable amount of time.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
[Richard Mount:] This isn't the sort of thing that search engines currently do.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
They're looking for text strings and indexing all the text strings that they find

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in some way like this.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
What we have is very, very structured.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We know the structure of these data.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We know exactly how to go to anything that we want to get to in these data,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
because the way in which everything is linked together is very well understood.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Things will go wrong all the time.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You cannot assume you won't lose data from the disk.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
You send it by network from one computer center to another.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You cannot assume it arrives undamaged.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You cannot assume your computers don't die in the middle of calculations.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Everything can go wrong, so the computing we do for the LHC

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
has many layers of error correction and retry.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Some of the basic failure rates are quite high,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but by the time everything has been fairly automatically retried

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and errors have been corrected, we get high throughput and a high success rate.
