00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.200
For our purposes,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.660
we won't have to work with the most
general satisfiability problem.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.070
Rather, we can restrict ourselves to
a simpler case, where the boolean

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.160
formula has a particular structure
called, conjunctive normal form, or CNF.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.490
Like this one here.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.270
First, consider the operators.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.880
The v indicates a logical or.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.840
The wedge indicates a logical and.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
And the bar over top of one of
the variables indicates logical not.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.750
For one of these formulas we need to
define a collection of variables, x, y,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.189
and z, in this example.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.860
And these variables appear
in the formula as literals.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.850
A literal can be either a variable,
or the variables negation.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.807
For example this x or this y bar, etc.

00:00:43.807 --> 00:00:46.265
At the next higher
level we have clauses,

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:48.880
which are disjunctions of literals.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.800
You could also say
logical ors of literals.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.720
One clause is what lies in
between a pair of parenthesis.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.310
And finally,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.550
we have the formula as a whole,
which is a conjunction of clauses.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.510
That is to say,
all the clauses get anded together.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.850
Thus this whole formula is
in conjunctive normal form.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.590
In general, there can be more than
two clauses that get anded together.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.990
That covers the terms we'll use for
the structure of a CNF formula.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.170
As for satisfiability itself.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.960
We say that a boolean
formula is satisfiable

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.900
if there is a truth assignment for
the formula.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.730
A way of assigning variables true and

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.560
false such that the formula
evaluates to true.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.030
The CNF satisfiability problem is,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.400
given a CNF formula, determine if that
formula has a satisfying assignment.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.440
Clearly this formula is in NP.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.460
Since given any truth assignment,
it takes time, polynomial, and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.290
the number of literals
to evaluate the formula.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.630
Thus we've accomplished the first part
of showing that satisfiability is

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.170
NP complete.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.050
The other part,
showing that every problem in the NP is

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.330
polynomial time reducible to it,
will be considerably more difficult.
