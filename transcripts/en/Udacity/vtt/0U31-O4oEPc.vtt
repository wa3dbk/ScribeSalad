And what we need to make a network work is

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.820
a Protocol. And what a protocol is, a set of rules

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.460
that people agree to, that tell you how two entities

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.530
can talk to each other. So, for the web, the protocol

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.610
gives rules about how a client and a server talk

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.570
to each other. The client is the web browser and the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.300
server, is the web server. So that might be udacity

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.220
dot com. The web browser is what you're running at home.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.670
And what the protocol says is, if you want to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.370
get the server to do something, the client has

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.180
to send a message in a particular way. The

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.400
protocol that we use on the web, is called hypertext

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.760
transfer proto, protocol. Which is abbreviated as HTTP. When

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.210
you look in your browser, almost all the URLs that

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.090
you use start with HTTP. That indicates that the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.890
protocol, that you should use to talk to the sever,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.380
that you're requesting a document from, is this protocol, called

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.040
hyper text transfer protocol. An it's a very simple protocol.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.245
There aren't, too many messages. There's actually only two main

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:05.095
messages and there is only one, we'll talk about. That's

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:08.610
the message called GET. The client can send a message

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.150
to the server, where the message says get, and then

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.090
the name of that object that you want to get.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.032
So that's all the client does. It sense the message

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:19.450
like this, and if you remember the python code for get

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.060
page. Well, let's call in some library function that actually does

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.460
this. That's sending the get message to the server. The server

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.920
will get that message. It will do some, run some code

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.310
on it. It will find a file that was requested. It

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.220
might run some more code to get the result. Take the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.920
web application course to understand more about what the server does,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.780
but what matters to the client, and what matters to us

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.710
in using this, is what happens after that. The server

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.650
sends back a response, which is the contents of the

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.440
requested object. So that's the whole protocol, that's what's going

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.040
on whether you send a web request using your browser, by

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.370
clicking on a link. Well then the browsers doing a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.220
lot of things to figure out what you requested and then

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.080
its sending a get message to the right web server.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.830
That was the server specified by the URL, to know which

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.780
server it is, and then its getting a response and its

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.990
doing processing on that response to render it. If you want to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.060
understand more about what the web browser is doing, take the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.100
programming languages class that focuses on how to build a web browser.
