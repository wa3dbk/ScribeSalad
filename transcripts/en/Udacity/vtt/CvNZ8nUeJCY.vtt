00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.170
We're going to stop here for
a little bit, let you catch your breath.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.130
Go back, review, have a beverage of your
choice, make sure you understand this or

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.880
just complain that gee,
this seems redundant with what we did

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.100
right before the Kalman filter,
because yes, the math is quite similar.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.630
In fact, underneath it's identical.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.605
But what we're doing is we're moving
to get to this notion of a normalized

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:24.060
Bayes' rule application as
opposed to the straight Kalman.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.210
And then what we're going to do is
we're going to use that particle

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.230
representation that I showed
you before to, to do this and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.710
it'll all become much clearer I hope.
