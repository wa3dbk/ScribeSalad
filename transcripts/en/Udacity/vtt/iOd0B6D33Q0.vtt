00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.608
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; To start off, we need to figure out what two numbers add to equal 10, and

00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:07.550
multiply to equal negative 24. It took me a little while to come up with these,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.698
since there are so many different sets of numbers that multiplied equal negative

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:15.709
24, but it turns out that our two numbers are positive 12, and negative 2. Once

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.967
we use those in the expression, you can go through just like we normally do.

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:24.241
This gives us the quantity, x plus 2, times the quantity 6x minus 2. But

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.980
remember what we said about factoring. We're not done fully factoring if there

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.745
are any common terms left within any of our factors. Notice that 6 and negative

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:38.012
2 share a common factor of 2. We can pull out the 2, and then rearrange the

00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:42.377
order of our factors, but this looks a little bit more normal. And here's our

00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:46.252
final answer. 2 times the quantity x plus 2, times the quantity 3x minus 1.

00:00:46.252 --> 00:00:50.135
There is however, one other way we could have done this. We can notice, right

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:54.103
off the bat, that all of our coefficients in the original expression have a

00:00:54.103 --> 00:00:57.797
common factor of, guess what, 2. Now this expression inside here is pretty

00:00:57.797 --> 00:01:01.042
easily factorable as well, and we won't run into the problem that we did

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:04.771
earlier, of having common factors left within our factors at the end. Go ahead

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.248
and try it on your own to see if doing the problem this way gives you the same

00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:11.687
answer as the other way did. Hint, it should end up exactly the same, since

00:01:11.687 --> 00:01:13.660
we're starting with the same expression.
