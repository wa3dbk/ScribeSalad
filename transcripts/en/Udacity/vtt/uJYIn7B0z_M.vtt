00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.840
&gt;&gt; So like you said [UNKNOWN], the plan of putting D on table's kind of trivial.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.470
And we actually see that it's the first step of any other plan.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.825
So we don't really need to articulate that explicitly. For putting A on B,

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.694
our fastest idea would be to put D on the table, then to put B on the table,

00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:19.860
then to put A on top of B. I would just get a straight to putting A on B.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.540
For putting B on C, we need to put D on the table, B on the table,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.430
A on the table, and then move B on to the top of C. And then, for

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.250
putting for C on D, we would need to move D to the table, B to the table,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.270
A to the table, and then put C on top of D.
