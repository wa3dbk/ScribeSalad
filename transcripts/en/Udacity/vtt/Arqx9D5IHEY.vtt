00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.963
Let's try to find the zeros then. We can use the rational zero theorem to come

00:00:03.963 --> 00:00:08.250
up with some ideas for what our zeros might be. So what are all of the possible

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.194
rational zeros this test tells us about. Please write them in this box and

00:00:12.194 --> 00:00:16.222
separate them by commas. Don't forget the negative numbers.
