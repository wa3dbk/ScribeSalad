Thinking back to the beginning of the lesson, remember that Athena was

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:09.396
interested in figuring out what value of cut length or x, would maximize the

00:00:09.396 --> 00:00:13.794
volume of her box. So the question I have for you is, on this interval that

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:18.546
we've decided are possible values for x in our situation, which of those values

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.789
leads to that maximum volume? See if you can figure out a ballpark range on the

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.154
graph, of where you think that maximum point is. Estimate what the x coordinate

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:31.873
of that point is, and then pick the point over here that you think is closest.
