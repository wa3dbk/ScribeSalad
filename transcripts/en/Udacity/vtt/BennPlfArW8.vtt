00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Okay, and the answer is Apache/22.3.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, if you put in

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Big IP,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we accepted that, but I'm pretty sure you didn't use urlib2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Because when I was finding the answer to this,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I also cheated, used curl, and got Big IP,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is actually what www.example.com uses,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but urllib2 automatically follows redirects,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the server it redirects to uses Apache.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So let me show you how I got the example,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then we'll go ahead and talk about what happened with the redirect.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay, so the way I found this answer is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I used urllib2.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I used the url open function to hit www.example.com.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I stored that in a variable,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then I looked at its headers.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I see that the server is Apache/22.3.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And that's the correct answer.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we look at the url attribute on P,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we see it's actually iana.org.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, if you remember from Unit 1, I asked you what is the location header

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
when you hit www.example.com.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And that was because--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And this was the answer, because example.com redirects to iana.org.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, urllib2 automatically follows redirects,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which can sometimes be confusing.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And in this case, it automatically followed the redirect.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It hit iana.org, whose server is Apache.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But we're going to do this by hand. I'm going to use curl.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is the Unit 1 example.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We can see that server is actually Big IP.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So hopefully you used urllib2, but if you cheated like I did

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
when I was writing this quiz and you saw Big IP, we'll also accept that.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And it's important to know, when you're using these libraries,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that a lot of these libraries--urllib2,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the default one included in Google App Engine called URL Fetch--

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
they follow redirects automatically.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And if you don't want to follow the redirects,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
say your are writing a grading script for your homeworks,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
you need to look up the docs.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There's almost always an option to tell the library not to follow automatically follow redirects.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So that's something to keep in mind when you get behavior you don't expect

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
as just happened to me.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.153
Okay, let's move on.
