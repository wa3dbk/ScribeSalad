00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.380
Here is the graphical representation of the garage door opener.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.803
I've used rectangles in this case, but there are six, six states indicating

00:00:08.803 --> 00:00:14.080
the six states we, we listed before. The the arc,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.610
the transition arcs have two two expressions on them.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.370
The first one, the first is the event causing the transition,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.540
if there's then a slash, the second one is the event to take,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.659
that will happen upon that transition occurring. So imagine, for

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:38.220
example we're at the bottom, in the state labeled Door Open Motor Off.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.240
And in this case, there's only one outgoing arc.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.300
The user has pressed the button and, in this case, the motor starts and

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.300
it moves into the state where the motor is running downward. The door was open,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.429
it was at the top. Hence, the only place that the door can go is downward.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.400
Similarly, you can walk yourself through the diagram.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.310
The interesting situation involving epsilon transition takes place

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.200
if you are in the bottommost state on the right,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.030
labelled Motor Running Down. If, then, the button is pressed, okay,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.610
recall that the first thing that happens is the motor is stopped and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.470
we transition into the Door Partially Closed Motor Off state just above it.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.050
But when we go on, okay, remember the, the safety concern. The door was going

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.170
down and we stopped, and we now want to take it up. So there's a transition to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.610
the left in which there is no event causing the transition. Okay? So

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.970
immediate transition and what we want to do is start the motor going upward and

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.650
end up in the state at the extreme left labeled Motor Running Up
