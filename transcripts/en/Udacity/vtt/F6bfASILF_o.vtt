00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.861
This parabola will have a vertex at negative 3, negative 4. 3 units left, and 4

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:12.460
units down. We can start from the basic graph y equals x squared. We know that

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.372
that vertex is centered at the origin. If we subtract 4 from this equation we

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:23.736
know that the entire parabola shifts down four units. Essentially all the y

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:28.590
values from the original graph that we had before shifted down four units.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.406
Notice to that the y coordinate of the vertex is now negative 4. And we see

00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:39.194
this reflected in the equation. We have a negative 4 tacked on to the end. So

00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:43.442
we know that the y coordinate of the vertex is negative 4. And to find the x

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:49.112
coordinate of the vertex we take our binomial and we set it equal to 0. Solving

00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:53.990
for x will get x is equal to negative 3, the x coordinate of our vertex.
