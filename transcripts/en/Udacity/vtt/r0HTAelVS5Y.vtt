00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Much like ranking ranking pain, I want you to think about ranking gains.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And so, think about it and make a list of what each gain your products and services create

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
according to its relevance to the customer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is the big idea--the relevance to the customer because much like in pain,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you're going to make your first list thinking you got it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Here is what I'm going to solve for pain and here is what I'm going to create for gain.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I absolutely know this--"Why?" because it's my opinion or I might have been a domain expert,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but you know what at the end of the day your business isn't about your opinion.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What you need to do is now hear this from customers who say, "Here is why it's relevant."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And much like pain, you want to understand--is this a substantial or insignificant gain created

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and again understand the frequency that it occurs.
