00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.500
Why do we have this potential for

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.330
performance loss, with the microkernel based design?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.710
Mainly because of the border crossings. That

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.320
is, going across hardware address spaces, can

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.230
be quite expensive. First there is this

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.050
explicit cost of switching the address space,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.030
from one hardware address space to another

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.610
hardware address space. That is the explicit cost.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.700
And in addition to the explicit cost

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.640
of going across address spaces, there are implicit

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.210
costs involved in this border crossing. And that

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.640
comes about because of change in locality. We're

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.760
going from one hardware address space to a

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840
different address space, and that changes the locality

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.230
of execution of the processor. And that means

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.810
that me memory hierarchy, the caches in particular,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.430
close to the processor, may not have the contents that are needed for

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.320
executing the code and accessing the data

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.610
structures of a particular server, different from

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.730
the application. A change in locality is

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.920
another important determinant of performance and it

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.120
can adversely effect the performance. And also,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.390
when we are going across address spaces

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.050
to ensure the integrity of the system, either the micro kernel, or the server

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.850
that is living on top of the microkernel. There may be a need to copy from

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.500
user space to system space. And those

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.530
kind of copying of data from the application's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.510
memory space into the microkernel and back out

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.720
to a server process. All of those can

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.630
result in affecting the performance of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.390
the operating system. Whether they're in a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.350
monolithic structure, since all the components

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.830
are contained within the same address space,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.130
it is much easier for sharing data without copying. And that's one of

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.830
the biggest potential sources of performance loss

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.810
when we have this microkernel based structure.
