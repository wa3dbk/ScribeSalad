00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:12.958
barely dipping our toes in the water when it comes to using formulas, but that's

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.116
why I'm asking quizzes like these, so that you get more and more comfortable

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:21.380
using formulas and understanding what they mean. So give it your best shot.
