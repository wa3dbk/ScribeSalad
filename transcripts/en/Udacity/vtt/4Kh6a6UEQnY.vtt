00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.075
Welcome to the unit on Modules and Classes. As we build larger and more complex

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:09.875
programs we quickly end up with programs that are far too big for one person to

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:14.172
keep in their head at any one time. One solution to this would be to have your

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:18.031
head explode, this only works once. Instead what we need are Techniques to

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:21.938
Manage Complexity. And that's going to be the focus of this unit as well as some

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.544
of the things that we cover in later lessons. This is one of the main things

00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:29.352
that distinguishes experienced programmers from beginners, is this ability to

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:34.210
Manage Complexity, to deal with larger and larger programs. And the biggest idea

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.570
for that is actually modularity. Unlike exploding heads, breaking up programs

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.164
into pieces is actually a good thing. In this unit we'll look at two mechanisms

00:00:42.164 --> 00:00:45.479
that Python provides top help programmers break things up into pieces in a way

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.072
that doesn't make your head explode. The first is Modules, and the second is

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:54.596
Classes. By using these ideas well you'll be able to construct large and complex

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.423
programs without your head blowing up into pieces.
