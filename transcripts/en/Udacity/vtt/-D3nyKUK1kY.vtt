This scatter plot here shows the relationship between the number of caffeinated

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:10.019
drinks people consume, and the hours that they sleep. Each of these dots

00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:15.187
represents one person. So, for example, this person consumed about 3 caffeinated

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.284
drinks and only slept about 5 hours. This data was collected from a survey of 9

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:23.746
individuals. From this graph, what can you conclude?
