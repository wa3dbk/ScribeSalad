00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.320
Right here in our diagram, you can see that the only interesting aspect of what

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.430
has changed is that this function object is not storing the methods container

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.040
object at the key.methods, instead, it's being stored at the key.prototype.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.420
People tend to get very, very tripped up at this point because they start to

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.050
imagine that this .prototype property has some special rules about it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.100
that will influence how this code ought to work.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.660
But in truth, nothing interesting has changed.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.630
The only thing that's different is we've chosen to use a different name

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.900
to talk about that storage object where we're putting all of the methods.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.070
And perhaps it's slightly interesting that the language provided that object for

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.700
us, but that object does not have any unique or

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.280
interesting aspect about it that we've discussed so far.
