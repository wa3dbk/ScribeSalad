Remember that we've actually started talking about digital image is a function.

00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:06.646
And this is something we've covered in the previous set of sub-lectures.

00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:10.440
What I have introduced in those lectures is that we can actually talk

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.767
about an image basically as a function with we can actually look at an x and

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.581
y axis with the intensity in the third dimension.

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.409
That has allowed us to create images, or looking at images like this one,

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.618
the mandrill image we have looked at before.

00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:27.070
And the bottom line of all of this has been that we want to be able to

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.843
represent an image as a matrix.

00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:33.662
Where we can now traverse through this matrix in discreet Indices i and

00:00:33.662 --> 00:00:38.723
j to be able to get any kind of value that we would be interested in to then for

00:00:38.723 --> 00:00:41.070
example extract content.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.980
And for example look at, the intensities at specific values, and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.380
do some sort of processing with it.
