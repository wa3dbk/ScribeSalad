00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.040
So here's one way to solve the quiz; we're going to create a dictionary

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.520
called Population, and then we'll add some cities to it. We'll add Shanghai,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.345
has population 17.8 million. Istanbul has population

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:19.870
13.3 million. Karachi has population 13 million, and

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.900
Mumbai has population 12.5. I'm also going to add my home town,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.160
which is Charlottesville, and the population of Charlottesville is pretty small

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.540
compared to Shanghai. It is 0.043 million people. Only 43,000. So now we've

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.470
created our dictionary. We've populated it with some entries. We can print those

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.444
out. So if we look at the value of population of Shanghai,

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:54.860
that will get that entry in the dictionary, and we can see that we get the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.460
result 17.8; we can also print out the

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.105
population of Charlottesville, and we get the result 0.043
