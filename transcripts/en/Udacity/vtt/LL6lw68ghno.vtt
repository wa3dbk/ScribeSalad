00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.780
Now let us consider, the processing of the fourth example comes along.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.520
Again the red outline shows that this is a negative example of the constant.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.400
Because this is a negative example, we must specialize in most journal

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.880
concept characterizations available at the moment. We can begin by checking,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.480
whether we need to specialize this particular general concept. But wait,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.280
this general concept characterization, already excludes the negative example.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.780
This says the earlier happens when I go to Sam's, and this has Bob's in it, so

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.600
this already excludes it, I don't have to specialize it any more.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.737
Now let's look at this general model. Does this need to be specialized,

00:00:35.737 --> 00:00:41.050
in order to excluded? Yes, because at the current stage, this includes this

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.940
vertical example. It is cheap here, this is cheap, this is any here, and this

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.400
has particle elements within. This means that, this concept characterization,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.190
must be specialized in a way that excludes this negative example and yet.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.590
The new specialization, is consistent with the most specialized characterization

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.290
at present. It is tempting to see the two pathways as converging here,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.790
because this is identical to that, but we also have this branch hanging, and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.720
this branch says that I'm allergic to any meal at Sam's, not just a cheap meal.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.650
So, we're not done yet. In this state there is one other element to consider.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.760
If there is a node, that lies on a pathway starting from the most journal

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.330
concept characterization, that is subsumed by a node, that comes from

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.660
another pathway starting from the same journal concept characterization, then I

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.390
want to prune that particular node. The reason I wanted to put on this note is,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.820
because this note is subsumed by this note. So this note is true,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.040
I don't have to carry this around. If I'm allergic to any meat at Sam's,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.120
I don't have to specify that I'm allergic to cheap meat at Sam's, thus I can

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.460
pull on this particular pathway, and I've left it only this particular pathway.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.930
At this point in processing, these are the examples that have been encountered

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.120
so far. There are only two possible. I'm either allergic to everything at Sam's,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.530
or I'm allergic to every cheap meal at Sam's.
