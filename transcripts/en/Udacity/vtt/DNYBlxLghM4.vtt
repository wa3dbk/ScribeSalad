00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.806
When we solve this radical equation, p should equal positive 8. Nice thinking

00:00:04.806 --> 00:00:08.466
if you got this one correct. When raising this left hand side to the 2nd power,

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:13.280
we'll be left with the expression underneath the radical. So we'll just get p

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.970
plus 1. On the right hand side, we'll square 3 to get a value of positive 9. We

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.550
subtract 1 from both sides to isolate p, so 1p equals positive 8. One thing we

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.541
want to do with radical equations is always check our answer. Sometimes this

00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:32.424
answer won't work in the original radical. Because sometimes it makes this

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:36.448
radicand negative. We don't want that to be the case, so we can take the square

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:41.474
root. So let's check for 8. We'll replace p with the value of 8, take the

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:46.612
square root of 8 plus 1, which is 9, and that equals 3. We come out with a true

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:50.800
statement on the end of 3 equals 3. So yes, this is the correct answer.
