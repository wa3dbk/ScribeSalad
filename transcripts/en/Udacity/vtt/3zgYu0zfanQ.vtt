00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:09.330
We'll have positive 3 for the first one, negative 3 for the second one, and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.134
negative 51 for the third one. Great work, if you've done all three of those.

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:16.203
Now if you weren't quite sure what to do, that's okay. Let's see how it's done.

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:16.931
For the first problem, we know that the a value's really equal to 3. So, we're

00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:20.822
going to square this 3. Our b value is really squared to 6, so we'll square the

00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:27.500
square root of 6. 3 squared equals 9 and the square root of 6 squared is 6.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.502
Then we just subtract these two numbers to get positive 3. For our second

00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:35.166
problem, the a value is really equal to the square root of 2. And our b value

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:39.500
is really equal to the square root of 5. Squaring this square root leaves us

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.331
with 2. And squaring this square root leaves us with 5. So 2 minus 5 equals

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:47.671
negative 3 and this last difference of squares, will have a as 2 root of 3 and

00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:54.484
b as 3 root of 7 and here's where we want to be careful. We want to square this

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:59.630
2 and this square root of 3. We know 2 square root is 4. And the square root of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.576
3 squared is 3. There's a multiplication between this number and this radical,

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:07.860
so after we square there's still multiplication between this number and this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.630
number. We square 3 root 7 to get 9 times 7. Next we multiply 4 times 3 to get

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.550
12 and 9 times 7 to get 63, and then subtract to get our final answer of

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.443
negative 51. Now I think that's pretty incredible that we can take something

00:01:22.443 --> 00:01:25.720
that contains radicals. and pop out just one number
