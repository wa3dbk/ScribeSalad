00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.330
The third and last criterion to examine has to do with concrete operations,

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.660
modelling abstract ones. That is, each concrete operation must

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.940
faithfully reflect the intent of the abstract specification.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.570
You had to do your implementation right. And this criterion has two parts,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.260
having to do with inputs and outputs to operations. That is to refine

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.600
operations, we must assure ourselves of two things. The implementation must be

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.380
able to handle all the imports described in the specification. And the outputs

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.580
produced by the operation, along with any changes made to class attributes or

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.940
other side effects, must satisfy the operation specification.
