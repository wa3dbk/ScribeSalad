00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.815
You've just written the same algorithm twice, once for countries and then for

00:00:03.815 --> 00:00:07.673
cars. And you probably passionately wish to never again have to do that for any

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:11.817
other class. So, let's see how we can come up with a generic way of computing

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:17.486
averages. The trouble was that the cars and countries had different ways of

00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:22.912
measuring whatever it is that they wanted to be measured by. By with the car it

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:27.455
was the fuel efficiency, with the country it was the area. But let's say they

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:31.702
both agreed on what it meant for them to be measured. Let's say, they both

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:36.787
implemented a common interface. I call this interface measurable. Let's look

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:41.858
inside. It just has a single method, getMeasure. We expect each class that

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:44.834
implements this interface to provide an appropriate implementation for

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:51.193
getMeasure. For example, the country class implements getMeasure to return the

00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:57.943
area. The car class has the same method, return miles per gallon. Now, we can

00:00:57.943 --> 00:01:01.365
implement a single method in the data class that would take an array of

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:06.715
measurable objects and it will compute the average measure. That's for you to

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:10.514
complete. In the tester, we'll call this method, first on an array of

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:16.063
countries, then we call the same method again on an array of cars. That's what

00:01:16.063 --> 00:01:19.969
I mean with the reuse, this method only has to be written once and we can call

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.645
it with data sets containing objects of different classes. Now go ahead and

00:01:25.645 --> 00:01:29.049
complete the implementation of the average method.
