00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.741
Now, let's look at how nature and nurture affect IQ. Identical twins share 100%

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:10.241
of their genetic make up. They're genetically identical. Fraternal twins share

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:16.390
only 50% of their genetic makeup. This is also true for siblings and parents.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.901
So, you share 50% of your genetic makeup with each one of your parents. So 50%

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:27.531
with your mom and 50% with your dad. And you share 25% of your genetic makeup

00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:33.593
with your grandparents. Aunt, uncles, nieces and nephews. And people you are

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:38.394
not related to? Well, you guessed it, you share 0% of your genetic make up with

00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:43.812
that. So we can turn these percentages into numbers ranging from 0 not related

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:49.402
to 1 being identical twins, this is called genetic relatedness. Now,

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:53.884
environment has to vary too. Typically, biological parents and children live in

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:57.752
the same household. But that doesn't necessarily mean they have the exact same

00:00:57.752 --> 00:01:02.056
environment, but it is very similar. Now of course, there's also cases where

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:07.420
biological parents and siblings are raised completely separate from each other.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.524
For example, when people are adopted. Now, let's look at a graph to show how IQ

00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:16.198
is related to different types of nature and nurture. Here are our IQ

00:01:16.198 --> 00:01:23.070
correlations. Remember, 0, 1, 2, 3, not very good. They're not really related.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.642
But high correlations mean they're really similar. And here, we'll see if they

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:31.942
share an environment or not. Meaning if they live together or if they don't. So

00:01:31.942 --> 00:01:36.830
first, let's look at identical twins. They have a one on genetic relatedness.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.370
Here we can see that identical twins who were raised together have a 0.85

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.410
correlation between IQ scores. So because they're genetically identical, and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.790
they were raised in the same environment, their IQ scores are really similar.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.330
But we know nature matters because identical twins who also have a one in

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.224
genetic relatedness because they're genetically identical, but were raised

00:01:57.224 --> 00:02:03.288
apart. So they didn't share the same environment, have a 0.75 IQ correlation.

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:07.128
Meaning they're still really similar, but not as close as if they were to live

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:13.948
together. Now, let's look at genetic relatedness of 0.5. Meaning sharing 50% of

00:02:13.948 --> 00:02:18.810
your genetic makeup. So fraternal twins share 50% of their genetic makeup.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.116
Those who were raised together, so they shared an environment have a

00:02:22.116 --> 00:02:27.538
correlation of about 0.6. So that's pretty related. However, if they're raised

00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:33.139
apart, it goes just below .4. Showing that environment does play a big factor

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.251
in IQ. Siblings again, who you share 50% of your makeup with. Those who are

00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:43.344
raised together with a shared environment have just below a .5 correlation. So,

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:47.972
it's not very related. However, if the siblings were raised apart, so they

00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:53.596
didn't share an environment. This significantly drops to just above a 0.2,

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:58.308
which is a really low correlation. And parents who raise their children, so

00:02:58.308 --> 00:03:03.320
sharing an environment with them again have less than a 0.5 correlation.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.720
However when they didn't share an environment, again it drops to about a 0.2.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.908
These show the importance of environment. Now, let's look at adoption. So these

00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:19.046
people have 0 genetic relatedness but they share the same environment. So

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:23.306
adopted siblings are just above a .3 in their IQ correlation and adopted

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:29.026
parents are just below a .2 in their correlation. Even thought they shared the

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:33.060
same environment, they didn't have a very strong correlation among IQ scores.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.338
That shows us that genetics are an important factor too. The formal conclusion

00:03:37.338 --> 00:03:40.872
of these studies says about 50% of the differences between people's

00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:45.964
intelligence is due to genetic influence. In about 40%, its due to

00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:52.072
environmental effects. That leaves 10% being unexplained. So we just don't know

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:52.489
yet.
