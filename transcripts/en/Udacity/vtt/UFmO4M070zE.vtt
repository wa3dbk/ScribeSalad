00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.170
We've seen how to multiply polynomials, so now let's see how we can undo that

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.557
process. In this section, we'll learn how to divide polynomials and how to check

00:00:08.557 --> 00:00:12.983
our answer. Here's a polynomial, and we're going to divide it by one monomial, a

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:17.012
term. This problem's actually very similar to the problems we've seen in

00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:21.127
exponents, and in fact, you already have the skills to solve it. We can write

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:25.762
this another way by dividing the entire polynomial by 2x. These two forms are

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:30.625
equivalent. Next, we divide 2x into each of the terms. So using what you know

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:35.489
about exponents and division, I want you to find the answer or the quotient to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.010
this division problem.
