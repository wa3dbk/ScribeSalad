00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.800
Okay, so I'm looking here to
see if I have any errors.

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:10.212
It looks like I forgot braces here for
dequeue.

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:12.520
So I'm calling that
method correctly now.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.850
So now I'm just going to go ahead and

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.854
go through my test cases
that I mentioned before.

00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:20.222
I'm just going to put them
in this little box here and

00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:23.730
we had our None, our empty brackets.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.167
So we go through these,
zero returns zero immediately, so

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:31.582
that's working, and what about when
we actually have a working test case?

00:00:31.582 --> 00:00:33.858
That goes through most
of this code here.

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:39.160
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.653
Okay, so I go through,
so that one's a 0.

00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.891
Checking the length.

00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:51.216
So, this would be set to 3.

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:53.179
And this would be 2.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.711
So, going through every element.

00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:00.870
So, I find my first one.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.423
I'm incrementing my island count, so
now that's going to be equal to one.

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:12.209
And I got my FindPartsOfIsland method
here, creating my q, appending those

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:17.905
values and then I have my breadth first
search here that I'm going through.

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:23.491
And so for this instance, there is no
one to the right or on the bottom of it,

00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:27.678
so I won't have to do this,
and then I go to the next one.

00:01:27.678 --> 00:01:32.300
Sent zero, so we don't do anything,
we just go through the loop.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.387
One, okay, so

00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:38.254
I'm going to increment my island
count again it's now going to be two.

00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:42.794
So then I go through that and
then I find my parts of island,

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:45.575
so there actually are ones here, so

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:50.135
I'm going to go ahead and
add those, then I add those there.

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:53.293
And that looks all good,
and so this one,

00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:56.190
this one actually get set to 2 there.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.720
And this is going to get set to 2 and

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.340
now I'm adding both of these
to the queue to look at them.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.672
And we're not appending
any this up front,

00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:06.490
I'm only appending that to the queue.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.835
So I'm looking through there,
there's nothing else and so

00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:13.381
basically it's going to be setting
these to 2, and that's, and

00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:17.100
then I'd probably just visit
every element in the array.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.970
There's no more ones, so
that would be end of it.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.587
But it looks like I forgot to
return the number of islands here.

00:02:26.587 --> 00:02:33.266
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:34.170
So it looks like it works.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.900
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.140
Well it looks like all
of his code worked.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.858
Not only is this fellow handsome but
he sure is intelligent.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.619
&gt;&gt; The debugging process
is often overlooked but

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.760
a very important part of
the algorithm interview.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.480
Not only does this show the interviewer
that the candidate checks their code,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.820
it may even help the candidate find
mistakes that they missed the first

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.310
time they were coding their solution.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.610
It's easy to miss a semicolon here and
there if a candidate were coding in some

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.610
language like Java, or
forget to return a result.
