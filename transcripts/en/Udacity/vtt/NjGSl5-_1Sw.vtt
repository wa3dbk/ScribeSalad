00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The force on this mass refers to mass times the acceleration,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is 1.63 m/s², but we know where this force comes from--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
namely, from gravity, so it has to be equal to the constant of gravitation times

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the product of the masses, the mass of the moon -- let's call that m₁,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
times our mass, m₂, divided by the distance squared.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The distance is the radius of the moon.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now let's ignore this part of the equation.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Then you see that m₂, the mass of our object, doesn't matter,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we can solve for m₁.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If you plug in the value of the constant of gravity and do the math,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
you get 7.3 x 10²² kg.
