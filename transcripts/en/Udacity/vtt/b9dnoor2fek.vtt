00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.745
The solution to this compound inequality is negative infinity to negative 1

00:00:04.757 --> 00:00:09.350
union 4 to infinity. How did you do? Did you get it right? If so, great work.

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:13.966
Let's see how we got that. Once again, I'm going to solve these inequalities

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:18.532
independently and I'm going to start skipping a step or two. When I'm solving

00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:23.726
this inequality, I want to subtract 3x from both sides, which gives me 3x plus 5

00:00:23.738 --> 00:00:29.232
is less than 2. Subtracting 5 from both sides, gives me 3x is less than negative

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:34.418
3. Divide both sides by 3, and I get x is less than negative 1. When I solve

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.745
this inequality, I'm going to skip the steps where I'm showing what I'm adding

00:00:39.757 --> 00:00:45.102
or subtracting to each side of the equation. In other words, here, I want to

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:50.640
subtract x from both sides. When I subtract x from 2x, I am simply left with x

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:56.203
plus 7 on the left side and when I subtract x from the right side, x minus x is

00:00:56.215 --> 00:01:01.426
0, so I get x plus 7 is 11. And when I subtract 7 from both sides, I get x is

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:07.005
greater than 11 minus 7, which is 4. I have x is less than negative 1 or x is

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:11.175
greater than 4. Let's see what that looks like on a number line. When I graph

00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:14.900
the solution of x is less than negative 1 on the number line, I have a

00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:19.115
parenthesis because it's less than, and I know it's going to the left because

00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:23.647
it's less than. Similarly, x is greater than 4 We've put a parenthesis at 4 and

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.015
since it's greater than, we're going to the right. The solution on the number

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:32.296
line makes it really easy to write in interval notation. Since this arrow is

00:01:32.308 --> 00:01:36.664
going off to negative infinity, we start at negative infinity and we have to

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:40.611
stop at negative 1. Since it's an or we have a union, and then we start up again

00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:43.799
at 4 and the arrow is going to positive infinity.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:46.468
Let's go ahead and try one more compound inequality.
