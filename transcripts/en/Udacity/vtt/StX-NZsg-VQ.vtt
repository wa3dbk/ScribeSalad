00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.142
This time we have to start from scratch. Plugging in 400 for d, in our equation

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:08.534
N of d, 4 times the square root of 400 gives us 80, so it looks like he's going

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:14.748
to make 80 glass swipers. Now, this output access the input to our second

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:20.102
function for R. R of 80 is just 15 times 80, that gives us 1200, which means

00:00:20.102 --> 00:00:24.206
that Grant will make $1,200 in revenue.
