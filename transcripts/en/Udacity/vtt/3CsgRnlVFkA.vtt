00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.640
Now that our Java joke telling
code is really coming along,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.590
we've broken it out
into its own library.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.210
That way we can reuse
it across projects.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.450
Let's check out how this project works.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.350
Inside our Android app build directory,
we have this javaJokes directory that

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.170
contains a stock Gradle Java project,
just like we've been building all along.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.740
If we use the terminal to navigate to
the javaJokes directory, we can use

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.810
Gradle to build this project on its own,
without reference to the Android app.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.770
However, our app doesn't yet
know anything about this library.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.360
What we need to do is
declare a compile dependency

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.740
on the output of this library project.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.560
To do that,
we need to add the library project

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.860
to the same multi-project
build as our Android app.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.095
We can do that in the settings.gradle
file of the root project.

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:51.413
The settings.gradle file is where we
tell Gradle what sub-projects to include

00:00:51.413 --> 00:00:53.800
in the multi-project build.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.680
We already have the app project for
the Android app, so

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.010
we'll add the javaJokes project.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.210
There we go.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.658
Now if we ask Gradle what projects or
sub-projects in this multi-project

00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:08.150
build, Gradle tells us that there are
two sub-projects, the Android app and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.980
the Java library.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.960
Next we need to declare a project
dependency between our Android app and

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.530
our Java library.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.840
We can do that in the build.gradle
file in the app directory.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.070
Here we simply say that our app
has a compile time dependency

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.955
on the project javaJokes.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.390
Now that we've gone ahead and declared
that dependency, we can go ahead and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.480
import our Java library into
our Android project, and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.740
we can use the class
from our Java library.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.260
If we bust out the old test device,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.730
here's the joke from our Java
library inside our Android app.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.920
When you run this multi-project build,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.730
if you watch the Gradle console
you'll notice something like this.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.088
The app project started
running some tasks.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:53.900
Then the javaJokes project jumped in to
create a jar for the app project to use.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.440
Well, that's all there is to it,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.100
to add a Java library project
to an Android studio build.
