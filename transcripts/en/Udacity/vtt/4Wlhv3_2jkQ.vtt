Cameron, any ideas?

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.980
&gt;&gt; Well, the inline script would block on CSS, so anything we can do to

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.830
make the CSS faster would help. In fact, what if we just inline the CSS?

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would remove an extra request and that could definitely

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.330
help. What about the JavaScript itself? Do you think it should block rendering?

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.530
&gt;&gt; Now that you ask, I don't think so. It's reporting a visit

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.500
to some analytic service and there's no reason for it to block rendering, right?
