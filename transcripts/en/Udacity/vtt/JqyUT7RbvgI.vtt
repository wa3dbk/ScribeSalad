00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.840
Your task was to explore the relationship between friends initiated

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.420
and age. For the ggplot syntax, we're just going to pass it,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.990
x, which will be age, and y, which will be friends

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.930
initiated. We'll put those in the aesthetic wrapper and then pass

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.680
pf, as our data frame. I also need to remember to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.490
specify the geom, so here I'll use geom point for a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.740
scatter plot. This should get me going. It looks like that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.500
I used the wrong variable here, so looking at my data

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.520
I can see that friendships initiated should be my variable,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.180
rather than friends initiated. Running this code, we can see

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.250
our scatter plot. Now, I still get this discreteness with

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.080
age, so I'm going to jitter our points. Here, I'll use an

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.670
alpha set to one tenth, so I'll need ten points

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.970
to make just one of these. That's looking a little bit

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.590
better. Another way to jitter the points is to still

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.390
use geom_point. But then to set the position equal to jitter.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.710
This code will produce the same plot that we have here. Let's

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.680
run it to be sure. Sure enough, we have the same plot.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.090
And since I still have really high values for some of my

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.590
friendships initiated, I'm going to use a cord transformation and take the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.460
square root of the y axis. When I add the cord trans-layer

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.670
and run this code I see that I get an error message.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.400
This should make sense since some of my friendships initiated have a

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.610
count of zero. So, when I take the square root of that number

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.100
with some noise, it might be negative which would be

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.210
an imaginary result. So, I'm going to fix this code like we

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.860
had before, so that way we have the positions set equal

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.244
to h equals 0. So, we'll set position equal to position

00:01:28.244 --> 00:01:31.810
jitter and we'll pass it h equals 0. This is

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.030
the plot that I came up with. Now, you might have

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.380
had something slightly different, or you might have even used a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.770
different transformation. Whatever you found,

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.650
and whatever your observations may be,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.330
share them in the discussions. We'd love to hear from you.
