Before we jump into a bunch more practice problems, let's look at one more

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:08.584
instance of a domain that is restricted because of what make sense. Just like

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:12.670
Athena couldn't make a room with negative dimensions. Let's look at this

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.430
function, A of r that describes the area of a circle with radius r. We have the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.770
function A of r equals pi times r squared, so if this is our circle that we're

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.390
considering, the radius is this length, from the center of the circle out to its

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.396
edge. What I'd like to know is what the domain for this function is. Is it all

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:36.768
the real numbers, r is greater than equal to 0, r is less than 0, or r is not

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:37.908
equal to pi?
