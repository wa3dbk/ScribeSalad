00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.710
You've done some idea validation, and

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.110
now you know about designing
an awesome user experience.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.550
We're going to show you how to use
design sprints to put the product in

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.030
front of your users.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.940
&gt;&gt; The founder of LinkedIn,
Reid Hoffman, once said, if you're not

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.390
embarrassed by the first version of
your product, you launched too late.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.860
We want you to take the same advice
when it comes to putting a product

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.860
in front of your users.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.040
It can be nerve-wracking to test your
product, but it's also super important

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.680
to learn quickly and
keep iterating on your product.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.970
Let's get started by hearing how
other start-ups have done this.
