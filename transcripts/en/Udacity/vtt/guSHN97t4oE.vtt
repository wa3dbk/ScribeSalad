00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.295
Well one thing you might have noticed, is that the three numbers here, log base

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:07.886
10 of 1, log base 10 of 10, and log base 10 of 100 are all integers for the

00:00:07.886 --> 00:00:14.731
outputs. The three numbers here, log base 10 of 2, log base 10 of 20, and log

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:21.950
base 10 of 200, all end in the same decimal, which I've rounded to 0.30102. So

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.678
now we've looked at the numbers to the right at the decimal point. But what

00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:30.488
about the numbers in front of the decimal? Let's just focus on these numbers

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:39.464
for a second. Let's say that log based 10 of 2, or 0.30102, is equal to x. I'd

00:00:39.464 --> 00:00:44.300
like you to rewrite these other two numbers, log base 10 of 20 and log base 10

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.839
of 200 as sums involving x.
