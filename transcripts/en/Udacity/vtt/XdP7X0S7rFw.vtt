00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.820
To get t by itself we first need to add 2 to both sides. Then we just need to

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.086
divide both sides by 3. So now we have t equals 1 third times log base 2 of 3

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:15.370
plus 2. Well what do we do with this? We know that we want to find out what

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.130
number this is equal to. But our calculator doesn't have a button for log base

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.450
two. That means that we need to convert this log base two of three into

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.250
something that's either a natural log or a log base 10. I'm feeling in a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.690
natural log mood. So let's do that. Know that log base two of three will be

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.730
equal to the natural log of three. Over the natural log of 2. So, let's

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.500
substitute this into this spot. OK, so now we have t equals 1 third times the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.370
natural log of 3 over the natural log of 2, plus 2. This is calculator

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.040
appropriate, so let's pull out the calculator. I am just going to enter all of

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.540
this in. I have 1 third times the natural log of 3 divided by the natural log

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.239
of 2. Plus 2. And here's what that equals. T is about equal to 1.195. Awesome,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.770
we went through a ton of steps to get to our answer, but we did arrive there

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.080
eventually. And along the way you got to practice a ton of different techniques

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.269
that you've learned throughout the entire course. Awesome job.
