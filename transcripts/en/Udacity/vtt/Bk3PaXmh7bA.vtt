00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer is you can. It must be 1100.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The way to see that is if you look at the x values, there are three that match 0111.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Those must correspond to the output where x = 0,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because we know an AND gate has three outputs that have a value 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then there's one that has the value 1011

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that must correspond to the x value having the output 1,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and that means the only way the output could be 1 is if both of these represent 1.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That means we know the value of b1. That's this one.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The value of b0 must be the other one, which is 1100.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We can, in fact, deduce all the lines in the truth table from this pattern.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So obviously this doesn't work.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We're not hiding in the patterns that are inherent in the logic functions we're computing

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
by replacing them with random numbers as we have to do something so this table is harder to see.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And what we have to do is make it so the outputs are encrypted,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so that we can't tell the values of the other entries in the truth table.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We can only tell the value of the one that we actually evaluate

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and that hides whether it matches any of the other values.
