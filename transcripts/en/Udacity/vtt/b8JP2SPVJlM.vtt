As teens we start to identify less with our parents, and we may even reject

00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:07.759
them. Or at least their social beliefs and opinions. And we start to agree more

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.509
with our friends and our peers. Of course, a major focus of our teenage years

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.824
is on sexual relationships, whether that be reality or fantasy. Sexual thoughts

00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:20.935
occupy a lot of a teenager's mind, and it's really common for teens to talk

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:24.249
about sexual relationships with their friends.
