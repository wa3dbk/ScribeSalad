00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:03.069
So the first algorithm that we're going to cover today is called reduce.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:06.282
So an example of reducing a set of numbers, for example,

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:11.092
is adding up all the numbers in this set to get a total sum.

00:00:11.092 --> 00:00:15.659
Reduce is an interesting algorithm because it requires cooperating between processors.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:22.507
So here we have a tree that we can use to compute the sum of a large number of integers.

00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:28.303
And so it's interesting because we now have dependencies between the operations.

00:00:28.303 --> 00:00:32.054
First, we add 1 and 2, and we have to take the result and then add it to 3.

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:36.349
Then when we have that sum, we can take the result and add it to 4 and so on.

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:39.850
So we now have dependencies between the operations that we need to do.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.761
And we haven't looked at any algorithms that have this behavior before.

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.661
Reduce is also interesting because a parallel implementation,

00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:48.425
like the one that we're about to describe,

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:53.002
will have a smaller and a better number of steps than a serial implementation.
