00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.148
So going back to the shower handle example, what do you think secondary

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:06.900
appraisal would look like in this situation? Well, I can tell you from first

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.253
hand experience. When the shower handle broke off in my hand, I had a really

00:00:10.253 --> 00:00:13.157
stressful response, thinking about everything I had to do to have someone come

00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:17.834
in and fix it. But then, when I took a step back and looked at the bright side,

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.562
I realized just how lucky I was that the shower handle didn't come off when I

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:25.040
had soapy hair. I can get new shower fixtures, and I have a reason to make time

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.688
to clean my apartment. Now, this may sound like a mundane example but I think

00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:32.860
it nicely shows, how different people respond differently to stressful

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.383
situations. And how engaging in secondary appraisal, can help to alleviate some

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:41.530
of the negative emotional responses we experience from primary appraisal.
