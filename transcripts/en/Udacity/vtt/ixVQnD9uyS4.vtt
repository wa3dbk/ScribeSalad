00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.200
The semantics of sending a message
versus calling a function, is related to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.980
what happens behind the scenes in
Objective C when a method is called.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.410
The method, object message send,
which belongs to the NSobject class,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.500
is called every time a message
is sent to an object.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.870
Object message send is
not called until runtime.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.660
Consequently the relationship
between the message and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.610
the receiver is not
resolved until runtime.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.915
This is in contrast to what happens and
swift.

00:00:26.915 --> 00:00:31.340
In swift, a function call binds
a particular implementation of a method,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.575
to a particular instance
of a type at compile time.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:38.900
Then the message and its receiver
are not bound until compile time is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.920
the principal difference between sending
a message and calling a function, but

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.205
for our purposes, it's primarily
just a difference of vocabulary.
