00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.459
The correct answers were negative 2 3rds and positive 3 halves. Fantastic work

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.050
if you found these two answers. Factoring is one of those important skills that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.600
will come up again and again, so let's make sure that we know how to do this.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.738
I'm going to subtract 5x from both sides and 6 from both sides. I perform this

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:23.642
same operation on both sides and I'm just showing these two steps I want. This

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:29.109
leaves me with 0 on the left and 6x squared minus 5x minus 6 on the right. I

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.387
also know I want to subtract on both sides here since I want the x squared term

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:37.952
to have a positive coefficient. It's generally easiest to factor when this term

00:00:37.952 --> 00:00:42.920
is positive. So, I've taken my equation and I've rewritten it up here to factor

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.912
this part of the equation we need to find the factors of negative 36 that sum to

00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:52.544
negative 5. These numbers are negative 9 and positive 4, so we can rewrite our

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:58.208
middle term and factor it by grouping. This gives us factors of 3x plus 2 and 2x

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:02.544
minus 3. Now that the right-hand side of our equation is factored, we can use

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:06.911
the zero product property and set each factor equal to 0. Solving for x in this

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:11.990
equation will get x is equal to negative 2 3rds. And summing for x in this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.346
equation will get x is equal to 3 halves. The last thing we want to do for our

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:20.654
solution set is to make sure we check the excluded values. We know for these

00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:25.757
denominators, x cannot equal 0 or else we would have fractions that would be

00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:30.282
undefined. Since both of these values are not 0, we can rest assured that this

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:31.599
is our correct answer.
