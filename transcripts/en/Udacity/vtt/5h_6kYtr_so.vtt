00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.010
The distance between the two points is the square root of 74. Great problem

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.470
solving if you found it. We'll start by drawing a rough sketch on the points on

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.995
the coordinate plane. If we want to find this distance between the two points,

00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:18.115
we set up a right triangle in two dimensional space. The horizontal distance

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:23.651
goes from x equals negative 2 to x equals positive 3. So, we know that this

00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:27.872
distance is a horizontal distance between the values of negative 2 and positive

00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:32.785
3. Which is the total distance of 5 units. For this vertical distance we

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:36.782
want to find the difference between the y values or the change in them. We

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:42.322
start at y equals negative 3, and we climb all the way up to y equals 4. This

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:48.414
distance, so we know that this distance is 7 units. Keep in mind that the

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.742
distance on this vertical axis, or between the y coordinates, is the same out

00:00:51.742 --> 00:00:57.194
here. This is a vertical distance that's the same as this one. So, we'll have

00:00:57.194 --> 00:01:00.914
the change in x squared, which is 5 squared, plus the change in y squared,

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:06.631
which is 7 squared equals d squared, our hypotenuse. Squaring these numbers,

00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:11.336
and finding this sum, will get 74 equals d squared. Now, we just take the

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:15.452
square root of both sides, keeping only the positive root. So, one d is equal

00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:20.218
to the square root of 74. Now, if we try to simplify the square root of 74, we

00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:26.568
notice that its factors are 2 and 37. These are not perfect squares, so we just

00:01:26.568 --> 00:01:30.223
leave our answer as the square root of 74.
