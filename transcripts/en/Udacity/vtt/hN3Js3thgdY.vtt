00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.517
Next let's calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true difference between

00:00:04.517 --> 00:00:09.611
pairs of shoes owned by males and females. Remember, this assumes that this

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:14.530
sample is representative of the entire population. In the last few lessons,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.266
you've learned that we calculate the bounds of the confidence intervals by x

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:23.558
bar, our sample mean, plus or minus the t or z-critical value times the

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:30.581
standard error. Well, now we have two independent samples so things change

00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:35.768
slightly. What do you think each of these values will be in this case? More

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:38.090
than one answer may be correct.
