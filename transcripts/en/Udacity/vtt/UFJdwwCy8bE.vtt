00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.190
My name's Chris Morel and
I work in social media marketing and

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.770
concept marketing for
the last ten years or so for

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.520
brands including FitBit, Clif Bar, Sony
PlayStation, and now here at Edacity.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.974
When you're setting
up your ad campaigns,

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:14.503
it's really important to think about
what keywords you're going to target.

00:00:14.503 --> 00:00:16.441
So if you're developing a fitness app,

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:19.063
it might not make sense to
target fitness as a keyword,

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:22.038
because it's really competitive and
might be really expensive.

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:25.535
It might make sense to target a phrase
like hit the gym, or go outside,

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:29.450
or something that might get you a little
better return, because the cost is low

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.326
and it's a little less
competitive with bigger brands.

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:35.120
You have to get creative
with keywords and ad terms.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.070
Five, six years ago, when these social
channels were really getting off

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.660
the ground,
things weren't quite as expensive.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.920
It wasn't a lot of competition
with big brands, but

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.090
now everybody's advertising on social,
so you have to start getting a little

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.870
bit creative with the keywords and
your campaigns to get better returns and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.680
to compete against people that might
be advertising the same words as you.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.420
&gt;&gt; When we're thinking about acquiring
new customers, we definitely want to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.780
make sure our key words are really
targeted to your audience, so

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.872
you want to keep them long-tailed too.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:17.648
If you start bidding on really broad
terms, where we're thinking more

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:22.240
father up in the buying cycle or
the buying funnel, right?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.270
So you want to be capturing a user
who's about ready to download an app,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.970
for example.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.100
So maybe, for example,
it's a music app or music streaming app.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.990
You don't want to be targeting users
who are looking for Taylor Swift or

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.140
Taylor Swift music.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.780
That's going to be too broad,
and most likely,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.350
they're not going to be as likely
to convert or download that app.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.670
So you want to be thinking really
specific, like music streaming app,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.395
or listen to Taylor Swift
music on my phone, or

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:01.700
Taylor Swift music app,
something like that.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.970
So you want to get really down to those
long tail terms when you're acquiring

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.590
new users off search because you want to
think about how people behave on search,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.460
both google.com and Google Play.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.120
They know what they're looking for,
and so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.740
you want to be present only when they're
most likely to download that app.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.930
The other thing you want to keep
in mind is making sure your

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.010
ad creatives are relevant
to your keywords.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.020
So if I'm searching for Taylor Swift
music, ideally I see an ad that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.760
says listen to Taylor Swift
music 24/7 or something.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.120
So having that relevancy really makes it
more likely that your ad will perform,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.870
that it'll drive more downloads,
capture the user's eye, and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.000
you also want to make it clear what
the action is, so in any ad creative,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.550
you want to say download today or
download the app now.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.520
Something really simple like that where
the user knows if I'm going to click on

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.420
this ad, it's going to be very
clear what the action is.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.607
And it'll make it easy for
me to download the app or

00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:18.307
register for your product or
your service.

00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:21.335
So yeah, those are the things you
want to keep in mind is keeping

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:24.842
the keywords in the ads relevent and
then ultimately the landing page.

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:29.426
So obviously if I'm looking to
download or stream music or

00:03:29.426 --> 00:03:33.167
sign up today,
hopefully when I click that ad,

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:37.843
it takes me to the registration
page where I can register for

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:42.230
your product, or
I can download that app right then.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.280
So the most ideal experience would,
say on my phone,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.150
I'm going to search on my phone and
listen to Taylor Swift music on an app,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.810
see your ad, click on the ad,
then it takes me to Google Play Storem,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.800
and I can download the app and
start then using it.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.420
AdWords function as an auction,
so if a user is looking for

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.380
a certain type of product, usually
they're going to see multiple ads, and

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.600
you might wonder how do I make sure
that I show in the top position, or

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.200
at the top of the page,
or even on that page.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.420
So all of that comes down to how
well your campaigns are set up, so

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.750
you want to follow those principles
that we've been talking about and

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.520
have really tightly themed keywords
that are most relevant to your product,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.810
keep your ads really
relevant to your keywords,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.360
and then ultimately your landing
page is really relevant.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.410
So all of that comes into play, but then
ultimately, you can use your bid to,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.140
so this would be how much you're willing
to pay for a user to click on your ad.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.650
So there are a number of factors
that determine which place your

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.640
ad is within the auction.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.070
So which position your ad will
be within the Google results.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.040
Two of those main factors that we
know of, it is an algorithm so

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.490
we don't know all the factors that go
into play, and that's part of Google's

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.710
secret sauce is just keeping it fair so
that no advertiser,

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.280
one advertiser can play the system, and
know how to place their ad at the top,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.410
but we want to make sure the best ads
are showing for every search query, so

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.160
the way that we determine that
as Google is two major factors.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.760
One is quality score and
the other is your bid.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.490
And so quality score,
we'll talk about that first.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.210
It's a score that combines
the quality of your ad, and

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.610
the quality of your keywords, and
the quality of your landing page.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.740
So that's why we talked about why
those three are so important in your

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.870
campaign set up, because you really
want to make sure you have a quality ad

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.720
that really is descriptive of what your
business is, of what your product is.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.570
And that the landing page does
actually direct to your business.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.020
So all of that goes into play
in creating a quality score,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.960
which is attached to every
one of your keywords.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.920
So then when a user searches
a term that triggers your keyword,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.910
that quality score comes in to play.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:20.090
As long as everything is in place and
you have a high-quality setup,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.510
then the next thing that the auction
will look at is your bid, and

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.650
your bid is how much are you
willing to pay per click.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.690
Now every advertiser can set that
individually per keyword and

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.410
say I'm willing to pay,
let's say I'm willing to pay $0.30 for

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.010
a user to click on this ad.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:48.690
Now maybe my competitor is willing
to spend $0.20 for a click.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.206
Now my competitor might have a lower

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:58.323
quality score than I do and
in that case,

00:06:58.323 --> 00:07:03.440
the combination of the quality score and

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.670
the bid will win out the auction.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.519
So the advertiser will get the first
position with the best quality score,

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:14.140
and the best bid.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.010
Now as far as bidding goes, you only
have to pay the amount that'll win

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.680
the auction or beat out the next
advertiser competing with you, so

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.350
if my competitor was bidding $0.20, I
was bidding $0.30, but I had the better

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:35.150
quality score, I'll only have to pay
$0.21 to beat out that other advertiser.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.760
That's why Google functions as
an auction to make it more fair for

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.280
advertisers to decide how much
are they willing to pay, but also,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.050
you don't have to pay more than
the market price per click.
