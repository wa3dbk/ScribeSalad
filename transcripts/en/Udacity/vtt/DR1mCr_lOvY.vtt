00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.210
So can say that from when computing the ILP.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.980
We completely ignore false dependencies among data dependencies. And

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.050
only consider true or flaw or read after write data dependencies. So

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.860
ILP really only looks at those data dependencies but

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.490
there are two other types of dependencies in addition to data dependencies.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.740
There are structural dependencies and control dependencies.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.590
How do they affect ILP? And the answer is that first of all,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.590
when looking at ILP, there are no structural dependencies.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.760
Structural dependencies occur when we don't have enough hardware to do

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.770
things in the same cycle. When computing the ILP, we're assuming ideal hardware,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.230
and as part of being ideal, it has no structural dependencies.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.460
Meaning, any instruction that could possibly execute in the same cycle,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.490
will execute in that cycle, and not have to wait. On some resource, like for

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.760
example, there being only one adder, so we can do only one add in a cycle.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.220
We can assume that we have an infinite number of adders, so

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.570
if we want to do an add, we do it. For control dependencies,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.620
we assume that we have perfect same-cycle branch prediction.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.640
Meaning that branches. Are predicted in the same cycle in which we fetch them.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.090
So we see all the correct instructions after the branch,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.120
in the same cycle in which we see a branch. Let's see an example of this where

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.310
we have a program that has a flow dependence, and also an output dependence. And

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.100
then we have a branch that has a flow dependence. On R1 and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.940
branches to label, if the condition is satisfied otherwise continues on.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.390
And after the branch in the program you have,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.970
an instruction, and at the label we have another instruction. So

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.370
now let's see how we compute isle B here, and these are again cycles. So

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.050
what happens is, in the first cycle we can definitely do this.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.180
We cannot do the MUL in the first cycle, because it, it depends on the add.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.280
So we will have to wait until the second cycle to do it. The branch can actually

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.610
not be done until the third cycle, because that's where we compare this.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.450
Now let's say that this branch is actually taken. What we can assume is that.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.900
Although the branch cannot execute until the third cycle from the beginning.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.790
Since we started fetching the program, we know what the branch is going to do.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.970
So we know that the branch is going to go to the label. And thus this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.130
instruction, because it has no data dependencies on any other instruction, will

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.440
actually execute in the first cycle. Although it has a control dependencies. So

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.540
as you can see, not only are control dependencies not resulting in any delays

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.540
after the branch happens. Actually, we are assuming perfect branch prediction,.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.900
And that means that this branch is predicted, even before it's executed, so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.540
that we can just do depend on the instructions. Pretty much,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.624
we can completely ignore Control Dependencies. The Branch acts as an instruction

00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:10.860
that simply produces no results. So it eventually has to execute but

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.430
it has really no impact as far as the line Other Instructions is concerned. So

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.770
in this case, not only does the multiply instruction execute.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.493
Even before the branch on which it has a controlled dependence executes.

00:03:24.493 --> 00:03:28.374
Also the instructions at this MUL will feed values to who can execute before

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:33.640
the branch. So pretty much a branch itself might be delayed because

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.310
of true dependence. But it's control dependencies on that branch have absolutely

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.190
no impact on what the IP will be. Because we are assuming perfect branch

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.550
prediction where all the branches in the program are perfectly predicted.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.650
In the same cycle. As soon as we begin fetching the program. And

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.330
from the beginning of the program, we knew exactly which instructions will

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.580
execute. So that we can just do them according to data dependencies
