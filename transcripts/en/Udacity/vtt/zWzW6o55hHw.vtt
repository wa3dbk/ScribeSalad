00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.620
So let' say I'm a proxy, and I want to put a key value pair in the coral DHT.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.690
I'm going to use the key-based routing algorithm to place the key at an

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.930
appropriate node. What does that mean? Well, I'm

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.440
going to take the key, and even if I

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.380
have the node ID that is equal to this key, I'm not going to go to him directly.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.090
Remember that, the Coral, key based routing algorithm

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.240
reducing the distance by half. So I'm going to

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.510
go to a node that is half the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.840
distance to the desired destination. So the desired destination

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.530
is n. I'll go to a node that is half the distance, say n over two, n over

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.950
four, and so on, til I get to the desired destination. And as I'm going,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.290
making these calls, saying that, well I'm

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.890
progressing towards this desired destination node, using that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.380
key base routing algorithm that uses the XR

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.030
distance between the source of the destination halving

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.610
the distance at every step. What I'm going to ask is, are you loaded or full?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.230
These two states that we talked about. And this guy says, no I'm not loaded or

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.440
full, and here is the next hop you can go to. So I keep going for, forward. And

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.250
if none of these guys say that they are loaded or full, I would

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.290
eventually reach my desired destination and place the key value over

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.360
there. However, when I do this hop, going

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.060
from hazardous to one fourth of this and so on, somebody along the way

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.110
may say that, look for this particular key

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.710
that you're trying to place. I'm already full, all

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.930
loaded, one of those two conditions is already

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.590
applying to me. So this node responds back to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.640
me and says, I am either loaded, or full. If that is the response I get back,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.070
then what I'm going to infer from the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.260
response is that the rest of the distance going

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.610
toward the destination is all clogged up, because

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.220
of the tree saturation. And therefore, I'm not going

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.430
to even try to place the key value pair

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.340
at the destination, at the desire destination. And not

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.520
even at this guy because he's also loaded and

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.330
or full for the same key. And so I'm

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.540
going to retract my step and choose this node

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.120
as the node to place the key value pair.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.750
So in other words, when I do a put operation,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.170
there are two phases to it. The first phase is

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.000
the forward phase. In the forward phase, what we are

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.410
doing is, we are going to the guy that is half

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.540
the distance to the desired destination asking him are you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.790
full or loaded. He says, no, I am not. Then

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.190
you go to the next guy who is even closer

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.070
to the desired destination. He says, he's not full or loaded.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.270
Then you go to the next guy, who

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.410
is even closer. Using that, key based routing algorithm

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.690
that I described to you earlier. So keep

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.640
going till you hit a node, that is either

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.780
loaded or full. At that point you know,

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.010
you don't want to go any further towards the desired

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.220
destination because all of these guys are either loaded

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.760
or full, dealing with this particular key. And therefore,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.360
the second phase of the algorithm that I'm

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.000
going to use, is retract my steps and go

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.121
back, and ensure that, that this guy is still

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:38.420
willing to host my key value pair. Why would

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.580
he change his mind? Well, between the time

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.650
that that I am making this forward motion it

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.430
is possible that this guy got either full or

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.150
loaded. So I'll recheck the condition. It says still

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.445
I'm good to host your key value pair,

00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:56.010
I'll choose this node for the Put operation.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.050
That's how the Coral Put operation works. So you can see that we are not storing

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.140
the key in the desired destination, which should

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.490
have been the way a greedy algorithm would

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.770
have worked. But in the sloppy algorithm of

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.810
Coral, we choose an appropriate node that is neither

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.785
full nor loaded, so that it can entertain requests for

00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:24.820
retrieving this particular key value pair. So we've avoided the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.840
meta server overload by doing this key-based

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.990
routing in the forward path during the put operation. So the get operation

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.040
is going to do exactly similarly. That is given a key that I'm looking

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.890
for, I'm not going to go directly to the destination that might be hosting it,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.436
as would happen in the greedy approach. But instead, what I would do is go to a

00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:58.550
node that it is half the distance to the key I'm looking for. And when I do

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.160
that, my hope is I'll find the key somewhere along the way. Because some guy may

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.260
be serving as the meta data server for that particular key. If

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.290
not, I will go, to the, destination. If nobody has retrieved

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.286
that key before, it will be available at the desired destination. I'll get it

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:25.488
from there. But the hope is that, if, a content is popular

00:05:25.488 --> 00:05:30.798
enough, then, multiple people, multiple proxies

00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:37.516
may have gotten the key value pair. And therefore, and they may have gotten the

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:43.211
key value pair, and in turn when they have gotten the content as well, they will

00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:49.010
have put their own node IDs as a potential node for the content. And so, our

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.570
metadata server, when we are looking for a

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.350
particular key may not necessarily have to be

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.740
the destination which exactly matches that key.
