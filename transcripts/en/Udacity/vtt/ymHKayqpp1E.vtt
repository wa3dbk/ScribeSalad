00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.100
So why don't we do gradient descent on y hat?

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.860
&gt;&gt; Well there could be many reasons but

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.800
the main reason is it's not differentiable. It's

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.560
a just discontinuous function. There's no way to

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.860
take the derivative at the point where it's discontinuous.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.580
&gt;&gt; So this this activation thing. The, the change from.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.570
Activation to y hat has this big step function jump in it, right, at zero.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.010
So once the activation goes positive, actually at zero. It

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.950
jumps up to one. And before that, it's, it's not.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.830
So the derivative is basically zero, and then that. Not

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.770
differentiable, and then zero again. So really, the zero's not giving

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.510
us any direction to push, in terms of how to

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.900
fix the weights. And the undefined part, of course, doesn't really

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.270
give us any information either. So this, this algorithm doesn't

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.770
really work, if you. Try to take the derivative through this

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.150
discontinuous function. But it does kind of, you

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.430
know. What if we made this, more differentiable? Like,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.760
what is it that makes this so undifferentiable? It's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.440
this, it's this really pointy spot, right. So you

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.160
could imagine a function that was kind of

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.270
like this, but then instead of the point spot,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.260
it kind of smoothed out a bit. Mm, like that.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.090
So kind of a softer version of a threshold,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.800
which isn't exactly a threshold. But it leaks this differentiable.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.150
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.160
&gt;&gt; So that would kind of force the algorithm to put its

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.720
money where its mouth is. Like if that really is the reason, that

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.410
the problem is non differentiable, fine.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.180
We'll make it differentiable. Now, how do

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.720
you like it? I don't know, how do we like it now [LAUGH]?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.050
&gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you how much I like it

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.740
when you show me a function that acts like that.
