Alright.

00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:04.856
So really, all you have to do is set ChainGun equal to Weapon.extend and in this

00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:09.253
case, we're not extending it with any further functionality. We'll be getting to

00:00:09.253 --> 00:00:14.389
that later. And similarly, we're defining Entity to extend Class, Teleporter to

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.988
extend Entity, and EnergyCanister to extend Entity. This bit of code doesn't

00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:23.722
really do anything by itself but we'll be adding more functionality to these, as

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:27.548
we go. And this way, we have a nice clean framework for doing that.
