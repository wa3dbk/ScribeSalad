00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.180
These are the attributes
that we care about.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.660
You might be wondering
why time is not included.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.750
The weather API provides the date and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.380
GMT time, but doesn't provide
time zones for the location.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.820
So unfortunately, the date could be
incorrect in some cases depending on

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.900
your location and time of day.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.570
Instead, for

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.200
a more accurate experience, we'll be
computing the date ourselves based on

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.150
the device time of when you fetched
the weather forecast from the server.
