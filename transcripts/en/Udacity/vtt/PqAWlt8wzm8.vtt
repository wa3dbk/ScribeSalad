00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.080
Dynamic memory allocation is another important service that

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.990
is part of memory management. It's important, once

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.870
again, to make sure that memory allocation scales

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.260
with the size of the system. And in order

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.750
to do that, one possibility is to take

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.080
the heap space of the process and break it

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.150
up. So this is the logical address space

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.710
of a multi-threaded application. And in the logical address

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.600
space, everything is shared. But what we're going to do

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.920
is we're going to take this heap portion of the

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.000
address space and break it up into the portion

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.220
of physical memories that are associated with the nodes on

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.530
which these threads are executing. Suppose the mapping of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.950
the threads of this particular application is such that

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.920
T1 and T2 are executing on N1. And T3

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.280
and T4 are executing N2, and it's a [INAUDIBLE] machine,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.250
so there's a physical memory that is local to this

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.020
node N1. And therefore what I'm going to do is dynamic

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.430
memory allocation requests. If it is centralized, it'll be a

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.209
huge bottleneck. Instead, we're going to break up the heap and

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.970
say that this portion of the heap fits in the

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.270
physical memory that is close to N1. This portion of

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.480
the heap fits in the physical memory that is close

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.920
to N2, so dynamic memory allocation requests from these threads,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.815
satisfied from here. From these threads, satisfied from here. That allows for

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.910
scale-able implementation of dynamic memory allocation.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.490
The other side benefit that you

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.500
get by breaking up the heap space into these distinct physical memories

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.590
that it can avoid full shading across nodes of the paddling machine.
