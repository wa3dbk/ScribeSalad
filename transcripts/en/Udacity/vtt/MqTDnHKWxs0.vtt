00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.620
Now that we know our value of e, or at least many digits of it. Though, not

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.812
nearly an infinite number of them. We can see how those numbers we had on our

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:13.195
table, introducing us to the idea of continually compounding interest.

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:18.194
Definitly do approach this value. There we're getting closer and closer to it

00:00:18.194 --> 00:00:23.678
as we moved on the list as n got bigger. And in fact, the formula for

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:28.002
calculating continuously compounded interest, does involve E. Here it is. So,

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:35.942
for continuously compounded interest, we have this formula. A equals p times e

00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:40.711
to the rt. As before, A stands for the total amount of money in the account,

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:46.355
after t years have passed. P is the principal amount invested in the account.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:53.504
And r is the annual interest rate. Remember, e is not a variable. It's that

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:57.286
very special number we've just discussed. What if we kept Grant's situation

00:00:57.286 --> 00:01:02.862
exactly the same as before. A principal of $20,000 and annual interest rate of

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:09.788
4%, but this time we let the interest compound continuously. How much money

00:01:09.788 --> 00:01:15.675
would he have after five years then? Don't forget to use our new equation And

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.913
please round to two decimal places.
