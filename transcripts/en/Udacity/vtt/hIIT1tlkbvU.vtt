00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.905
This graph that we just came up with, is different from other exponential

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:07.961
functions we've seen. Because it isn't growing. It's decreasing everywhere

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:13.086
instead of increasing. We call this exponential decay instead of exponential

00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:17.246
growth. We can see that the graph of an exponential decay function looks like

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:23.024
the opposite of an exponential growth function. It's going down instead of

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:27.927
going up, as you move from left to right across the graph. Now decay might

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.112
sound like a funny word for this sort of behavior, but it's called this because

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:35.844
of some of the context in which functions like this pop up in nature. We would

00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:40.060
use exponential decay equations to describe a panda population going extinct, a

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.131
giant group of bacteria dying off. Or the amount of medicine in the bloodstream

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:48.950
decreasing. Instead of having a growth rate like we have in functions like this

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.842
one. We have a decay rate. Thinking back to our original form of an expotential

00:00:54.842 --> 00:01:01.071
function f of x equals a to the x. What do you think that a needs to equal in

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:06.362
order for a graph to show decay instead of growth? What interval should a lie

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:06.820
in?
