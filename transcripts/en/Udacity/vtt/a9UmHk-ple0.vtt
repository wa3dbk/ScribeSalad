00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.910
Let's look at the answer to our
quiz about the relationship between

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.833
the block size and the miss rate.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:08.270
The question was,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.590
which of the three Cs are really
reduced when the miss rate goes down?

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.880
Obviously, some misses
have been eliminated.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.940
The question is which type
suffered the elimination.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.340
Let's first look at
the compulsory misses.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.430
If we have a small block size,
and this is our memory,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.580
we'll bring in this block and
suffer a miss for the first time.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250
We bring in another block and
suffer a miss.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.470
Now let's say we bring this block and
suffer a miss.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.280
If the cache line size was
twice of what it is now,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.650
then this second one would not have
been a miss because when we fetch

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.800
the first one, this second one would
have also been in the same cache block.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.160
So as you can see, the increase in
the block size, assuming there is enough

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.450
locality, will result in
a reduction in compulsory misses.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.240
Another way to look at this is to
note that we get the compulsory miss

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.370
when we access the block for
the very first time.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.090
Well, if you have larger blocks,
there are fewer blocks, so

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.790
there are fewer blocks to access for the
very first time, and that will guarantee

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.930
a reduction in compulsory misses,
assuming there is any spatial locality.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.300
Now let's look at capacity misses.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.040
Let's say that the program is accessing
a relatively large array that doesn't

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.150
fit in the cache, and then,
we go back and access it again.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.140
On the second set of accesses,
we're having capacity misses.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.390
The first set of accesses were
compulsory misses because these blocks

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.840
were never in the cache.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.460
Because they don't fit in the cache, by
the time we get to the end of the array,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.280
the beginning of the array is
kicked out of the cache, and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.430
now we're suffering capacity misses.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.282
These blocks will be in
that infinite cache,

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:59.060
they are not in the cache
because it was not large enough.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.010
But how many misses we will have for
this array depends on the block size.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.840
WIth smaller blocks, the size array
will be occupying more blocks.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.490
WIth larger blocks,
we will have fewer blocks.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.690
The number of misses will be
equal to the number of blocks.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.030
So as you can see,
if we increase the block size, and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.060
our miss rate goes down because
there is plenty of spatial locality,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.500
we are also reducing
the number of capacity misses.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.370
And finally,
if we look at the conflict misses,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.290
we can construct a similar example where
two blocks are kicking each other out,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.840
and because,
each time we fetch a larger block,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.710
if the block size goes up,
we will be having few conflict misses.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.480
So the increase in block sizes
can improve all types of misses.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.870
That is, it can reduce the number for
all three types of misses.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.100
When we increase the block size,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.550
the compulsory misses are almost
always going to go down.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.110
The capacity misses
are going to go down,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.740
as long as there is enough locality, and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.720
the conflict misses are likely to
stay similar, but might go down.
