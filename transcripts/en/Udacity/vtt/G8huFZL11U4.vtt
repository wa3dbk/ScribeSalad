If we want 0 to be a root, that means that we want one of our x-intercepts and

00:00:05.258 --> 00:00:11.177
also our y-intercept to be point 0,0. Right now, the y-intercept is at negative

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:16.847
10, or rather 0, negative 10 so that we want to move that point from being down

00:00:16.847 --> 00:00:22.044
there to being up here. That means, we need to move the graph up 10 units.
