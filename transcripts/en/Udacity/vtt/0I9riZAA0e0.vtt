00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.140
Okay, we are going to talk about a technique called

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.290
hashing, and hashing is a technique we can use

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.010
to verify the legitimacy of, of our data. So,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.010
what is, what is, what is hashing, what is a

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.300
hash. Basically a hash is, is, is a function,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.380
now let's call it H, that when you apply

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.985
this function to some data, you get Y. Now,

00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:24.665
so we'll say X is some data basically you know,

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:29.288
ultimately a number but you know, it's, it's you know how data is presented in a

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:33.350
computer. Most of our functions will be dealing

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.618
with string and it returns this value Y,

00:00:36.618 --> 00:00:43.270
which is a fixed length bit string. Usually you know on the the order of. Now,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.230
depending on the algorithm, 32 to 256 bits,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.900
you know, are the, are the the algorithms

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.306
we'll be dealing with. It, it can be arbitrarily

00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:54.910
length, but the, the kind of common functions we'll be

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.540
dealing with basically take X you know data X

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.850
of any size, you know, some big, long bit string,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.720
and returns a function, or returns a value Y

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.120
that is fixed length. and, and hashes have a lot

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.380
of uses. And they have a lot of properties

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.100
too. So let's talk about some of the properties of

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.230
this hash function H. Okay, so generally, a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.780
property of a hash function. A good hash

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.240
function H is that for a particular value

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.260
of Y. For a particular output. It's really difficult

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.720
to find an X that'll generate that Y. You

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.460
know there is, it's, it's very difficult to find a piece of data

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.340
that hashes to something specific. Likewise, it should be infeasible, you know,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.410
practically impossible to find a particular input X.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.570
For particular output Y. So if we hash some

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.300
value into some you know, other value Y. We

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.260
take that other value Y and we cannot reverse

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.470
this. This means it's a, a, a one-way

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.890
function. Another property of a hash function, a good

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.610
hash function, is you can't modify X without significantly

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.420
modifying Y, and. Generally you want if you just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.270
change one bit in X, which could be you know, thousands

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.870
of bytes long, you want Y to be completely different. And

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.260
again, this, this you know, kind of hinges on some of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.930
these other properties as well. But basically the whole idea is that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.160
for any particular X, you get a unique Y. You can't

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.000
get the X from that Y, and changing the X just a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.350
little bit gives you a totally unique Y. So, there's very

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.440
little correlation between X and Y. You know, each of these properties

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.890
has a vocabulary word associated with it

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.960
and some more rigorous explanation. And if you

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.550
would like to learn about those things,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.900
you should take CS387, which is applied cryptography.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.640
And this is you'll learn, you'll learn

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.660
about hashes to death, we're going to use hashes

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.234
quite a bit in this lecture because it's a really handy way of verifying data.
