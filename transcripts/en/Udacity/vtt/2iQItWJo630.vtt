00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This looks like a pretty harmless differential equation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We want the derivative of x with respect to time to be exrep as 1/2 and the initial value--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you know we have to specify the initial value to get one single solution and the initial value should be 3.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Implement the forward Euler's method for that differential equation and then experiment

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
what setting the ends time of that simulation, try to find out what the time of explosion

00:00:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of that solution is and use that in here with two decimal places as you submit the solution.
