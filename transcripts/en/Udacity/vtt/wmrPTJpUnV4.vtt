00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.770
In cycle seven, we no longer have any instructions to issue.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.810
So from now we will not be issuing things. Let's see what can we dispatch. Well,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.500
we have an instruction here that is ready and, we have an instruction here.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.400
They are going to different units, so they can actually both dispatch in

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.916
the same cycle. [SOUND] So now, both of these instructions have been dispatched.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:25.043
And we will, broadcast the result, but there is nothing executing currently, so,

00:00:25.043 --> 00:00:29.700
so we don't broadcast anything. So we will mark that the, subtract here,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.260
which is this instruction, started executing in cycle seven,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
is going to become eligible for, because, adds and subtracts take two cycles.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.730
So in seven and eight, this is ex, going to execute,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.250
is going to try to broadcast in cycle nine. The multiplication here,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.850
which is this instruction, also starts executing in cycle seven,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.890
is going to take ten cycles, so in cycle 17, it's going to try to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.710
broadcast the result. The other instructions are going to wait for these two so

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.423
basically. What that means is that, nothing is really going to happen now,

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:07.104
until the cycle in which one of these two tries to broadcast anything because

00:01:07.104 --> 00:01:10.840
dispatches are not going to happen because there is nothing that can go.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.140
Issue cannot happen because we are done issuing everything.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.540
So, we can now kind of fast forward in this, I mean cycle pretty much.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.020
Nothing happened except these two are executing. In cycle nine,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.810
what's going to happen is, this instruction's going to try to broadcast. And

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.640
because there is nothing else that wants to broadcast in this cycle,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.770
this broadcast will happen. So what's now going to happen is,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.450
this subtract is going to, find a register, that matches it's tag, which is F8,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.960
write the value, to F8 and the value's going to be minus 2.5 minus 7.1.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.740
So it's going to be minus 9.6. We're going to un-rename F8, so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.120
that it now forces future instructions to read from F8. We're going to

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.220
find instructions that are waiting for AD1, like here. And put minus 9.6,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.970
instead of the, tag. And then, we are going to, free this reservation station.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.534
Okay and the, the subtract, has been writing the result in nine.
