00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.556
So an initial plugging in of these numbers gives us this right here, which I'm

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:09.162
not going to read out because as you know, I'm pretty lazy. Anyway, now I'll go

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:13.502
through and simplify within each of these spots to figure out what numbers

00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:18.336
belong there. I'll leave that negative 5 out front. Under the radical we'll have

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:22.345
25 minus 24, which is just 1 and the denominator becomes 2. Awesome.
