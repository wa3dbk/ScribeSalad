00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.670
First things first, we need the jQuery object.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.740
So I'll start with the dollar sign and then I'll pass in a string of #nav.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.560
I'll go ahead and console.log(nav) to see if we're getting what we want.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.300
And I'll hit Test Run.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.700
Page shows up and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.160
I'll open up Dev Tools to see that we have in fact selected the nav.
