00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.560
The purpose of this lesson is not
to teach you how to do analytics.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.960
We've got other courses for that.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.590
Here we'll look at the end results that
are being achieved by aggregating and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.270
then analyzing data, at least in
part from digital health records.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.130
We're clearly heading into a new
era of medicine and healthcare.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.310
And this lesson's intended to
give you at least a feel for

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.550
what it might be like.
