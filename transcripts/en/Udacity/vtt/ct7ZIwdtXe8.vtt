00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.360
This led to the natural development where there was a goal of trying to unify

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.230
these various techniques together, which led to the Unified Modeling Language,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.260
UML. There's a, an industry group called the Object Management Group,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.940
called OMG. That is the home for this standardization effort.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.420
It's where you can find the specification documents,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.560
which I referred to you refer you to during the term.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.360
UML has also been championed by IBM. They acquired a company called Rational,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.670
which had developed a development environment called Rational Rose,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.630
which supported directly UML. There's lots of such case tools now.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.350
Aside from Rational Rose, one that we've used is Enterprise Architect.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.980
These are commercial tools. There are also all kinds of drawing tools out there,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.920
which you can get for free. UML, itself, had three main architects.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.855
One was Rumbaugh, one was Grady Booch, and the other was Ivar Jacobson. Okay.

00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:09.735
They're sometimes called the three amigos. They produced, in addition to

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:14.970
a unified modeling language itself, three books, a reference manual,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.840
a user's guide and so on. That had its main author as each one of the three, and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.550
then together. Conveyed the overall approach to UML. It's

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.580
important to note at this state the UML diagrams can be used both for design but

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.610
also for analysis. I'll try to distinguish as we go forward whether we're

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.200
talking about an analysis diagram or a design diagram. The main distinction is,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.390
analysis is concerned with the problem being solved and design is concerned with

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.390
the solution to that problem. I've taken some of these diagrams you're

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.840
about to see from the UML reference manual and from the UML users guide.
