00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right--so let's do some swapping. So, here's how it works.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We start out at the root where the problems is and we say "Okay."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, what's the smaller of the two children and that's the 25

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we're going to need to swap the 50 and the 25 to fix things up at the root.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We've bubbled that 50 down just a little bit.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But now, we've created--well, kind of things are okay over here but not so okay over here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, 50 is smaller than 56 but not in 26.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're going to have to swap 50 down with the smaller of it's two children.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, 50 and 26 are getting swapped. All right, so now, what horrible thing have we created now?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, actually, things are pretty good now.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This 50 is actually happy with respect to it's children, and if you're paying attention

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to what's going on elsewhere in the tree, everything is okay now, all right.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Because we didn't actually touched this sub-tree.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It had the heap property? It still has the heap property.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We've bubbled the 50 down into here but we only pushed it to the right.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We didn't mess with this sub-tree, so that one is still okay.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And now, for more it is right now, everything is fine.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We've now established the heap property everywhere and 50 ends up in node 4 here.
