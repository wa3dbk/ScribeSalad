00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.560
So, so far all the computation we've done

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.770
is operated only on numbers, and in the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.830
early days of computing, people thought of computers

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.900
as super powerful calculators, for doing computations like

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.760
simulating nuclear weapons, computing ballistic tables, or breaking

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.300
encryptions, which was a little more than just

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.230
arithmetic. But still was mostly about counting and

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.790
doing simple arithmetic. We saw this quote from

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.690
Grace Hopper earlier talking about computers could only do arithmetic, and

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.890
this is what people thought about computers in the 1940s and

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.990
1950s. But there's no reason to limit computers to that. They

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.620
can operate on any kind of data we want, and it

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.250
gets much more interesting when we operate on data besides just

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.250
numbers. If we're going to build a search engine, most of the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.800
data that we want to deal with is not numbers. It's

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.050
the letters that are contained in webpages, and in Python, that's what

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.454
we call a string. A string is just a sequence of

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:56.841
characters surrounded by quotes. So here's an example of a string

00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.529
in Python, it starts with a single quote, has a sequence

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:02.441
of characters and anything that we can type on the keyboard can

00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:06.030
be in a string, and ends with another single quote. The

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.890
string is the sequence of characters between the single quotes. If

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.600
we want, we can use double quotes instead. If we use

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.160
double quote, then the double quote starts the string. We can have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.670
a sequence of characters and a double quote that ends the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.600
string. The only requirement is that if we start the string

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.380
with a single quote, it has to end with a single

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.460
quote. If we start the string with a double quote, it

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.280
has to end with a double quote. And that's actually a

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.820
handy property. Because that means we can have the other kind

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.690
of quote within our string. This string starts with a double

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.390
quote. It contains a single quote inside it. But because we started

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.280
with a double quote, that single quote doesn't end the string.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060
That single quote is just like another character in the string.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.150
The string continues. Until the closing double quote. So let's try

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.150
some things in the Python interpreter. So, we can print a

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.680
string, just like we can print a number. So here I'm

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.170
printing the string hello. And when we run this, we see

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.780
the output hello. It's printing hello. We don't see the single

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.770
quotes as it prints, but we know that it's a string that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.860
was printed. We can print a string with double quotes,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.260
and one thing to notice when you enter strings through the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.440
interpreter, the color is black now, since it's an open

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.550
string, it hasn't been finished, once I type the final quote,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.820
that closes the string, the color changes to blue. So

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.210
now when we run this, we have two prints, both that

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.920
print hello, it looks the same both times. It doesn't matter

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.230
if we use single quotes or double quotes around our string.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.920
Just to check everyone's paying attention, I'm going to try one

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.340
more thing. And now I am printing hello without the quotes.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.420
You can guess what that will do. We won't make a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.010
quiz of this, but try to guess before I run it.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.200
Now that I run this, we see the result.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
We get a name error. The name Hello is not

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.040
defined. Without the quotes, this looks just like a variable.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.250
It's a name, but it's a variable that we didn't

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.150
define. So when I try to use it, I get

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.550
an error that the variable name Hello is not defined.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.530
If I wanted to I could define a variable named

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.590
hello. Let's make hello refer to the string howdy and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.790
now when I print hello, it works. I see the first

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.760
two prints that printed hello, now when I print the variable hello,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.380
well that refers to the string howdy and I see howdy as

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.450
the result. We usually don't want our variables to start with capital

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.510
letters. That's just a convention, so I'm going to change this

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.630
back to a lower case hello because it makes me feel uncomfortable

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.410
to have a variable with a capital letter. There's no rule against

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.980
that in Python. It's just a convention that we like to follow.
