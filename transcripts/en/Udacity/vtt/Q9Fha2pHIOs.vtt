00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.920
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Notice that I have y and y in both of these equations. That means I can

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.249
substitute negative 2x plus 4 in for y. This is my substitution step. Next we

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:15.689
distribute a positive 3 to negative 2x and positive 4, so I'll have negative 6

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.127
plus 12. Combining like terms, I'll have negative 1x plus 12 equals 10. I have

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:27.583
negative 6x's and positive 5x's. I have more negatives than I do positives, so

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:32.511
when I simplify here, I know that I'm going to need a negative number, a

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:36.692
negative 1x. So I have negative 1x equals negative 2. So if the negative of x

00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:41.672
equals negative 2, then the positive of x must equal positive 2. Some students

00:00:41.672 --> 00:00:45.632
think about multiplying both sides by negative 1 and others divide by negative

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:50.288
1. Either way is correct. We know x equals 2, but we're not done. We still need

00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:54.700
to find y. To find y, I'm going to use one of my original equations. I've used

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.426
the first one since it looks less complicated. Notice also that I didn't choose

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:03.868
to use this equation. I might have made a mistake when trying to find this

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:08.683
equation. That's why it's always best to use an original one. Plugging in 2 for

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:13.183
x, I'll have 4 is equal to 4 minus y, then I can subtract 4 from both sides to

00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:18.109
isolate my y. So 0 equals negative y, which means 0 also equals positive y. Any

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.818
number multiplied by 0 is still 0. So, if we multiply by negative 1, this should

00:01:23.818 --> 00:01:28.715
make sense. The point 2 comma 0 should be the point of intersection. If I use

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:33.619
some mental math real quick, we can check it. 2 times 2 is 4, and 4 minus 0 is

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.879
4. So yes, this one checks. Plugging in 2 for x and 0 for y, I'll have 5 times 2

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:46.157
which is 10. This term would be 0, so 10 equals 10. That's true as well.
