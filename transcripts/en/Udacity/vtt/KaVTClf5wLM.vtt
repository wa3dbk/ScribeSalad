00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The variance is a measure of how far the data is spread.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's really small if the data is centered around the mean,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and it's really large if the data falls far away from the mean.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here are two trees, and both of these trees have a couple of apples

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Of course, the apples at some point fall down.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When they're on the ground, then all of them are centered equally around the stem of the tree,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so if you computed the mean you would get back exactly where the stem of the tree is.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But on the wide tree, the spread is much larger,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
whereas for the small tree, the spread is much smaller.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can think of variance as a measure of how wide the tree is from which the apples fell down.
