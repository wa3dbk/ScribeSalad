00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.040
Without making any adjustments to this plot, I notice that

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.830
having more than 1,000 friends is quite rare. Even for very

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.900
young users we can see that this is where it

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.360
peaks, with the exception of this older crowd. And that the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.340
90 percentile is well below 1,000. You may have also

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.325
zoomed in on this plot using the coord_cartesian layer. To use

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:21.023
it, we need to get rid of the coord_trans and

00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:25.010
the xlim layers first. So I'll delete those lines of code.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.580
Adding in the coord_cartesian layer, we can just set the x and

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.020
y limits to whatever we think is appropriate. For our users, I want to

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.020
explore users between the age of 13 and 70. And for friend counts,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.920
the 90th percentile is a 1,000, so that seems like a good upper

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.640
limit here. Now it looks like I got an error and that's

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.760
because I forgot to add a plus sign after this layer. I want to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.890
add all these layers on top of each other. Now with this plot,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.220
we can see that we get a little bit more detail. For example,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.680
we can see that for 35 year olds to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.090
60 year olds, the friend count falls below 250.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.760
So 90% of our users between this age group

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.890
have less than 250 friends. At least according to Facebook.
