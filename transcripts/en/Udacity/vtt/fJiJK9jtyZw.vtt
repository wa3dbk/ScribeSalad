00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.775
For color textures, we saw that MIP mapping improved the quality of the images

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:07.800
produced. Noisy patterns were blurred out. Normal maps can suffer the same

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.300
sorts of problems with noisy sparkles twinkling on and off as we happen to

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.160
catch a normal that reflects light directly to our eye. Say we use MIP mapping

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.640
on the normal map here to avoid this problem. These bumps describe two ridges.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.634
We average neighboring shading normals to get the next level up. The topmost

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:26.900
MIP map will be a single normal that's the average of all the normals at the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.380
bottom. So, if the object is far enough away, and this topmost level is used,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.990
it will not look bumpy at all. What happens when the surface is far enough away

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.809
that MIP level one is used? The ridges disappear, the ridges become twice as

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.280
high, the ridges become half as high, or the ridges reverse their directions?
