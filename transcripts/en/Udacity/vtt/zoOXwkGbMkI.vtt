00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.534
Now that we've seen how to simplify rational expressions, let's use that

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:07.220
knowledge to help us multiply and divide them. But before we can multiply and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.304
divide rational expressions, let's think back how to multiply fractions. What

00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:15.770
would you get if you multiplied these two fractions together? Write your answer

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.183
here.
