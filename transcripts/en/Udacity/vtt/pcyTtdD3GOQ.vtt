00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.780
Angular is an open source framework.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.760
Created by Misko Hevery and
is maintained by Google.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.240
But what's so important about Angular?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.360
Why should you even care about it?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.970
Angular is a powerful framework.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.160
That can manage your entire application.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.660
If you don't want all that power though.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.040
You can pick and
choose from Angular's list of features.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.350
It doesn't force you into any
specific file structure or

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.170
way to organize your code.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.160
This can be very liberating.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.700
The downside,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.700
though, is that every Angular project
you work on could be different.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.030
So Angular let's you control the app
structure and capabilities.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.790
Keep in mind Uncle Ben's advice.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.560
With great power comes
great responsibility.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.840
Another one of Angular's awesome
features is two way data binding.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.120
Two way data what?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.120
Here's a trimmed down version
of how a template gets its data.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.060
Here's a data object that
gets fed into the template.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.850
This is a very high level overview, but

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.780
pay attention to name In
both of these sections.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.350
A typical framework retrieves the data
and displays it in the template.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.730
It's a one way singular
fetch of information.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.080
Angular retrieves its
data in a similar way.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.710
With two way data binding
the information you add, delete, or

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.930
change in the browser updates
the underlying data object.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.600
Why don't we take angular for
a spin and see how amazing it is?
