00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.282
In this assignment, discuss how you'd use case-based reasoning to

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:06.516
develop an agent that can answer Raven's Progressive Matrices. Make sure to

00:00:06.516 --> 00:00:10.040
describe how this is different from learning by recording cases alone. Where is

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.040
your adaptation phase? How are you adapting past solutions to the new problem?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.910
What is evaluation in this context? How are you evaluating the strength of your

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.870
answer? Are you going to record the cases that your agent encounters as they're

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.930
solving the test, or are you going to equip them with past cases beforehand for

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.740
them to use to solve new problems?
