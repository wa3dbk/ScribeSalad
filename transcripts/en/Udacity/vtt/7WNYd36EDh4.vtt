The hardest thing about solving problems is often just figuring out how to get

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:06.337
started. So let's start with a quiz. What's the first thing we should do when

00:00:06.337 --> 00:00:10.170
confronted with a problem like this one? The choices are start writing code,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.246
make sure that we understand the problem, search Google or Duck Duck Go, if

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:17.471
you prefer, for the answer, work out an algorithm that solves it. Check the one

00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:18.449
that you think is best.
