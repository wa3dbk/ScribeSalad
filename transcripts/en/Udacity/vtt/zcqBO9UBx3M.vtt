00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.410
Session Authentication, simply attempts to ensure that BGP

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.860
Routing messages sent between routers between AS's are

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.920
authentic. Now, this turns out to be a

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.390
little bit easier than it might appear, because

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.850
the session between these routers is a TCP

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.840
session. Therefore, all we have to do is

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.210
authenticate this session. The way that this is

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.600
done, in practice, is done using TCP's MD5

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.020
authentication option. In such a setup, every message

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.340
exchanged on the TCP connection not only contains the

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.730
message, but also a hash of the message with

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.840
a shared secret key. Now this key distribution is

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.860
manual. The operator in AS1 and the operator in

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.980
AS2, must agree on what key is, and typically

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.360
they do that out of band. For example, by

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.650
calling each other on the phone, but by calling

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.350
each other on the phone and manually

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.980
setting that key in the router configuration. But

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.490
once that key is set, all messages between

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.170
this pair of routers is authenticated. Another way

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.803
to guarantee session authentication, is to have

00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:08.110
AS1 transmit packets with the of TTL of

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:16.380
255, and have the receiving AS drop any packet that has a TTL less than 254.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.590
Because most [UNKNOWN] sessions are only a

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.040
single hop and attackers are typically remote.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.710
It is not possible for the recipient AS to accept a packet from a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.670
remote attacker, because likely that attacker's packets

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.930
will have a TTL value of less

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.070
than 254. This defense is aptly called

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.170
the TTL hack defense for BGP Session Authentication.
