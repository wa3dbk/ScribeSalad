00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.170
Here's our third practice problems for rationalizing higher order denominators.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.454
Now careful here, we don't have a cube root anymore. We have a six root. So

00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:11.678
think about what factors you need to multiply by or what powers these would

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:16.583
become in order to rationalize your denominator. Good luck.
