00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.158
Like reduce, scan takes an input array and a binary associative operator as inputs.

00:00:05.158 --> 00:00:07.934
You may recall that associativity was useful in reduce

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:11.315
to allow us to reorder operations to expose concurrency.

00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:14.427
And you'd be right in thinking that we're going to do the same thing here.

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:17.735
For completeness, I should note that all the operators we use in this class

00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:19.444
are also commutative.

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:22.801
X op y gives you the same result as y op x.

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:26.431
Implementations turn out to be a little bit more complex if you don't use that assumption,

00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:28.208
but we're not going to cover that here.

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:30.850
Now, scan also requires a 3rd input--

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.112
an identity value associated with the binary operator.

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:43.122
So for any operator, op, I op a, where I is the identity element and a is any value, always gives you back a.

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:46.260
For the binary associative operator addition then,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.993
the identity element is 0 because if you add 0 to any value,

00:00:49.993 --> 00:00:52.093
you get back that value.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.916
For the binary associative operator minimum,

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:58.091
the identity element is the maximum representative value.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.695
Consider an unsigned char data type, for instance.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:03.473
The identity element there is 0xFF,

00:01:03.473 --> 00:01:11.106
because min of unsigned chars between 0xFF and any value a will always give you back a.

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:17.156
So a little quiz to make sure we understand binary associative operators and their identity elements.

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:20.771
What are the identity elements for multiplication,

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:24.838
for the logical or operator, and for the logical and operator?
