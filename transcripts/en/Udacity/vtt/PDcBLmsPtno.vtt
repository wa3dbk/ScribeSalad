00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.064
A couple lessons back we've talked about
how their various types of request that

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:05.248
you can make to the server.

00:00:05.248 --> 00:00:08.286
And so far, we've talk
specifically about get request and

00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:10.668
then have seen how to use
them in our examples.

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:14.283
Earlier in this lesson, we mentioned
that we'd also be implementing what's

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:17.528
called the post request to add a feature
to our my favorite movies app.

00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:19.450
Now, it's time to look
at this in more detail.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.670
A POST request, as you may recall
is a request where the client

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.170
submits data to a web server for
processing.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.010
The data that's sent is enclosed in
the message body of the request,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.340
which can then be processed
to a specified resource.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.980
We'll use a post request to favorite or

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.540
unfavorite a movie in
the Favorite Movies list of our app.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.870
So let's go back to the movie
database's API documentation.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.490
By searching for the word favorite on
the API page, I found this method,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.740
which allows me to add or

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.150
remove a movie to an account's favorite
list, which seems like what we want.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.375
Now we'll click on the post banner
to open up the right-hand panel,

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.828
which has information on
how to set up this request.

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:03.678
Here at the top, we see the URL that
the POST request should be made to.

00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:07.390
In other words, that's where the
resource we want to update is located.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.230
Now, this section underneath that
is titled request should give us

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.100
the information that we need
to create this in code.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.070
These little drop down menus give
us a few additional options.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.908
Let's keep this setting as production
and this one appears to be

00:01:20.908 --> 00:01:24.828
a language setting, so let's set
it to Swift and see what we get.

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:29.098
Cool, this looks like stuff we can use
even if we don't know exactly what

00:01:29.098 --> 00:01:29.728
it is yet.

00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:32.678
But before we dig into it,
I feel like we missed something.

00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:36.358
What was this over here at the top
before we changed to Swift?

00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:39.618
Headers, we haven't
talked about that yet.

00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:43.389
So headers are actually a part of
an HTTP request along with the URL and

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:47.226
the message body, they allow us to
supply additional parameters that

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:49.518
specify how the request should operate.

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:52.618
Here we see that for this request,
two headers are supplied.

00:01:52.618 --> 00:01:57.531
The accept header field allows us to
specify which content types will accept

00:01:57.531 --> 00:01:58.458
in response.

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:02.360
In our case,
we want to accept JSON as our response.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.021
The content type header field let's
us specify what kind of content we're

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:07.078
sending in the body.

00:02:07.078 --> 00:02:09.173
In other words,
what format our data is in,

00:02:09.173 --> 00:02:12.698
so that the server knows what's coming
and can determine how to parse it.

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:15.578
There are many other types
of HTTP header fields.

00:02:15.578 --> 00:02:18.548
A list of them is linked
in the instructor notes.

00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:19.228
Awesome.

00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:21.288
Now, we understand what
these headers are for.

00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:24.110
Let's go back to this code and see if
we can understand what's happening.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.080
So this already looks a bit familiar, we
did this when making our other requests.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.144
Here, we are creating the URL and

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:36.368
then using NSMuteableURLRequest
to make the request from the URL.

00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:38.640
Now these lines are new,
but if you look at them,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.424
we already know what they're doing.

00:02:40.424 --> 00:02:43.133
Request.HTTPMethod = POST,

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:48.047
we're setting our request
method type to be of type post,

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:54.488
then request.addvalue application/json
for HTTP header field accept.

00:02:54.488 --> 00:02:59.308
This is just the code we need
to set up our two header fields.

00:02:59.308 --> 00:03:02.912
Now if we look back at what was
displayed when we had the language

00:03:02.912 --> 00:03:06.458
settings set to raw, there was
what looked to be a bit of JSON.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:13.026
"Media_type", "movie", "media_id",
550, "favorite", true.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.386
This seems like the information
we'd want to give the server, but

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:18.008
with our own values specified.

00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:21.284
So it looks like this little JSON piece
is here to show us what we should

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:21.908
be sending.

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:25.120
Let's look back at the Swift
code we're provided.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.158
Request.HTTPBody =.

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:32.699
So it looks like here's where
we want to supply that data,

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.518
the data that we want to post.

00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:37.458
This is where we should fill in
what movie we're talking about and

00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:39.390
whether we want favorite to be true or
not.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.680
Those can be variables that
we can put in our code.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.220
The rest of this is actually
all stuff we've seen before.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.480
Just getting the sessions,
making the task, etc.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.490
We already know how to do that.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.970
So when you make this POST
request in your app in Xcode,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.630
you should be able to copy over
most of the spoiler plate code and

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.210
only really need to change a few things.
