00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.550
The number that you would fill in, in these boxes, is negative 1 3rd. So,

00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:07.680
instead of thinking of dividing each side by negative 3, you could instead think

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:11.105
about multiplying each side by negative 1 3rd. Multiplying by negative 1 3rd is

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:15.172
actually pretty much exactly the same as dividing by negative 3. The reason for

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:19.691
this is because of fraction multiplication, and its relationship to division.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.650
So, if we have negative 3 time negative 1 3rd, we convert negative 3 to a

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:28.055
fraction of negative 3 over 1. Then, if we just do some fraction multiplication,

00:00:28.154 --> 00:00:32.399
so you mutiply the top by the top and the bottom by the bottom, we end up with

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:36.420
negative 3 times negative 1, or positive 3 over 1 times 3, which is just

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:40.785
positive 3 again. And 3 over 3 is just 1. So, multiplying by fractions is just a

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:44.880
different way to think about doing division. I want you to decide which way

00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:49.190
works better for you. Thinking of dividing this side by the coefficient that's

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:53.405
in front of x, or multiplying by its reciprocal. Either way is completely fine.
