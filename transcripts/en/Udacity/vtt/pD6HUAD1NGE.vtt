00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.589
Here's my solution.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.490
The initial state accepts
on the blank symbol.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.420
The empty string is balanced naturally.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.380
While encountering a 0, we move to
state q1, and go hunting for a 1.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.960
On encountering a 1, we move to
state q2, and go hunting for a 0.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.990
As we hunt for a 1,
we skipped past all the zeros and x's.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.750
And if we do find a 1, then we move on
to state q4, which will rewind for us.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.923
And we do the analogous thing for q2.

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:34.660
On the other hand, if we encounter
a blank instead of a 1, then we reject.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.250
There were no 1's to match.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.130
Or in this case,
if we're looking for a 0 and

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.000
encounter a blank instead,
that means that there's no 0 to match.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.090
Assuming we do find a match, we end
up in state Q4 which then rewinds.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.840
It moves left past all the Xs, the
zeros, and the ones until it finds that

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.460
blank symbol, which we crossed out
initially in this transition here.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.820
It exes that out and
then moves to the right, so

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.370
that we're ready to
process the next symbol.
