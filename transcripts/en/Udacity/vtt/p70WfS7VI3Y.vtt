We know equations are like scales. They need to remain balanced. The left side

00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:07.556
needs to equal the right. There are some choices we can make along the way to

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:11.451
help us with our math. Let's see what those are. I'm going to solve this problem

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:15.218
two ways. When thinking about solving this equation, I'm going to combine my

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.901
like terms on one side of the equation. So here, I'll have 3b plus 32 and then

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:23.219
on the right side, I'll have 2b plus 47. I've listed my equation twice, so now

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:27.759
that I can solve it two different ways. First, we can subtract 2b from both

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:32.029
sides. 3b and negative 2b make positive 1b. I have 1 times b here, but I don't

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.826
really need to write the 1. I can leave it off. The positive 32 comes straight

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:41.140
down, positive 2b and negative 2b sum to 0, so I don't list anything here. And

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:45.992
then, I have positive 47. In the end, b equals positive 15. But let's see

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:51.520
another way to solve this. I subtracted 2b first, but what if I didn't subtract

00:00:51.532 --> 00:00:57.204
the 2b, what if I subtracted the 3b? Positive 3b and negative 3b makes 0, the 32

00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:02.925
comes down, the 47 comes down and then 2b and negative 3b make negative 1b. And

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:07.315
subtracting 47, we get negative 1b is equal to negative 15. So, I'm not

00:01:07.327 --> 00:01:12.080
interested in the negative value of b, I want to know the positive value of b.

00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:16.800
So, I know if negative b is negative 15, then positive b must be positive 15.

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:20.845
that could also think about multiplying both sides by a negative 1, That would

00:01:20.857 --> 00:01:24.140
give us our result, b equals positive 15. So, when you're solving equations,

00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:27.920
it's best to look out for the variables. Do you want to keep your variable

00:01:27.932 --> 00:01:31.920
positive? Or do you want to make it negative? It's probably easier to work with

00:01:31.932 --> 00:01:35.895
a positive b variable here. Sometimes, we make errors with negative signs, so

00:01:35.907 --> 00:01:37.120
it's best to avoid those.
