00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.380
We need to replace y with y plus k, to shift the parabola y equals x squared,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.796
down by k units. This is exactly what we saw with y plus 3 equals x squared.

00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:16.335
Which remember was a translation of the graph y equals x squared down 3 units.
