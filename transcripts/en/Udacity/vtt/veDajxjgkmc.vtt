One answer is private String name. You might have used a different name for the

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.820
variable here. This declaration says that the variable is private, because it's

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.514
an instance variable. Its type is String, because it's literal text. And I gave

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:18.460
it the name, name, but maybe you came up with something different. As long as

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.662
it means something like name, that's good.
