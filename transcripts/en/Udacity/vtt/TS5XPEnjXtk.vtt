Each lesson in this course corresponds
to a chapter from my textbook,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.460
Contemporary Health Informatics.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.040
A link to purchase it at a discount
is in the instructor's notes.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.410
I also strongly suggest you
subscribe to E-Health Beat,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.760
a free, daily e-newsletter published
by the California Health Foundation.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.380
Just reviewing it each day will give you
a good understanding of what's happening

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.470
in health care and health informatics.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.250
There are also some other suggested
blogs and newsletters I recommend you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.080
refer or subscribe to, in order to
enrich your learning experience.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.820
You can find this
information in the text or

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.430
in the instructor's notes on this page.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.960
And it will also be collected
in the course materials page.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.880
Now let's get started.
