This research considered various
configurations of the beds in a surgical

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.470
suite and their impact on
the overall efficiency of the suite.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.790
Traditionally, there
are three types of beds,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.270
the pre operative holding area, where
patients are held before the surgery.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.310
The post anesthesia care unit where
patients go immediately after surgery,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.560
and the level 2 area, where they
recover further from the surgery.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.220
Georgia Tech researchers developed
a model using a tool called MED-BPM,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.210
a healthcare specific modeling tool,
and showed that an alternative approach

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.880
using universal beds that could be
reconfigured for all three purposes

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.790
could serve the same number of cases,
but with substantially fewer beds.
