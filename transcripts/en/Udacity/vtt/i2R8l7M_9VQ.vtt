00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.300
So let's do a VLIW target market quiz. So what type of

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.740
application is the VLIW best for? An application that adds up many numbers, and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.800
application that figures out the best path in some sort of maze, or

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.740
an application that often counts elements in a linked list?
