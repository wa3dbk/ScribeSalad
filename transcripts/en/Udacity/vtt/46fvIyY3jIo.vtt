00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.960
So, now that we seen Amdahl's law, let's do a

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.250
quiz. Let's say we have a program with 50 billion

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.403
instructions it executes. Let's say that we have a processor

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:11.602
clocked at two gigahertz. Let's say that we improved the branch

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:14.198
instruction so that it no longer takes four cycles to

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:17.400
do one. Now it takes only two cycles to do one.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.960
This is a table where we show for each of

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.960
the four instruction types, integer, branches, loads, and stores, the percentage

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.577
of all instructions in the program that are of this type. So, for example 40% of

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:35.564
all instructions that we execute are integer instructions.

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:38.984
20% of all instructions that we execute are branch

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:42.770
instructions. 30% are loads, and 10% are stores.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.030
And finally we have the CPI for each

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.500
of these types of instructions. For integer it's

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.280
one, for branches it was four. The improvement reduces

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.628
that to two. Loads spend two cycles

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:56.652
per instruction and stores spend three cycles per

00:00:56.652 --> 00:01:00.137
instruction. The question for you is, what is

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:02.800
the overall speedup, which you will answer here.
