00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.180
This center would be at the point 4 comma 3. This is a graph of the circle, and

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.160
we can see that the graph has been shifted 4 units right and 3 units up. This

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.067
black circle is the equation x squared plus y squared equals 25. It's a circle

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:22.945
with a radius of 5 units. And notice that it's center is at 0 comma 0. We'll

00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:27.986
we're really just shifting this equation. We're going to shift it right 4 units

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:34.745
since we have minus 4 and up 3 units since we have minus 3. So, this is how our

00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:39.825
center shifts from 0 comma 0 to 4 comma 3.
