00:00:00.522 --> 00:00:02.610
So we've gone through
a fair amount of code.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.220
Let's go ahead, and put it all together
in our database_setup.py file.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.800
Let me start with this
configuration code that goes at

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.610
the beginning of our file,
and put it where it belongs.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.060
I can also take this code at the end,
and put it at the end of the file.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.360
Next, let's put our two class
definitions, right where they belong.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.456
Next, we need to add
our table information.

00:00:20.456 --> 00:00:24.180
And finally, our mappers.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.530
Putting all this code together,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.710
should give us a Python file
that looks something like this.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.530
So, if we navigate to the directory,
where our database_setup.py file live,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.785
and run it using the Python command,
we should get something like this.

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:37.725
Looking in the same folder,

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.625
where we have our code,
we see a newrestaurantmenu.db file.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:43.365
This is our empty database.

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:45.015
Now that we have an empty database,

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:47.015
let's figure out how to populate
it with some information.
