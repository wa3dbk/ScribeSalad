00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.520
This example extends the UIView class
to enable a view to fade out and

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.810
fade back in.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.280
For this demo, we'll be looking
at a really simple Xcode project.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.190
Go ahead and download it from the link
in the instructor's notes, and

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.080
then open the project in Xcode.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.780
It's called FadeExtensionDemo.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.990
In this left panel,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.360
the project navigator,
click on the ViewController file.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.170
And then, look for
the sunrise and set method.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.495
Here inside sunrise and set,
you can see that I'm using the method,

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.610
animateWithDuration, to
fade out an image view.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.410
This animation changes the view's
alpha value from one to zero

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.040
over the duration that I
pass in as a parameter here.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680
This one is one second.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.710
There's also a delay parameter, so
we could pass in a delay if we wanted.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
Under the options parameter you'll
see we've passed in CurveEaseIn.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.950
This makes it so
that the animation starts out slow and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.690
speeds up towards the end.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.340
For the completion parameter,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.800
I'm passing in some code
that changes the image.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.690
And then, fades the view back in.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.890
Here's the code that changes the image.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.240
After the image is changed,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.130
we're using animateWithDuration
again to fade the view back in.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.250
You can see that this code for

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.670
fading the view back in is identical
to the code that phased it out.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.850
Apart from the alpha value and
the completion parameter.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.230
The syntax around this completion
parameter is pretty tricky.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.680
So don't worry if it doesn't
make sense right now.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.652
We'll talk more about completion
blocks in the next lesson on closures.

00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:26.440
I want to focus on another
problem with this code.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.910
Soon I'll have another view that I'd
like to fade out and fade back in.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.520
And I know I'd have
to rewrite this code.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.290
That goes against my dry
programming principles.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.610
But if I put this code in an extension,
I can reuse it.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.365
So let's do that, since I can't add an
extension directly to the UIView Swift

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:47.865
file, I'll make a new Swift file and
call it UIViewExtensions.

00:01:47.865 --> 00:01:51.445
To add a file to the project, I just
Ctrl+click on one of these folders,

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.705
over here in the project navigator,
and then I go to New File.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.676
Then I want a Swift file.

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:04.633
And again,
I'm going to call it UIViewExtensions.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.120
Here we are in
the UIViewExtensions.swift file.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.080
And the first thing you'll
need to do is import UIKit.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.330
To define an extension,
you just write the word extension

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.780
followed by the name of
the type you're extending.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.830
And in between curly braces,
the methods you'd like to add.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.870
The methods we'd like to add
are called fadeOut and fadeIn.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.300
Here in the fadeOut method,
we just want to copy and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.750
paste some of the code from
that sunrise and set method.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.850
So to do that we go back to
our ViewController.swift file.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.150
And then,
we want to copy this fade out code,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.360
this animateWithDuration code, up to but
not including the completion block.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.080
Once you've got
animateWithDuration pasted in,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.960
there are a couple snippets
of code we need to edit.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.463
Here where it says self.imageView.alpha,
we want to replace that with self.alpha.

00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:03.914
Because the object that's
calling this code,

00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:06.580
self is the object whose
alpha needs to change.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.720
Next, we need to make sure we're
passing in the necessary parameters.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.260
So we'll pass the parameters
duration delay, and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.995
the completion closure
into the fade out method.

00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:20.595
And then, we'll pass those
parameters again to the animate with

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:21.845
duration method.

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:25.785
So here, instead of one
second we'll put duration.

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:29.824
Here, instead of a delay of
zero seconds we'll put delay.

00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:33.172
And then, under completion,
we'll put completion.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.352
Notice that the animation option,

00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:40.252
CurveEaseIn is the same every
time fade out is called.

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.683
And so, is the animation
changing the alpha to zero.
