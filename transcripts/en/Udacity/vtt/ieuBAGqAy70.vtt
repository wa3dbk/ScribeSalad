00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.210
So far, we've mostly focused
on portrait phones, but

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.900
Android devices come in all shapes and
sizes.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.690
&gt;&gt; From smartphones to phablet's
to large and small tablet's, and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.350
beyond, to new formed factors
like watches, cars, and TVs.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.150
&gt;&gt; Android was built from the ground
up to not only embrace this variety and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.960
to make it easier to design
UIs that adapt to it,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.710
we introduced this notion briefly in
lesson one, but here in lesson five,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.160
we'll go much deeper into this
notion of adaptive design.
