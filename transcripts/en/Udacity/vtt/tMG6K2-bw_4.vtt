00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.166
So, it works to divide both sides in an inequality by the same number to get a

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:08.287
solution, or does it? What happens if we have negative x is greater than or

00:00:08.287 --> 00:00:12.761
equal to 4? Well, using the method we used before, we would divide both sides by

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:17.170
negative 1. And we'd find that x is greater than or equal to negative 4. If this

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.592
is right, then that means that this inequality up here, the original one we had,

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:26.252
is satisfied by any value of x that is greater than or equal to negative 4. Now,

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:30.217
last time I went through and I did a sort of sanity check, where I plugged in

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.206
some test values that fit the solution interval we've come up with. And I

00:00:34.206 --> 00:00:38.318
plugged them in to the original equation to make sure that my answer made sense.

00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:41.920
Now, can you do the sanity check yourself this time, and tell me if this

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.830
solution right here is correct? Just tell me, yes or no.
