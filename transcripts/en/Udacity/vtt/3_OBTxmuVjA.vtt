Please take a minute to look at the
placement of each letter. There are a few

00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:09.657
numbers you may have wanted to place in
several positions. For example, you may

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.592
have been tempted to write 3 as an
integer, as a whole number, and of course

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:19.452
a natural number. However, the correct
placement on the graph is for the number

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:24.665
to be placed in the smallest circle it can
be placed in. Remember, by placing a

00:00:24.677 --> 00:00:30.185
number in the smallest circle, you are
placing it in all of the larger circles

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.630
that surround the smallest circle.
