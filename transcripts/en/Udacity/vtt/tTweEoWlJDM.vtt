00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In Unit #3, we'll talk about bar charts, which is a common statistical data visualization tool.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's look at our housing data again.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This time I'll order the houses by size increasing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here are the associated house prices from $88,000 all the way to $98,000

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
for these different sizes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Just as a warmup, I'll ask you a quiz that really belongs to the last unit.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Is this data linear?
