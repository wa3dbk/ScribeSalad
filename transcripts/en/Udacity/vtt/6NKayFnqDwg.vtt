00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.378
The distance between the means for food A and B is three, and this is greater

00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:13.245
than 2.51. For B and C it's also three, and for A and C the difference is six.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:18.346
Therefore, all of the differences are honestly signifigantly different. If we

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:21.910
just looked at the means, we wouldn't know whether or not their differences are

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.025
simply due to sampling error, but now we can conclude that cows prefer food C.

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:31.953
Before we move on from Tukey's HSD, note that we can only compute this when the

00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:37.873
sample sizes are all the same, in this case they were all 3.
