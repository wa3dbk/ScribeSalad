00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] In this unit, we're going to talk about how to write a poker program.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is going to be an example of a general process

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
where we start with a vague understanding

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then we refine our understanding to have a formal specification of a problem,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
then we specify that into something that is amenable to being coded,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then the design process we end up with working code.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we'll follow these steps 1, 2, 3.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The first thing I want to do in the understanding phase

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is make an inventory of the concepts that we're going to have to deal with,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and so let's look at what we have.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
First we have this notion of hands.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
A hand consists of 5 cards, so here's an individual card,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and a card has a rank and a suit.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This card, the 5 of diamonds, the rank is 5 and the suit is diamonds.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The main program we're trying to specify we'll call poker,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and it takes a list of hands as input and returns the best hand.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What's the best hand? Well, you can see the rules of poker.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There are links to describe where we can look them up,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and we'll go over them briefly throughout the course of this video.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But we can say, for example, that this hand is called 2 pair.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
You can also say it's jacks over 2s with an extra 5,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and the rules specify which hands beat which,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which is the best ranking for each hand.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So this is another concept that we have:

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the concept of a hand rank which takes a hand and maps to something like,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in this case, 2 pair and maybe with some more details.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And what are the concepts that make up the hand rank?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There are 3.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
One is the concept of cards of the same rank, the same kind,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and we'll call that n of a kind for 2 of a kind, 3 of a kind, or 4 of a kind.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So here I have 2 of a kind in two 2s and in two jacks.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This hand is a straight--5, 6, 7, 8, 9--because it's 5 consecutive ranks.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Suits don't matter.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And then the notion of a flush.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This hand is a flush because all 5 cards have the same suit, and the ranks don't matter.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So there are a few more details about the ranking.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You can look it up on the links, see the Wikipedia article on poker hands.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But now I think we're ready.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We know about the types of data we have to deal with--

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
hands, card ranks and suits--

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and we know about the sort of operations or functions on them.

00:02:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now we're ready to move into the design phase.
