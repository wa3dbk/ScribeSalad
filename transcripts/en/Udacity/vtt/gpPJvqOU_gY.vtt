00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you did this a little bit carelessly, you might say that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the first number that goes into E is the length of the shortest hot path from A to E,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which in this case would be, well there's two ways to get

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the distance 11 to here in two hops and then another seven.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You might have said 18, but in fact, it won't expand D into E until it knows the shortest distance to D,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the shortest distance is going to be 10 because we can go this way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
four plus one is five and five is 10 so it should be 17,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but let's actually simulate and see what happens.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We expand out A into C and B and once we've done that,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the shortest non-completed distance is the one to C so we're going to lock that down

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and then we expand from that node C

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There is two edges to incomplete nodes, C to D and C to B.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The C to B has a length of one plus length of four, we already had

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that actually improves this one to five and a new node joins the picture, D

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and C to D is seven on top of the four we already had for a total of 11.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Alright, of the non-completed nodes, B and D,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the one with the smallest distance is B with distance of five.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We can lock that down and look at the outgoing edges from B,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which is just this one that goes to D which had the length of five

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
plus the five we already had for a length of 11 in D, which improves D, 10

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and this the only node hit that we can read at this point that we haven't completed yet

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so we can lock it down, expand out its neighbors, which are F and E.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
F gets 20 and E gets the 17 and not only is that the first number written in E but it is the final one

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because the very next thing we lock down is E's distance.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We don't lock down F's distance until we actually discover that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
there is a shorter path, the 19-length path.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
All right, so I think you understand this well enough that we can try to code it up
