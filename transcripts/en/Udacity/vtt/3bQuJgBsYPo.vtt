00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.330
So we talked to Rich Fulcher, a design-minded

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.460
developer on the Android team at Google. So

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.870
he's going to tell us a little bit about

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.635
personas and use cases, and basically blow our minds.

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:09.940
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.890
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Rich Fulcher. I started my career with a

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.510
Master's degree in Computer Science and was programming computer graphics for

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.280
quite a while. But then I switched over and I became

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.390
a designer. And now I'm a designer and manager as part

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.410
of the Android team here at Google. I think there's a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.950
huge temptation at the start of a project to just kind of

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.270
get going and do the thing you want to do the most. You

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.780
know, when you're a designer, you want to start drawing. When you're a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.150
developer you want to start building out those APIs, or start coding, or

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.310
kind of get to that first screen. But you want to temper

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.990
that, you can do that and it's okay to engage with that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.580
kind of passion you have for what you do, but you also

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.790
want to make sure that you're, you're building in the right

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.590
direction, the only way you can do that is to be aware

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.820
of the users. So you need to start thinking, you know, who

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.850
is this audience that I'm building this thing for? It can't just

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.920
be me, it's gotta be much bigger than that. So, how can

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.140
I understand them, how can I make sure that the things I'm

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.880
excited about, these use cases that I'm thinking about, really line up

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.930
with what their goals, and what the needs of the user are?

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050
So, one way that you can think about users

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.900
is through the use of a persona. You know, just

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.080
trying to build out your model of how this

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.880
person other than yourself, you know, one of your users

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.980
just more information about them and kind of what their goals

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.840
and what their contexts of use are. When you have those

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.490
personas the next step is to really think about well, how

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.260
do they act with your product? And one way you capture

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.570
that, them completing a task, is through a use case. You

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.100
know, what are the steps they go through to complete a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.370
specific sub-goal? So you have your personas, and you have your

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.310
use cases. How do they influence the way you treat development?

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.300
Well, something I do is I try to refer to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.100
those personas by name whenever I can. Or I try

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.100
to talk to the specific use cases. And if I'm

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.827
talking just about myself and my opinions, I'll make a

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:11.160
distinction by just repeating the word I. I'll say, well,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.540
I, I, I think this. To make a clear kind

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.450
of gulf between what I personally think, and what I

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.620
as a designer representing these personas, think should be true.
