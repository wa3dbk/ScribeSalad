00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.669
So let's talk about shapes as variables. Here are the two important points I

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:07.521
wanted you to think about. First, is that variables can be assigned a value and

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.319
replaced. Just like this circle. I could have had a triangle minus 5. I take

00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:15.175
this symbol, the circle, or this variable, and replace it with this assigned

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:19.291
value, of 5. The other important part, is that some variable are unknown. And

00:00:19.303 --> 00:00:23.622
there value can vary or change. This happened with my triangle, I can plug in

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:27.854
any number for my triangle, for example, the triangle can be 10, so that 10

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:32.185
minus, which would equal 5. Or the triangle could be negative 31 and I've had

00:00:32.197 --> 00:00:36.510
negative 31 minus 5, or negative 36. Or the triangle could be a 1035, and I

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:41.093
would get 1030. The triangle could take on any value. This is a powerful concept

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:45.273
in Algebra. The idea that a variable could take on any number. We'll return to

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:50.228
this idea later. For now, just remember that variables can be unknown. And the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.889
value can change or vary. Your probably not use to seeing shapes when doing

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.787
math. You're probably use to seeing x. Mathematicians have usually used x. And

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.532
it actually originates from the Arabic langauge, it means something unknown.
