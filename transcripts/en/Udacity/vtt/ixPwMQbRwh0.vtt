00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.740
So let's look at an example of deductive reasoning. So Premise A, is all mass

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.672
creates gravity. And Premise B, is all objects have mass. Therefore, all

00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:14.523
objects create gravity. Because if all mass has gravity and all objects have

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:19.710
mass, then they must create gravity. Notice that the logical conclusion has to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.811
be true if the 2 premises are true. We know, however, that this type of

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:28.587
reasoning can lead to correct conclusions only when the general premises to

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:34.360
which they are based are true. Let's look at another example. Premise A,is I

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.322
don't know math. Premise B is, I can't learn math. Therefore, I shouldn't even

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:45.050
bother trying to learn math". We see, here, that this reasoning leads to a

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.330
false conclusion, because premise A is false. And so is premise B. So, even

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.306
though the argument is. Easily structured in the same way. One leads to an

00:00:55.306 --> 00:01:01.558
accurate conclusion, and one, this one, does not. Deductive reasoning is what

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:05.878
scientists use when we make predictions for our general goals. Now let's go to

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:07.900
Susan and talk about inductive reasoning.
