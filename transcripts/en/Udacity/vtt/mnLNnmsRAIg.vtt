00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We go back to our overall master diagram.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What we have is a driver's script which in this case was just the c program.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have a random test case generator which is basically two lines of code--one of them

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we had computed that used a random number to compute the number of bytes to read

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the other one, actually called the read function.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The software under test was the other function--the read all function that we wrote.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The oracle was implemented by memory comparison function--that is to say

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
did the read all command actually read the right bytes from a file--and so as we saw,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the oracle never detect an error since we got the function right and everything work out.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This case of implementing a read all call which is stand in for read that behaves better.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It has been on my mind lately because I assigned this is as one problem on the final exam

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
for my operating systems class that my students finished a couple of weeks ago.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And it turned out that many of the students didn't implement the right code.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A lot of times they forgot in the read all command, for example, to increment buffer so that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
subsequent calls to read wouldn't overwrite the original call to read.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I saw so many of those that I decided I write the function myself and see if it was hard,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and it was a little bit tricky but it worked out and that's why I thought it might

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
make a good example for you all.
