00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.910
Another major difference
between Android security and

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.890
iOS security is code signing.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.970
Android takes a very
different approach from iOS.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.940
In particular,
all apps are self-signed by developers.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.170
A developer can create his own
power key, self sign it to create

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.030
a certificate for its public key and
then use that key to sign his apps.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.200
In other words, third party Android apps
are not signed by a central authority.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.950
There's no vetting process for
third party app developers.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.398
This means that anybody can
become an Android app developer,

00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:40.970
self-sign its apps and
upload it to Android Play Store.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.768
So, if code signing is not used to make
sure that apps are from the vetted or

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:49.860
verified developer, what is it used for?

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.250
Code signing is used for
making sure updates for

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.400
an app are coming from
the same developer.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.520
In addition,
code signing is used to manage

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.069
the trust relationship between apps,
so that they can share code and data.
