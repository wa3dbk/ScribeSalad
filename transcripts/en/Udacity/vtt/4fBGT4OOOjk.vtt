00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.540
When you're logging a message in your app, you need

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.100
to determine what log level it should be displayed at.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.710
Verbose logs should never be compiled into your app, except

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.600
during development. Debug logs are compiled in, but they're stripped

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.210
out at run time. Error, warn, and info logs are

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.650
all kept. And this is what the logging API looks

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.100
like. The first parameter is the log tag, which can

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.320
be any string that you want to identify the log message.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.790
It's good practice to define the log tag as a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.009
constant in your class. Usually it's the name of your class

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.060
or the app. The second parameter is the actual log

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.380
message. If we go back to monitor, we can see that

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.840
this is the log tag column and this is where

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.330
the log message is. If you click on this drop down

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.710
here you can filter the logs by log level. For example

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.600
you can click on Error to see all the error messages.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.060
If you click on warn, you'll see all the warning

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.500
messages as well as anything more severe than that. The

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.550
same goes for the other levels. And verbose means that

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.130
you can see all the logs at all log levels.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.650
As a PROTIP, you should avoid log spam for your sake and

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.400
the sake of other developers. The log buffer could fill up and important

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.500
error messages that you really need to see will either roll of the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.780
logs or it will get lost in the sea of unimportant log messages.
