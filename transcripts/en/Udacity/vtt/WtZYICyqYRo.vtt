00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.031
I can look at this graph and know that the y intercept or this point, is 2. So I

00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:09.850
move 0 in the horizontal direction since I see that's the origin and then I

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.976
moved vertically up to. So our point is 0 comma 2. You might have also set the x

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:19.493
value equal to 0. If you did that, you would still get y is equal to 2.
