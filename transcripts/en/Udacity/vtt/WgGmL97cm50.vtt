00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.140
Now, we're almost done with implementing the car class, but if you have another

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.840
look at the drive method, remember, that we didn't update the gas in tank

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.796
theory variable. That computation is a little bit trickier. Let's first figure

00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:16.492
it out on a sheet of paper. So, let's say we drive 100 miles. How much gas does

00:00:16.492 --> 00:00:21.268
that take? Well, of course, that depends on the fuel efficiency. Let's assume

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:26.290
we have a car with great mileage. 50 miles per gallon. Well, then the gas

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.064
consumed is 100 miles divided by the fuel efficiency or 2 gallons. Right, 50

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:37.017
miles for one gallon, 50 miles for another gallon, for a total of the 100

00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:42.045
miles. That's something that we can easily program in Java and here's the

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:46.997
formula. Let's put that into our code. Of course, that just tells us how much

00:00:46.997 --> 00:00:51.120
gas was consumed during the drive. We still need to update the instance

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.480
variable. Let's do that. Here is it. We reduced gas in tank by the amount of

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.434
gas that was consumed. And we need to set this value here. For now, we'll just

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:05.995
use the value of 50 miles per gallon. We'll later see how we can make every car

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:10.308
have it's own fuel efficiency. Now, how do we know we did this right? This

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:13.269
would be good opportunity for a tester program, and that's what I want you to

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:17.776
do next. Write a tester that constructs a new car, fill the car with gas, drive

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:23.751
the car. Show the gas level, after the drive. And most importantly, print the

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:27.681
expected value. That's what makes a detestor. Go ahead and do that in the

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:30.010
coding environment, and then we'll compare notes.
