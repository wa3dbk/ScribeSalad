00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.090
So the answer is, it's a little bit of both.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.480
It is a random process in the sense that we're modeling intertweet time as

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.970
a random variable and we're taking draws from that variable.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.320
Now, if it was totally random,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.240
we wouldn't be able to do any better than modeling it as an exponential process.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.380
But of course, as we have just found out,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.610
there are clearly features that are influencing this process.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.150
Specifically, length of a tweet and mention distance.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.370
How long it's been since this person has been mentioned by one of

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.330
his close friends.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.890
So it's not as totally deterministic as a functional mapping.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.970
But then on the other hand it's not just complete randomness.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.390
But if I have to chose one or the other, yes is the best answer.
