00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:06.482
So the thing to understand about this first example is that the maximum slowdown is 32.

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:10.448
There are only 32 threads in a warp, so no matter how many cases there are,

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:14.354
no matter how many ways you can branch, you're not going to

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:18.519
branch more than 32 ways in a single warp because there's only 32 threads in that warp.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.433
So again, the maximum here is going to be 32x slowdown for just this segment of code,

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.831
right, for this switch statement in particular. What about this case?

00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:29.867
We're going to switch on the thread index of Y,

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:35.517
so the thing you need to understand is that CUDA assigns thread ideas to warps in such as a way that the X ID varies fastest,

00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:42.114
the Y ID varies slower, the Z ID varies slowest, and this is much more clear if I use a concrete example.

00:00:42.114 --> 00:00:49.050
So in my quiz question I have a 64 by 16 thread block. So let's just draw that out.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.458
Here's a thread with X ID 0, X ID 1, X ID 2 and so forth, and these are the Y IDs.

00:00:55.458 --> 00:01:00.397
This first row has Y ID 1, the second row has Y ID 2, all the way down to Y ID 16,

00:01:00.397 --> 00:01:10.437
and when CUDA assigns these to warps, it will launch a warp with 32 threads comprising X IDs 0 through 31,

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:18.085
then another warp, again with 32 threads containing thread IDs 32 through 63,

00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:25.439
and yet another warp with Y ID equal to 1 and X ID varying from 0 to 31, and so forth.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.554
So now we know the answer to our question.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:33.354
All of the threads in a given warp, in this case, belong to the same Y ID, they all have the same Y ID,

00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:38.500
and that means that we'll get no slowdown at all because all of the threads will be branching to the same place.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.805
What about this next case where we've got a smaller thread block that has 16 by 16 threads?

00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:49.019
So, in this case, we only have 16 X IDs that it can assign to a warp before

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:52.783
it has to change to the next Y ID and start assigning the next set of X IDs,

00:01:52.783 --> 00:01:57.288
so all of these threads will be placed into a single warp.

00:01:57.288 --> 00:02:01.293
The first 16 in the first half of the warp, the next 16 in the next half of the warp,

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:04.627
next all of these threads will be placed in a warp, and so on.

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:10.601
And so now, as you can see, there are 2 different Y IDs for the threads in a single warp.

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:16.772
We'll end up having to execute this code twice for this warp, once with 1 Y ID,

00:02:16.772 --> 00:02:20.777
once with a second Y ID, and we'll end up with a total of a 2x slowdown.
