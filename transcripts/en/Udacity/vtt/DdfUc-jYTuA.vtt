00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What more do we know about K?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's our Lorenz machine, and we have the K wheels.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That's what produces K, and each of these wheels might be a different size.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The first one has 41 positions that are all set to either 0s or 1s.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The second one has 31.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If we're looking at ΔZ for two channels--remember what we were producing here,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
looking at the XOR of ΔZ from channel 0 XORed with ΔZ from channel 1.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's focus just on these two channels--the outputs.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The question is how many different configurations are there

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
for the first two K wheels, the ones for channel 0 and channel 1.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The numbers here are the size of those wheels.
