00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
The answer here is very simple, we have one vertex for each clause.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:11.290
We have 1  m vertices for the clauses. All other coefficients of this answer here are 0.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:18.230
The only vertices that we haven't counted yet are A and B, so there's two additional vertices,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.520
and now we know the total number of vertices that we are using here in our graph that is

00:00:24.520 --> 99:59:59.000
5n + m + 3  mn + 2 vertices in total
