00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.060
I am in a terminal. I am going to fire up

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.950
python and I am going to show you how to use python

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.280
to do hashing for you because we are going to be doing

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.870
a lot of this in this class. One thing we can use

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.260
is hashlib. Hashlib has a couple of hashes available to you.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.100
You have md5, sha1, 256. Those are the ones that we just

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.220
talked about so let's go ahead and get the md5 of something.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.380
The way we do that is we say. X equals hashlib.md5 and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.970
we say.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.360
Now X is this hash object and the way we get something useful out of this is we

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.570
call the hex digest function on them. If we call hex digest on the result of

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.840
md5. We get this string. And this is the md5. Has of the string Fu.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.255
And if I were to change, let's do this all in one line. Let's say

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:55.360
hashlib.md5, hello, hello. Whoops, hello, hello,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.360
and call Hex Digest on it. We can see our

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.560
hash. Now, if I were to just change one of

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.350
these characters, let's say it changed to a capital O

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.410
We can see our hash completely changes. See we had

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.440
f five two blah blah blah two six three here.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.300
So that's a neat property of this particular hashing function

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.900
and if we were to change this back to hello

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.390
hello we get our original hash. What's nice about a hash

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.840
algorithm like M d five its available on every system and if I type if I you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.730
know hash hello hello On any system with MD5,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.230
we're going to get the same result. That’s pretty cool.
