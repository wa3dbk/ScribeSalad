You might wonder why we should care about negative space and

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.580
its relation to data visualization.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.890
And well, we should pay attention to negative space,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.740
because it communicates something about our data.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.860
Let's look at two examples.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.850
This first one explores the London's cholera outbreak in 1854.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.700
John Snow documented deaths around the community to determine what might be

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.740
the cause of the epidemic.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.210
He created this stop map by recording the location of each death by a bar.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.170
The height or the length of these bars indicate that more deaths occurred in

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.950
a particular location.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.480
Knowing this information, I'd like you to answer a question.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.930
Which of these locations have no recorded deaths?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.020
You can use the map that's linked in the instructor notes to figure it out.
