00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.422
The factor that's shared by these two terms is this x minus 1. So you can write

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:08.972
that in, and now it belongs in the second set of parentheses is what's left over

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:13.128
and we divide each term by x minus 1. So you have an x squared here and then

00:00:13.128 --> 00:00:17.576
plus 3 from this term. So that means that we've modified this cubic expression

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:22.712
this third degree polynomial. To equal one linear factor times one quadratic

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:23.280
factor.
