00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.380
The words virtual and virtualization are

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.190
popular these days. From virtual worlds and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.838
virtual reality to applications level virtual machines

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:12.360
like Dalvik or Java's virtual machine. What

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.130
we are concerned with here are virtual platforms. And by platform we mean an

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.840
operating system running on top of some hardware. Let's say Alice has her own

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.980
company, Alice Inc. And she has some cool applications to run for productivity.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.490
And let's say that they're running on a Windows

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.770
machine, on some server that the company maintains. Now,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.780
if cost were not an issue, then this will be the ideal situation for Alice

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.930
Inc. The hope of virtualization is that we will

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.590
be able to give a company perhaps not as well

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.470
endured as Alice Inc., let's's say Bala Inc., almost the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.819
same experience that Alice Inc., gets at a fraction of the

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:10.150
cost. So, instead of a real platform that Alice Inc., has,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.240
Bala Inc., gets a virtual platform. Now, in this diagram,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.700
what I've shown you is a black box

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.660
to represent the virtual platform. Because, so far as

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.210
Bala Inc., is concerned, they don't really care what

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.230
goes on inside this black box? All they want

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.500
is to make sure that the apps that they want to run can run on top of this

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.770
virtual platform. in other words, as long as the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.030
platform affords the same capabilities and the same abstractions

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.960
for running the applications that Bala Inc., wants he is happy. Now,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.840
we however as aspiring operating system designers are

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.670
very much interested in what goes on inside this black

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.830
box. We want to know how we can give Bala Inc., the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.750
illusion of having his own platform without actually giving him one.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.690
And including all of the cost, the implementation

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.530
and maintenance associated with implementing such a virtual platform.
