00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.620
Now that we know the slope, we can replace it in our generic equation. Instead

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.650
of b, we'll have 0.2. We still need to know our y-intercept, though. Which of

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.960
the following, if known, will enable use to find the y-intercept? There's one

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.930
correct answer. A point on the regression line. The standard deviation of the X

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.180
values or any one of the data values, meaning the x and y values for any one of

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.700
these points.
