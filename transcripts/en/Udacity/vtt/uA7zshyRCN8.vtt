00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.043
We've got this wonderful equation but yet again, Grant has neglected to take

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:08.213
everything into account that he needs to think about in terms of his finances.

00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:12.313
It turns out that his rent actually went up $10,000 per month. And he forgot to

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:16.385
tell us that in the information we used to create this equation. So thinking

00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:20.637
about this new piece of information, how do we modify our equation for profit?

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:25.427
Think about this carefully. If Grant's rent increases, then the amount of money

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:29.827
that he spends will increase. So think about what that should do for profit

00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:30.425
overall.
